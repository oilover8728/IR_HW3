7260,The educational role of IBD nurses in Italy in vaccinations: do not miss the moment for COVID-19.,"Objective: The role of nurses has great educational-scientific potential in COVID-19 vaccination. The aim of this work is to clarify whether the educational role of IBD nurses in vaccination is perceived by IBD patients. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out, through a questionnaire, to evaluate how many IBD patients received health education about vaccinations from the dedicated nurses (IBD nurses). Results: There were four hundred questionnaires, 310 patients (77.5%) answered all questions. The nurse does not appear to help educate patients on influenza vaccination (66.1%) or pneumococcal vaccination (81.6%). Disclosed patients have many doubts about the new COVID-19 vaccination (74.4%) and many seek information (74.8%) and think that the nurse can provide the necessary information (70%). Conclusions: IBD nurses do not seem very active in the vaccination education role, and they do not meet patients' expectations, which are conversely very high."

7262,Scientific research progress of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 in the first five months.,"A cluster of pneumonia (COVID-19) cases have been found in Wuhan China in late December, 2019, and subsequently, a novel coronavirus with a positive stranded RNA was identified to be the aetiological virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 transmits mainly through droplets and close contact and the elder or people with chronic diseases are high-risk population. People affected by SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic, which brings about more difficulties to control the transmission. COVID-19 has become pandemic rapidly after onset, and so far the infected people have been above 2 000 000 and more than 130 000 died worldwide according to COVID-19 situation dashboard of World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int). Here, we summarized the current known knowledge regarding epidemiological, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, comorbidities and treatment of COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 as reference for the prevention and control COVID-19."
7263,Pooling of coronavirus tests under unknown prevalence.,"Diagnostic testing for the novel coronavirus is an important tool to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. However, testing capacities are limited. A modified testing protocol, whereby a number of probes are 'pooled' (i.e. grouped), is known to increase the capacity for testing. Here, we model pooled testing with a double-average model, which we think to be close to reality for Covid-19 testing. The optimal pool size and the effect of test errors are considered. The results show that the best pool size is three to five, under reasonable assumptions. Pool testing even reduces the number of false positives in the absence of dilution effects."
7264,"SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant among Asiatic Lions, India.","In May 2021, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detected in Asiatic lions in a zoological park in India. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed the SARS-CoV-2 strains were the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. To reduce transmission of variants of concern, surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wild animal populations should be increased."
7265,"Immunoinformatics prediction of overlapping CD8(+) T-cell, IFN-gamma and IL-4 inducer CD4(+) T-cell and linear B-cell epitopes based vaccines against COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).","At the beginning of the year 2020, the world was struck with a global pandemic virus referred to as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) which has left hundreds of thousands of people dead. To control this virus, vaccine design becomes imperative. In this study, potential epitopes-based vaccine candidates were explored. Six hundred (600) genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the viPR database to generate CD8+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell and linear B-cell epitopes which were screened for antigenicity, immunogenicity and non-allergenicity. The results of this study provide 19 promising candidate CD8+ T-cell epitopes that strongly overlap with 8 promising B-cells epitopes. Another 19 CD4+ T-cell epitopes were also identified that can induce IFN-Î³ and IL-4 cytokines. The most conserved MHC-I and MHC-II for both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes are HLA-A*02:06 and HLA-DRB1*01:01 respectively. These epitopes also bound to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). The population coverage of the conserved Major Histocompatibility Complex Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) for both CD8+ T-cell and CD4+ T-cell ranged from 65.6% to 100%. The detailed analysis of the potential epitope-based vaccine and their mapping to the complete COVID-19 genome reveals that they are predominantly found in the location of the surface (S) and membrane (M) glycoproteins suggesting the potential involvement of these structural proteins in the immunogenic response and antigenicity of the virus. Since the majority of the potential epitopes are located on M protein, the design of multi-epitope vaccine with the structural protein is highly promising though the whole M protein could also serve as a viable epitope for the development of an attenuated vaccine. Our findings provide a baseline for the experimental design of a suitable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2."
7266,Animal Coronavirus Diseases: Parallels with COVID-19 in Humans.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus in humans, has expanded globally over the past year. COVID-19 remains an important subject of intensive research owing to its huge impact on economic and public health globally. Based on historical archives, the first coronavirus-related disease recorded was possibly animal-related, a case of feline infectious peritonitis described as early as 1912. Despite over a century of documented coronaviruses in animals, the global animal industry still suffers from outbreaks. Knowledge and experience handling animal coronaviruses provide a valuable tool to complement our understanding of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we present an overview of coronaviruses, clinical signs, COVID-19 in animals, genome organization and recombination, immunopathogenesis, transmission, viral shedding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. By drawing parallels between COVID-19 in animals and humans, we provide perspectives on the pathophysiological mechanisms by which coronaviruses cause diseases in both animals and humans, providing a critical basis for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against these deadly viruses."
7267,COVID-19: from an acute to chronic disease? Potential long-term health consequences.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite pulmonary impairments being the most prevalent, extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are abundant. Confirmed COVID-19 cases have now surpassed 57.8 million worldwide as of 22 November 2020. With estimated case fatality rates (number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by number of confirmed COVID-19 cases) varying between 1 and 7%, there will be a large population of recovered COVID-19 patients that may acquire a multitude of long-term health consequences. While the multi-organ manifestations of COVID-19 are now well-documented, the potential long-term implications of these manifestations remain to be uncovered. In this review, we turn to previous similar coronaviruses (i.e. SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) in combination with known health implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection to predict potential long-term effects of COVID-19, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematologic, renal, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and psychosocial manifestations, in addition to the well-known post-intensive care syndrome. It is necessary to monitor COVID-19 patients after discharge to understand the breadth and severity of long-term effects. This can be accomplished by repurposing or initiating large cohort studies to not only focus on the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also on acquired immune function as well as ethno-racial group and household income disparities in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The future for COVID-19 survivors remains uncertain, and if this virus circulates among us for years to come, long-term effects may accumulate exponentially."
7268,The COVID-19 Data Portal: accelerating SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research through rapid open access data sharing.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic will be remembered as one of the defining events of the 21st century. The rapid global outbreak has had significant impacts on human society and is already responsible for millions of deaths. Understanding and tackling the impact of the virus has required a worldwide mobilisation and coordination of scientific research. The COVID-19 Data Portal (https://www.covid19dataportal.org/) was first released as part of the European COVID-19 Data Platform, on April 20th 2020 to facilitate rapid and open data sharing and analysis, to accelerate global SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research. The COVID-19 Data Portal has fortnightly feature releases to continue to add new data types, search options, visualisations and improvements based on user feedback and research. The open datasets and intuitive suite of search, identification and download services, represent a truly FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) resource that enables researchers to easily identify and quickly obtain the key datasets needed for their COVID-19 research."
7269,"The SARS-Coronavirus Infection Cycle: A Survey of Viral Membrane Proteins, Their Functional Interactions and Pathogenesis.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel epidemic strain of Betacoronavirus that is responsible for the current viral pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a global health crisis. Other epidemic Betacoronaviruses include the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 and the 2009 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the genomes of which, particularly that of SARS-CoV-1, are similar to that of the 2019 SARS-CoV-2. In this extensive review, we document the most recent information on Coronavirus proteins, with emphasis on the membrane proteins in the Coronaviridae family. We include information on their structures, functions, and participation in pathogenesis. While the shared proteins among the different coronaviruses may vary in structure and function, they all seem to be multifunctional, a common theme interconnecting these viruses. Many transmembrane proteins encoded within the SARS-CoV-2 genome play important roles in the infection cycle while others have functions yet to be understood. We compare the various structural and nonstructural proteins within the Coronaviridae family to elucidate potential overlaps and parallels in function, focusing primarily on the transmembrane proteins and their influences on host membrane arrangements, secretory pathways, cellular growth inhibition, cell death and immune responses during the viral replication cycle. We also offer bioinformatic analyses of potential viroporin activities of the membrane proteins and their sequence similarities to the Envelope (E) protein. In the last major part of the review, we discuss complement, stimulation of inflammation, and immune evasion/suppression that leads to CoV-derived severe disease and mortality. The overall pathogenesis and disease progression of CoVs is put into perspective by indicating several stages in the resulting infection process in which both host and antiviral therapies could be targeted to block the viral cycle. Lastly, we discuss the development of adaptive immunity against various structural proteins, indicating specific vulnerable regions in the proteins. We discuss current CoV vaccine development approaches with purified proteins, attenuated viruses and DNA vaccines."
