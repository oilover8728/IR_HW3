5400,Sequential battery of COVID-19 testing to maximize negative predictive value before surgeries.,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus which has proven to be highly contagious. Specific viral dynamics and immune response to the virus are yet to be fully defined and determining the sensitivity and specificity of the available testing methods is still a work in progress. This study examines the published information on the testing methods, and finds that yield of COVID-19 tests changes with specimen types and with time through course of illness. We propose a sequential battery of testing consisting of an epidemiologic survey, RT-PCR tests, serologic tests and chest CT on surgical candidates which may increase the negative predictive value, and facilitate surgical procedures."
5401,Operations management on the front line of COVID-19 vaccination: building capability at scale via technology-enhanced learning.,"The globe is gripped by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mass population vaccination is seen as the solution. As vaccines become available, governments aim to deploy them as rapidly as possible. It is important, therefore, that the efficiency of vaccination processes is optimal.Operations management is concerned with improving processes and comprises systematic approaches such as Lean. Lean focuses explicitly on process efficiency through the elimination of non-value adding steps to optimise processes for those who use and depend on them.Technology-enhanced learning can be a strategy to build improvement capability at scale. A massive online programme to build capability in Lean has been developed by the regulator of England's National Health Service. Beta testing of this programme has been used by some test sites to refine their COVID-19 vaccination processes. The paper presents a case example of massive online learning supporting the use of Lean in the day-to-day operations management of COVID-19 vaccine processes.The case example illustrates the challenges that vaccination processes may present and the need for responsive and effective operations management. Building capability to respond rapidly and systematically in dynamic situations to optimise flow, safety and patient experience may be beneficial.Given the national imperative to achieve mass vaccination as rapidly as possible, systematic improvement methods such as Lean may have a contribution to make. Massive online programmes, such as that described here, may help with this effort by achieving timely knowledge transfer at large scale."
5402,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students in India.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine was launched in India on 16 January 2021, prioritising health care workers which included medical students. We aimed to assess vaccine hesitancy and factors related to it among medical students in India. An online questionnaire was filled by 1068 medical students across 22 states and union territories of India from 2 February to 7 March 2021. Vaccine hesitancy was found among 10.6%. Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, lack of awareness regarding their eligibility for vaccination and lack of trust in government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students. On the other hand, the presence of risk perception regarding themselves being affected with COVID-19 reduced vaccine hesitancy as well as hesitancy in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Vaccine-hesitant students were more likely to derive information from social media and less likely from teachers at their medical colleges. Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was considered important by medical students both for themselves and for their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students. Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face classes and get their personal life back on track. Around three-fourths medical students viewed that COVID-19 vaccine should be made mandatory for both health care workers and international travellers. Prior adult vaccination did not have an effect on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Targeted awareness campaigns, regulatory oversight of vaccine trials and public release of safety and efficacy data and trust building activities could further reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students."
5403,A high-throughput microsphere-based immunoassay of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM testing for COVID-19 diagnostics.,"The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 is rapidly expanding across the world. A positive result of antibody tests suggests that the individual has potentially been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, thus allowing to identify asymptomatic infections and determine the seroprevalence in a given population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly developed high throughput immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody detection on the Luminex MAGPIX platform. Clinical agreement studies were performed in 42 COVID-19 patient serum samples and 162 negative donor serum/plasma samples. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was 42.86% (95% CI: 9.90% to 81.59%), 71.43% (95% CI: 29.04% to 96.33%), and 28.57% (95% CI: 13.22% to 48.67%) for samples collected on 0-7 days, 8-14 days, and 2-8 weeks from symptom onset, respectively. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was 97.53% (95% CI: 93.80% to 99.32%). There was no cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Hemoglobin (200 mg/dL), bilirubin (2 mg/dL), triglyceride (250 mg/dL) and EDTA (10 mM) showed no significant interfering effect on this assay. In conclusion, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody assay with high sensitivity and specificity has been developed. With the high throughput, this assay will speed up the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM testing."

5405,COVID-19-Impfungen: Replizierend oder Nichtreplizierend?,"Innovative and effective vaccination strategies are the most important lever to address the global SARS-COV2 pandemic. Within months scientists all over the world have developed promising new vaccines, many of which use adenoviral vectors to incorporate immunogenic molecules of SARS-coronavirus in order to elicit effective immune responses. The Gamaleya institute developed the COVID-19 vaccine named Sputnik (Gam-COVID-Vac) using adenoviral vectors ad 26 and ad5 to incorporate a full SARS-Spike Protein for vaccination. Two differing vectors enable so called prime-boost, thus avoiding neutralizing effects against the vector itself, ensuring proper immunogenicity against the vaccine. Current available published evidence has raised controversy among small sample sizes in phase II and early endpoints in phase III studies with Sputnik and scientific community took notice that full study protocols and clinical data haven't been made available yet. Patient subgroups and vaccination efficacy in healthy vaccinated may be at risk in case of partial viral replication of Ad5 vectors or when batch to batch reproducibility is not warranted, as concerns from authorities in Brazil and Slovakia have recently been raised. Final approval by governing health authorities (e. g. EMA) should therefore be awaited."

5407,Exercise Is Medicine for Immune Function: Implication for COVID-19.,"This review supports that physical activity improves immunosurveillance and has the potential to counter COVID-19 infection and symptomatology at three prevention levels. At the primary prevention level, several lines of evidence support that physical activity is an immune system adjuvant in combating infectious diseases. Recent epidemiological studies indicate that regular physical activity is associated with a reduced risk for COVID-19, similar to what has been reported for other respiratory infections. Although specific COVID-19-related studies are needed, data from investigations with other types of infectious agents, such as influenza, support the potential role of physical activity in augmenting COVID-19 vaccine efficacy (secondary prevention level). There is a growing awareness that COVID-19 can cause sustained morbidity in some patients, and physical training and rehabilitation (tertiary prevention level) can be directed toward improvement in physical fitness, quality of life, and immune health."
5408,Patient characteristics associated with COVID-19 positivity and fatality in Nigeria: retrospective cohort study.,"Objective: Despite the increasing disease burden, there is a dearth of context-specific evidence on the risk factors for COVID-19 positivity and subsequent death in Nigeria. Thus, the study objective was to identify context-specific factors associated with testing positive for COVID-19 and fatality in Nigeria. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: COVID-19 surveillance and laboratory centres in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory reporting data to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Participants: Individuals who were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time PCR testing during the study period 27 February-8 June 2020. Methods: COVID-19 positivity and subsequent mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors independently associated with both outcome variables, and findings are presented as adjusted ORs (aORs) and 95% CIs. Results: A total of 36 496 patients were tested for COVID-19, with 10 517 confirmed cases. Of 3215 confirmed cases with available clinical outcomes, 295 died. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 positivity were older age (p value for trend<0.0001), male sex (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.18) and the following presenting symptoms: cough (aOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.32), fever (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.71), loss of smell (aOR 7.78, 95% CI 5.19 to 11.66) and loss of taste (aOR 2.50, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.90). An increased risk of mortality following COVID-19 was observed in those aged ≥51 years, patients in farming occupation (aOR 7.56, 95% CI 1.70 to 33.53) and those presenting with cough (aOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.01), breathing difficulties (aOR 5.68, 95% CI 3.77 to 8.58) and vomiting (aOR 2.54, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.84). Conclusion: The significant risk factors associated with COVID-19 positivity and subsequent mortality in the Nigerian population are similar to those reported in studies from other countries and should guide clinical decisions for COVID-19 testing and specialist care referrals."
5409,Uptake of vaccination in pregnancy.,"Maternal immunisation is a public health strategy that aims to provide protection against certain infections to both mother and her foetus or newborn child. Vaccination of pregnant women induces vaccine-specific antibodies that lead to the subsequent transfer of these antibodies across the placenta or through breastfeeding to the offspring. At present, vaccinations in pregnancy are limited to pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, polio, and the seasonal Influenza vaccine. Recently, some countries have incorporated routine antenatal vaccinations in their national immunisation programmes. Future vaccines targeted at pregnant women such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Group B streptococcus (GBS) are under development. The recently approved Covid-19 vaccines have no safety data for use in pregnancy at present, but have been considered in the UK in extremely vulnerable pregnant women or pregnant frontline health and social care workers. In this article, we review the evidence supporting maternal immunisation and discuss the uptake of vaccines in pregnant women, challenges of recording the data on vaccine coverage, and consider reasons behind the present levels of uptake and strategies for future improvements."
