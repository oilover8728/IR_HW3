5420,Longitudinal observation of antibody responses for 14 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Better understanding of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection might provide valuable insights into the future implementation of vaccination policies. Longitudinal analysis of IgG antibody titers was carried out in 32 recovered COVID-19 patients based in the Umbria region of Italy for 14 months after Mild and Moderately-Severe infection.Two FDA-approved immunoassays against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (NCP) and anti-spike-receptor binding domain (S-RBD) were used for sequential serological tests at different time points. The demographics,clinical history and symptom profile associated with the magnitude and longevity of antibody responses were also analyzed. Anti-S-RBD IgG persisted in 96.8% (31 of 32) subjects at 14 months. Patients reporting loss of smell and taste during the clinical course of the disease developed significantly higher antibody titers. Anti-NCP IgG seronegative patients(n=7) at 10 months, tested positive for anti-S-RBD IgG at 12,13 and 14 months emphasizing on a higher false-negative rate for NCP protein-based antibody assays. This study also highlights the importance of adopting specific immunoassays for routine estimation of antibody titers and the decreased rate of re-infections in recovered patients."
5421,"The Perspective of Coronavirus Disease Outbreak: Epidemiology, Transmission, and Possible Treatment.","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan city of China has now spread to 214 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances (the Diamond Princess cruise ship harbored in Yokohama, Japan and the Holland America's MS Zaandam cruise ship) as of October 11, 2020. The disease has been named as a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus causing the disease is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There are currently about 36,754,395 confirmed COVID-19-infected cases and 1,064,838 confirmed deaths as of October 11, 2020. The study is intended to understand the origin, transmission and impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The virus has not been encountered by humans previously and is therefore known as a novel. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading to new areas and has become a serious challenge for the scientific community in particular and the whole world population in general. The focus of the study is based on the transmission, epidemiology, genetic makeup, and possible remedies to control and contain the disease. It also includes the global impact of SARS-CoV-2 on health care and the world economy. The present review summarizes the current knowledge highlighting the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis, and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease."
5422,The First Disease X is Caused by a Highly Transmissible Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.,"Based on the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, the Wuhan pneumonia caused by an unknown etiology should be recognized as the first Disease X. Later, the pathogen was identified to be a novel coronavirus denoted 2019-nCoV, which has 79.5% and 96% whole genome sequence identify to SARS-CoV and bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13), respectively, suggesting its potential bat origin. With high human-to-human transmission rate (R0), 2019-nCoV has quickly spread in China and other countries, resulting in 34,953 confirmed cases and 725 deaths as of 8 February 2020, thus calling for urgent development of therapeutics and prophylactics. Here we suggest renaming 2019-nCoV as ""transmissible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (TARS-CoV)"" and briefly review the advancement of research and development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and viral fusion inhibitors targeting the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain in spike protein of 2019-nCoV."
5423,"Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of pediatric COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. This meta-analysis was aimed at describing the clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics of children with COVID-19 based on published data of pediatric COVID-19 cases.Search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Sciences, Science Direct, and Google Scholar for articles published until December 14, 2020, that described the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of children with COVID-19. Data were extracted independently by 2 authors. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to report pooled results.Clinical data from 2874 children with COVID-19 from 37 articles were finally included for quantitative analyses. Fever (48.5%, 95% CI: 41.4%-55.6%) and cough (40.6%, 95% CI: 33.9%-47.5%) were the most common symptoms; asymptomatic infection and severe cases, respectively, accounted for 27.7% (95% CI: 19.7%-36.4%) patients and 1.1% of the 1933 patients included. Laboratory tests showed 5.5% (95% CI: 2.8%-8.9%) of the patients had lymphopenia. The pooled prevalence of leukopenia was 7.3% (95% CI: 3.4%-12.2%), and the C-reactive protein level was high in 14.0% (95% CI: 6.8%-22.8%). Chest computed tomography showed unilateral and bilateral lesions, and ground-glass opacity in 29.4% (95% CI: 24.8%-34.3%) and 24.7% (95% CI: 18.2%-31.6%), and 32.9% (95% CI: 25.3%-40.9%), respectively, and normal in approximately 36.0% (95% CI: 27.7%-44.7%).We found that children with COVID-19 had relatively mild disease, with quite a lot of asymptomatic infections and low rate of severe illness. Data from more regions are needed to determine the prevention and treatment strategies for children with COVID-19."

5425,Experience of a Tertiary Hospital in Singapore with Management of a Dual Outbreak of COVID-19 and Dengue.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, distinguishing dengue from cases of COVID-19 in endemic areas can be difficult. In a tertiary hospital contending with COVID-19 during a dengue epidemic, a triage strategy of routine COVID-19 testing for febrile patients with viral prodromes was used. All febrile patients with viral prodromes and no epidemiologic risk for COVID-19 were first admitted to a designated ward for COVID-19 testing, where enhanced personal protective equipment was used by healthcare workers until COVID-19 was ruled out. From January to May 2020, 11,086 admissions were screened for COVID-19; 868 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in our institution, along with 380 cases of dengue. Only 8.5% (943/11,086) of suspected COVID-19 cases were concurrently tested for dengue serology due to a compatible overlapping clinical syndrome, and dengue was established as an alternative diagnosis in 2% (207/10,218) of suspected COVID-19 cases that tested negative. There were eight COVID-19 cases with likely false-positive dengue serology and one probable COVID-19/dengue coinfection. From April to May 2020, 251 admissions presenting as viral prodromes with no respiratory symptoms were screened; of those, 15 cases had COVID-19, and 2/15 had false-positive dengue IgM. Epidemiology investigations showed no healthcare-associated transmission. In a dengue epidemic season coinciding with a COVID-19 pandemic, dengue was established as an alternative diagnosis in a minority of COVID-19 suspects, likely due to early availability of basic diagnostics. Routine screening of patients with viral prodromes during a dual outbreak of COVID-19 and dengue enabled containment of COVID-19 cases masquerading as dengue with false-positive IgM."

5427,Temporary Regulatory Deviations and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR Labeling Update Study Indicate What Laboratory-Developed Test Regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Could Look Like.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) response necessitated innovations and a series of regulatory deviations that also affected laboratory-developed tests (LDTs). To examine real-world consequences and specify regulatory paradigm shifts, legislative proposals were aligned on a common timeline with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of LDTs and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-orchestrated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) labeling update study. The initial EUA adoption by LDT developers shows that the FDA can have oversight over LDTs. We used efficiency-corrected microcosting of our EUA PCR assay to estimate the national cost of the labeling update study to $0.3 to $1.4 million US dollars. Labeling update study performance data showed lower average detection limits in commercial in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays versus LDTs (32,000 ± 75,000 versus 71,000 ± 147,000 nucleic acid amplification tests/mL; P = 0.04); however, comparison also shows that FDA review of IVD assays and LDTs did not prevent differences between initial and labeling update performance (IVD assay, P < 0.0001; LDT, P = 0.003). The regulatory shifts re-emphasized that both commercial tests and LDTs rely heavily on laboratory competence and procedures; however, lack of performance data on authorized tests, when clinically implemented, precludes assessment of the benefit related to regulatory review. Temporary regulatory deviations during the pandemic and regulatory science tools (ie, reference material) have generated valuable real-world evidence to inform pending legislation regarding LDT regulation."
5428,Infectivity assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from patients with COVID-19.,"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, laboratory diagnosis has mainly been conducted using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detecting the presence of an infectious virus in the collected sample is essential to analyze if a person can transmit infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there have been no quantitative investigations conducted for infectious SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. Therefore, in the present study, a rapid and simple focus-forming assay using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique was developed to quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2 titers in 119 samples (n = 52, nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS]; n = 67, saliva) from patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the study findings were compared with the cycle threshold (Ct) values of real-time RT-PCR. The infectious virus titers in NPS samples and Ct values were inversely correlated, and no infectious virus could be detected when the Ct value exceeded 30. In contrast, a low correlation was observed between the infectious virus titers in saliva and Ct values (r = -0.261, p = 0.027). Furthermore, the infectious virus titers in the saliva were significantly lower than those in the NPS samples. Ten days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, the infectious virus was undetectable, and Ct values were more than 30 in NSP and saliva samples. The results indicate that patients whose symptoms subsided 10 days after onset, with Ct values more than 30 in NSP and saliva samples, were less likely to infect others."
5429,Anchor-Locker Binding Mechanism of the Coronavirus Spike Protein to Human ACE2: Insights from Computational Analysis.,"COVID-19 has emerged as the most serious international pandemic in early 2020 and the lack of comprehensive knowledge in the recognition and transmission mechanisms of this virus hinders the development of suitable therapeutic strategies. The specific recognition during the binding of the spike glycoprotein (S protein) of coronavirus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the host cell is widely considered the first step of infection. However, detailed insights on the underlying mechanism of dynamic recognition and binding of these two proteins remain unknown. In this work, molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation were carried out to systematically compare and analyze the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of six coronavirus' S proteins. We found that affinity and stability of the RBD from SARS-CoV-2 under the binding state with ACE2 are stronger than those of other coronaviruses. The solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) and binding free energy of different RBD subunits indicate an ""anchor-locker"" recognition mechanism involved in the binding of the S protein to ACE2. Loop 2 (Y473-F490) acts as an anchor for ACE2 recognition, and Loop 3 (G496-V503) locks ACE2 at the other nonanchoring end. Then, the charged or long-chain residues in the β-sheet 1 (N450-F456) region reinforce this binding. The proposed binding mechanism was supported by umbrella sampling simulation of the dissociation process. The current computational study provides important theoretical insights for the development of new vaccines against SARS-CoV-2."
