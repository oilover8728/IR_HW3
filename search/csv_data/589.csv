5880,COVID-19 and Hyperimmune sera: A feasible plan B to fight against coronavirus.,"Since the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, different treatment strategies have been explored. These mainly involve the development of antimicrobial, antiviral, and/or anti-inflammatory agents as well as vaccine production. However, other potential options should be more avidly investigated since vaccine production on a worldwide level, and the anti-vaccination movement, also known as anti-vax or vaccine hesitancy by many communities, are still real obstacles without a ready solution. This review presents recent findings on the potential therapeutic advantages of heterologous serotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19. We present not only the effective use in animal models of hyperimmune sera against this coronavirus but also strategies, and protocols for the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 sera. Promising antigens are also indicated such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is already in phase 2/3 clinical trial, and the trimeric protein S, which was shown to be up to 150 times more potent than the serum from convalescent donors. Due to the high death rate, the treatment for those currently infected with coronavirus cannot be ignored. Therefore, the potential use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune sera should be carefully but urgently evaluated in phase 2/3 clinical studies."
5881,"Risk, Trust, and Flawed Assumptions: Vaccine Hesitancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","Background: The pace at which the present pandemic and future public health crises involving viral infections are eradicated heavily depends on the availability and routine implementation of vaccines. This process is further affected by a willingness to vaccinate, embedded in the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. The World Health Organization has listed vaccine hesitancy among the greatest threats to global health, calling for research to identify the factors associated with this phenomenon. Methods: The present cross-sectional study seeks to investigate the psychological, contextual, and sociodemographic factors associated with vaccination hesitancy in a large sample of the adult population. 4,571 Norwegian adults were recruited through an online survey between January 23 to February 2, 2021. Subgroup analyzes and multiple logistic regression was utilized to identify the covariates of vaccine hesitancy. Results: Several subgroups hesitant toward vaccination were identified, including males, rural residents, and parents with children below 18 years of age. No differences were found between natives and non-natives, across education or age groups. Individuals preferring unmonitored media platforms (e.g., information from peers, social media, online forums, and blogs) more frequently reported hesitance toward vaccination than those relying on information obtainment from source-verified platforms. Perceived risk of vaccination, belief in the superiority of natural immunity, fear concerning significant others being infected by the virus, and trust in health officials' dissemination of vaccine-related information were identified as key variables related to vaccine hesitancy. Conclusion: Given the heterogeneous range of variables associated with vaccine hesitancy, additional strategies to eradicate vaccination fears are called for aside from campaigns targeting the spread of false information. Responding to affective reactions in addition to involving other community leaders besides government and health officials present promising approaches that may aid in combating vaccination hesitation."
5882,COVID-19 screening protocols for preoperative assessment of head and neck cancer patients candidate for elective surgery in the midst of the pandemic: A narrative review with comparison between two Italian institutions.,"Background: Preoperative screening had a key role in planning elective surgical activity for head and neck cancer (HNC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: All patients undergoing surgery for HNC at two Italian referral hospitals (University of Padua and National Cancer Institute [NCI]) during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy were included. Accuracy of screening protocols was assessed. Results: In the Padua protocol, 41 patients were screened by pharyngeal swab. The entire sample (100%) was admitted to surgery, diagnostic accuracy was 100%. In the NCI protocol, 23 patients underwent a telephone interview, blood test, and chest CT. Twenty patients (87%) were negative and were directly admitted to surgery. In the remaining 3 (13%), pharyngeal swab was performed. The screening was repeated until a negative chest CT was found. Diagnostic accuracy was 85%. Conclusions: Dedicated screening protocols for COVID-19 allow to safely perform elective HNC surgery."

5885,"Evaluation of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel, the First Rapid Multiplex PCR Commercial Assay for SARS-CoV-2 Detection.","In the race to contain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), efficient detection and triage of infected patients must rely on rapid and reliable testing. In this work, we performed the first evaluation of the QIAstat-Dx respiratory SARS-CoV-2 panel (QIAstat-SARS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This assay is the first rapid multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay, including SARS-CoV-2 detection, and is fully compatible with a non-PCR-trained laboratory or point-of-care (PoC) testing. This evaluation was performed using 69 primary clinical samples (66 nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], 1 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample [BAL], 1 tracheal aspirate sample, and 1 bronchial aspirate sample) comparing SARS-CoV-2 detection with the currently WHO-recommended reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (WHO-RT-PCR) workflow. Additionally, a comparative limit of detection (LoD) assessment was performed for QIAstat-SARS and WHO-RT-PCR using a quantified clinical sample. Compatibility of sample pretreatment for viral neutralization or viscous samples with the QIAstat-SARS system were also tested. The QIAstat-Dx respiratory SARS-CoV-2 panel demonstrated a sensitivity comparable to that of the WHO-recommended assay with a limit of detection at 1,000 copies/ml. The overall percent agreement between QIAstat-Dx SARS and WHO-RT-PCR on 69 clinical samples was 97% with a sensitivity of 100% (40/40) and specificity at 93% (27/29). No cross-reaction was encountered for any other respiratory viruses or bacteria included in the panel. The QIAstat-SARS rapid multiplex PCR panel provides a highly sensitive, robust, and accurate assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. This assay allows rapid decisions even in non-PCR-trained laboratory or point-of-care testing, allowing innovative organization."
5886,"Adapting for the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador, a characterization of hospital strategies and patients.","The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. In Ecuador, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 29 February 2020. Despite efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 overran the Ecuadorian public health system, which became one of the most affected in Latin America on 24 April 2020. The Hospital General del Sur de Quito (HGSQ) had to transition from a general to a specific COVID-19 health center in a short period of time to fulfill the health demand from patients with respiratory afflictions. Here, we summarized the implementations applied in the HGSQ to become a COVID-19 exclusive hospital, including the rearrangement of hospital rooms and a triage strategy based on a severity score calculated through an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted chest computed tomography (CT). Moreover, we present clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data from 75 laboratory tested COVID-19 patients, which represent the first outbreak of Quito city. The majority of patients were male with a median age of 50 years. We found differences in laboratory parameters between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU cases considering C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocytes. Sensitivity and specificity of the AI-assisted chest CT were 21.4% and 66.7%, respectively, when considering a score >70%; regardless, this system became a cornerstone of hospital triage due to the lack of RT-PCR testing and timely results. If health workers act as vectors of SARS-CoV-2 at their domiciles, they can seed outbreaks that might put 1,879,047 people at risk of infection within 15 km around the hospital. Despite our limited sample size, the information presented can be used as a local example that might aid future responses in low and middle-income countries facing respiratory transmitted epidemics."
5887,Performance comparison of the Cobas Liat and Cepheid GeneXpert systems on SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swab and posterior oropharyngeal saliva.,"Background: Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) based methods such as real-time reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) are the gold standard for diagnosis of current infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The cobas® Liat® and cepheid® GeneXpert® systems are two rapid real-time RT-PCR platforms offering rapid, specimen-to-answer detection of SARS-CoV-2.Research design and methods: In this study, we compared the performance of these two systems on SARS-CoV-2 detection in 9 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and 70 posterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens collected from 79 patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection between August 2020 and March 2021.Results: The Positive Percent Agreement (PPA), Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) and overall Percent Agreement (OPA) between cepheid® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay and cobas® Liat® SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay were found to be 100%. We demonstrated an excellent overall test concordance of the Liat® SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay and Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. The small sample size of SARS-CoV-2 positive and weak-positive specimens is the inherent limitation of this study.Conclusions: The performance of the cobas® Liat® SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay is equivalent to the cepheid® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection using NPS and posterior oropharyngeal saliva."
5888,The Novel Insight of SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Biology and Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Options.,"On December 31, 2019, a novel coronavirus, being the third highly infective CoV and named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the city of Wuhan, was announced by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has a 2% mortality rate, is known as the third extremely infective CoV infection, and has a mortality rate less than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The CoV family comprises a chief number of positive single-stranded ss (+) RNA viruses that are recognized in mammals. The 2019-nCoV patients showed that the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) was the same for SARS-CoV. Structural proteins have an essential role in virus released and budding to various host cells. Notably, evidence indicated human-to-human transmission, along with several exported patients of virus infection worldwide. Nowadays, no licensed antivirals drugs or vaccines for being utilized against these coronavirus infections are recognized. There is an urgent requirement for an extensive research of CoV infections to disclose the route of extension, pathogenesis, and diagnosis and then to recognize the therapeutic targets to facilitate disease control and surveillance. In this article, we present an overview of the common biological criteria of CoVs and explain pathogenesis with a focus on the therapeutic approach to suggest potential goals for treating and monitoring this emerging zoonotic disease."
5889,The demand for a COVID-19 vaccine in Ecuador.,"In Latin America, the country of Ecuador was one of the first and most severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the demand for a COVID-19 vaccine in Ecuador by estimating individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for the vaccine, and by assessing the effect of vaccine attributes (duration of protection and efficacy) and individuals' characteristics on this valuation. The sample used (N = 1,050) was obtained through an online survey conducted from April 2 to April 7, 2020. Two levels of vaccine efficacy (70% and 98%) and two levels of vaccine duration of protection (1 and 20 years) were considered. The willingness to pay estimates were obtained using a double-bounded dichotomous-choice contingent valuation format. Survey results show that a very large proportion of individuals (at least 97%) were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, and at least 85% of individuals were willing to pay a positive amount for that vaccine. Conservative estimates of the average WTP values ranged from USD 147.61 to 196.65 and the median WTP from USD 76.9 to 102.5. Only the duration of protection was found to influence individuals' WTP for the vaccine (p < 0.01). On average, respondents were willing to pay 30% more for a COVID-19 vaccine with 20 years of protection relative to the vaccine with 1 year of protection. Regression results show that WTP for the vaccine was associated with income, employment status, the perceived probability of needing hospitalization if contracting the virus causing COVID-19, and region of residence."
