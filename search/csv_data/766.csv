7650,Traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Peripheral Blood Cells of Patients with COVID-19.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third virus that caused coronavirus-related outbreaks over the past 20 years. The outbreak was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, but rapidly progressed into a pandemic of an unprecedented scale since the 1918 flu pandemic. Besides respiratory complications in patients with COVID-19, clinical characterization of severe infection cases showed several other comorbidities, including multiple organ failure, and septic shock. To better understand the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19, we interrogated the virus's presence in the peripheral blood cells, which might provide a form of trafficking or hiding to the virus. By analyzing >2 billion sequence reads of high-throughput transcriptome sequence data from 180 samples of patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection or healthy controls collected from 6 studies, we found evidence of traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in two samples from two independent studies. In contrast, the viral RNA was abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the same patients. We also devised a ""viral spike-to-actin"" RNA normalization as a metric to compare across various samples and minimize errors caused by intersample variability in total human RNA abundance. Our observation suggests immune presentation and discounts the possibility of extensive viral infection of lymphocytes or monocytes."
7651,The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Epidemic in Zimbabwe: Quo Vadis?,"The trajectory and impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa are unclear, but they are seemingly varied between different countries, with most reporting low numbers. We use the situation in Zimbabwe to build an argument that the epidemic is likely to be attenuated in some countries with similar socioeconomic and cultural structures. However, even an attenuated epidemic may overwhelm weak health systems, emphasizing the importance of prevention. These prevention strategies should be tailored to the unique social and cultural networks of individual countries, which may facilitate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is also equally important to maintain services for the major infectious diseases in the region, such as tuberculosis and malaria. A breakdown of treatment and prevention services for these conditions may even overshadow the projected morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
7652,Clinical evaluation of the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 and detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"We evaluated the performance of the BioFire® Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) in the detection of SARS CoV-2 in comparison against three other SARS CoV-2 EUA assays. In these studies, the RP2.1 panel had 98 % positive percent agreement (48/49) and 100 % negative percent agreement (49/49). Since 30 % of nasopharyngeal swab specimens have a SARS CoV-2 Ct >30 and thus detection of virus in low titers is clinically relevant, a sample with a high titer was diluted and each 10 fold dilution was tested in triplicate and compared against 6 other EUA approved SARS CoV-2 assays. These data suggested that the BioFire® RP2.1 panel, along with four other SARS CoV-2 assays (Roche cobas, Cepheid Xpert Xpress, BioFire® Defense COVID19, and NECoV19), consistently detected viral RNA at the 10-7 dilution. Overall, these studies suggest that the BioFire® RP2.1 assay can be used to detect acute cases of SARS CoV2 in addition to patients with low viral titer later in disease presentation."
7653,Perinatal Transmission of 2019 Coronavirus Disease-Associated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: Should We Worry?,We present 2 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the third trimester of pregnancy. Both mothers and newborns had excellent outcomes. We failed to identify SARS-CoV-2 in all of the products of conception and the newborns. This report provided evidence of low risk of intrauterine infection by vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
7654,A descriptive analysis of clinical characteristics of COVID-19 among healthcare workers in a district specialist hospital.,"Introduction: COVID-19 is a highly transmissible respiratory virus that has affected millions of people worldwide in the span of months. The burden of disease among healthcare workers (HCW) has not been well studied despite reports of infectivity and transmission around the world. Two HCW in Hospital Teluk Intan (HTI) contracted COVID-19 while attending a social event. They were in close proximity with colleagues upon returning to work, resulting in the spread of infection among other HCW in HTI. Objective: The objectives of this paper are to gain a better understanding of the key presenting symptoms of COVID-19 in HCWs in a district specialist hospital, to establish the proportion of symptomatic COVID-19 cases among HCWs and its severity and to determine the time taken from onset of symptoms or perceived exposure to diagnostic testing. Methodology: This is a retrospective descriptive analysis of clinical characteristics of subjects infected with COVID-19 among HCW in HTI. Their demography and clinical characteristics were recorded. Results: There were 47 HCW in HTI who tested positive for COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 37.5 years old. 7 patients (15.2%) had at least more than one comorbidity. Average duration of time from perceived close contact to onset of symptom was 4.5 days, while the mean duration of time from symptoms to first positive RT-PCR result was 3.4 days. Six patients (13.0%) were asymptomatic throughout, whereas 40 (87.0%) had at least one symptom prior to hospitalization. The most commonly reported symptoms were fever (65.2%), sore throat (39.1%) and cough (37.0%). In terms of severity of symptoms, the majority of patients experienced mild symptoms (Group 2, 52.2%). Two patients (4.3%) with multiple comorbidities had severe disease requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. There were no mortalities, and the longest staying patient was hospitalized for 18 days. The high rates of infectivity among HCW in HTI can be attributed to working in close proximity while in the asymptomatic incubation phase, while no HCW directly involved in the care of COVID-19 positive patients were tested positive. Conclusion: We report that HCW share similar clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection as those of non HCW patients in earlier studies. The infection can spread rapidly within healthcare settings via close contacts among infected HCWs. As such, we advocate distancing when working and usage of personal protective equipment when treating patients with respiratory illness to reduce transmission of COVID-19."
7655,A potential antiviral activity of Esculentoside A against binding interactions of SARS-COV-2 spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).,"The recent emergence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a devastating pandemic with global concern. However, to date, there are no regimens to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is an urgent need to identify novel leads with anti-viral properties that impede viral pathogenesis in the host system. Esculentoside A (EsA), a saponin isolated from the root of Phytolacca esculenta, is known to exhibit diverse pharmacological properties, especially anti-inflammatory activity. To our knowledge, SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter host cells. This is mediated through the proteins of SARS-CoV-2, especially the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain. Thus, our primary goal is to prevent virus replication and binding to the host, which allows us to explore the efficiency of EsA on key surface drug target proteins using the computational biology paradigm approach. Here, the anti-coronavirus activity of EsA in vitro and its potential mode of inhibitory action on the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were investigated. We found that EsA inhibited the HCoV-OC43 coronavirus during the attachment and penetration stage. Molecular docking results showed that EsA had a strong binding affinity with the spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2. The results of the molecular dynamics simulation revealed that EsA had higher stable binding with the spike protein. These results demonstrated that Esculentoside A can act as a spike protein blocker to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Considering the poor bioavailability and low toxicity of EsA, it is suitable as novel lead for the inhibitor against binding interactions of SARS-CoV-2 of S-protein and ACE2."
7656,The Course of SARS-CoV-2 in a Patient After a Recent Kidney Transplant: A Literature Review on COVID-19 Therapy.,"Background: Kidney transplant recipients are at high risk of severe complications and death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: The first part of the article describes a case of COVID-19 in our patient after a recent kidney transplant. The second part of the article presents the outcome of literature search from multiple resources from April 2020 until March 2021. Abstracts were screened, followed by full-text review with data extraction. Part 2 discusses current treatment options of COVID-19, and part 3 refers to this treatment application in patients after solid organ transplant. Results: We have summarized 45 studies from China, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Mortality rates from published studies were variable. Based on early data from Spain, 42% of patients who developed COVID-19 within 60 days of transplant died. According to results of the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database collaboration group, the 28-day COVID-19-related mortality is 21.3% for kidney transplant recipients, which is still markedly higher than what is observed in other populations. Acute kidney injury was common, and mycophenolate mofetil and mammalian target of rapamycin were discontinued in most patients. Conclusions: Effective therapy has been sought since the outbreak of the pandemic, and at the same time intensive work has been done to produce a vaccine that could effectively protect against the disease. Summing up the efforts of numerous groups of researchers from around the world that have been continued since the beginning of 2020, we may assume the following: (1) we still do not have causal drugs that would reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and allow its complete elimination, but antispike monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 seem to be very promising, and (2) the withdrawal of antiproliferative and antimetabolic drugs and the continuation of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors is now a commonly accepted approach in patients after organ transplant."

7658,Clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosed in a primary care practice in Madrid (Spain).,"Background: Possible cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were diagnosed in primary care in Madrid, some of these cases had pneumonia. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia published data came from hospitalised patients. This study set out to describe clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosed in primary care across age groups and type of pneumonia. Methods: Observational retrospective study obtaining clinical data from the electronic health records of patients who were followed-up by SARS-CoV-2 possible infection in a primary care practice in Madrid. All the cases were collected by in-person or remote consultation during the 10th March to the 7th of April. Exposure: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by chest X-ray ordered by the GP. Main outcomes and measures: Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, physical examination and diagnostic tests as a blood test, nasopharyngeal swab results for RT-PCR (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) and chest X-ray results. Results: The overall SARS-CoV-2 pneumonias collected were 172 (female 87 [50.6%], mean age 60.5 years standard deviation [SD] 17.0). Comorbidities were body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 (90 [52.3%]), hypertension (83 [48.3%]), dyslipidaemia (68 [39.5%]) and diabetes (33 [19.2%]). The sample was stratified by age groups (< 50 years, 50-75 years and ≥ 75 years). Clinical manifestations at onset were fever (144 [83.7%]), cough (140 [81.4%]), dyspnoea (103 [59.9%]) and gastrointestinal disturbances (72 [41.9%]). Day 7.8 (SD:4.1) from clinical onset was the mean day of pneumonia diagnosis. Bilateral pneumonia was more prevalent than unilateral (126 [73.3%] and 46 [26.7%]). Patients with unilateral pneumonia were prone to higher pulse oximetry (96% vs 94%, p < 0.001). We found differences between unilateral and bilateral cases in C-reactive protein (29.6 vs 81.5 mg/L, p < 0.001), and lymphocytes (1400.0 vs 1000.0E3/ml, p < 0.001). Complications were registered: 42 (100%) of patients ≥ 75 years were admitted into hospital; pulmonary embolism was only present at bilateral pneumonia (7 patients [5.6%]) and death occurred in 1 patient with unilateral pneumonia (2.2%) vs 10 patients (7.9%) with bilateral pneumonia ( p 0.170). Conclusion: Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were fever, cough and dyspnoea; this was especially clear in the elderly. We described different characteristics between unilateral and bilateral pneumonia."
