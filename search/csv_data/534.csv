5330,Ten tips for improving your clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Purpose of review: This review provides ten tips for improving clinical practice during COVID-19 as pandemic fatigue begins to complicate personal and professional lives of clinicians. Recent findings: COVID-19 has created unique and unexpected challenges to healthcare delivery, but has also provided opportunities for re-evaluation of practice patterns to optimize high-value practices. With ongoing uncertainty, key factors to appreciate for patient and population health include the continued touchstones of empathy and compassion, the use of effective risk communication with shared clinical decision-making when appropriate, attention to resource stewardship and vulnerable populations, importance of health literacy and need for critical assessment of media and medical literature to mitigate misinformation, and the hidden costs of the pandemic on children. Although there has been some international concern for allergic reactions to the recently approved Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, neither the United States Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations exclude patients without a specific allergy to a vaccine component from receiving vaccination. Summary: Practical adjustments to practice during COVID-19 are feasible and acceptable. Experience during COVID-19 reinforces the critical need for human connection while providing care and service in every encounter."
5331,A modified age-structured SIR model for COVID-19 type viruses.,"We present a modified age-structured SIR model based on known patterns of social contact and distancing measures within Washington, USA. We find that population age-distribution has a significant effect on disease spread and mortality rate, and contribute to the efficacy of age-specific contact and treatment measures. We consider the effect of relaxing restrictions across less vulnerable age-brackets, comparing results across selected groups of varying population parameters. Moreover, we analyze the mitigating effects of vaccinations and examine the effectiveness of age-targeted distributions. Lastly, we explore how our model can applied to other states to reflect social-distancing policy based on different parameters and metrics."
5332,"The central role of the nasal microenvironment in the transmission, modulation, and clinical progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 enters into the human body mainly through the ACE2 + TMPRSS2+ nasal epithelial cells. The initial host response to this pathogen occurs in a peculiar immune microenvironment that, starting from the Nasopharynx-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (NALT) system, is the product of a long evolutionary process that is aimed to first recognize exogenous airborne agents. In the present work, we want to critically review the latest molecular and cellular findings on the mucosal response to SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal cavity and in NALT, and to analyze its impact in the subsequent course of COVID-19. Finally, we want to explore the possibility that the regulation of the systemic inflammatory network against the virus can be modulated starting from the initial phases of the nasal and nasopharyngeal response and this may have several clinical and epidemiological implications starting from a mucosal vaccine development."
5333,"COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 3 (Reporting week ending 19:00 AEDT 15 February 2020).","This is the third epidemiological report for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), previously known as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), from the virus now known as SARS-CoV-2, reported in Australia as at 19:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Time [AEDT] 15 February 2020. It includes data on the COVID-19 Australian cases, the international situation and current information on the severity, transmission and spread."
5334,Frequency and Duration of SARS-CoV-2 Shedding in Oral Fluid Samples Assessed by a Modified Commercial Rapid Molecular Assay.,"Background: RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal (NPS)/oropharyngeal swabs is the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral load monitoring. Oral fluid (OF) is an alternate clinical sample, easy and safer to collect and could be useful for COVID-19 diagnosis, monitoring viral load and shedding. Methods: Optimal assay conditions and analytical sensitivity were established for the commercial Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay adapted to OF matrix. The assay was used to test 337 OF and NPS specimens collected in parallel from 164 hospitalized patients; 50 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from a subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases were also analysed. Results: Using Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct on OF matrix, 100% analytical detection down to 1 TCID50/mL (corresponding to 4 × 103 copies (cp)/mL) was observed. No crossreaction with other viruses transmitted through the respiratory toute was observed. Parallel testing of 337 OF and NPS samples showed highly concordant results (κ = 0.831; 95 % CI = 0.771-0.891), and high correlation of Ct values (r = 0.921; p < 0.0001). High concordance and elevated correlation was observed also between OF and BAL. Prolonged viral RNA shedding was observed up to 100 days from symptoms onset (DSO), with 32% and 29% positivity observed in OF and NPS samples, respectively, collected between 60 and 100 DSO. Conclusions: Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assays on OF have high sensitivity and specificity to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and provide an alternative to NPS for diagnosis and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 shedding."

5336,The toll of COVID-19 on African children: A descriptive analysis on COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among the pediatric population in Sub-Saharan Africa.,"Introduction: Few data on the COVID-19 epidemiological characteristics among the pediatric population in Africa exists. This paper examines the age and sex distribution of the morbidity and mortality rate in children with COVID-19 and compares it to the adult population in 15 Sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: A merge line listing dataset shared by countries within the Regional Office for Africa was analyzed. Patients diagnosed within 1 March and 1 September 2020 with a confirmed positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. Children's data were stratified into three age groups: 0-4 years, 5-11 years, and 12-17 years, while adults were combined. The cumulative incidence of cases, its medians, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: 9% of the total confirmed cases and 2.4% of the reported deaths were pediatric cases. The 12-17 age group in all 15 countries showed the highest cumulative incidence proportion in children. Adults had a higher case incidence per 100,000 people than children. Conclusion: The cases and deaths within the children's population were smaller than the adult population. These differences may reflect biases in COVID-19 testing protocols and reporting implemented by countries, highlighting the need for more extensive investigation and focus on the effects of COVID-19 in children."
5337,SARS-CoV-2: a new dimension to our understanding of coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses have marked their significant emergence since the twenty-first century with the outbreaks of three out of the seven existing human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. These viruses have not only acquired large-scale transmission during their specified outbreak period, but cases of MERS-CoV still remain active, although there is only limited transmission. While, on the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 continues to remain a rising threat to global public health. The recent novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged during December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has repeatedly raised questions about its characteristic variability. Despite belonging to the same family, SARS-CoV-2 has proven to be quite difficult to control and contain in terms of transmissibility, leading to around 19.8 million reported cases and more than 730,000 deaths of individuals worldwide. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 differs from its two other related human coronaviruses in terms of genome composition, site of infection, and transmissibility, among several other notable aspects-all indicating to the possibility that it is these variations in addition to other unknowns that are contributing to this virus' differing deadly pattern."
5338,COVID-19 vaccine-associated immune thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (VITT): Diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for a new syndrome.,"Very rare cases of thrombosis associated with thrombocytopenia have occurred following the vaccination with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The aim of this concise review is to summarize the current knowledge on the epidemiologic and pathogenic mechanisms of this syndrome named vaccine-associated immune thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (VITT). A practical patient management section will also be dealt with using information available from national and international scientific societies as well as expert panels. A literature search on the VITT syndrome was carried out in PubMed using appropriate MeSH headings. Overall, 40 VITT cases have been reported. Continuous pharmacovigilance monitoring is needed to collect more data on the real incidence and the pathogenesis of VITT syndrome. Such information will also help us to optimize the management this rare but often clinically severe thrombotic condition associated with COVID-19 vaccination."
5339,External validity of phase III trials on vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to a middle-aged and elderly Western European population.,"Initial results from various phase-III trials on vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are promising. For proper translation of these results to clinical guidelines, it is essential to determine how well the general population is reflected in the study populations of these trials. This study was conducted among 7162 participants (age-range: 51-106 years; 58% women) from the Rotterdam Study. We quantified the proportion of participants that would be eligible for the nine ongoing phase-III trials. We further quantified the eligibility among participants at high risk to develop severe COVID-19. Since many trials were not explicit in their exclusion criterion with respect to 'acute' or 'unstable preexisting' diseases, we performed two analyses. First, we included all participants irrespective of this criterion. Second, we excluded persons with acute or 'unstable preexisting' diseases. 97% of 7162 participants was eligible for any trial with eligibility for separate trials ranging between 11-97%. For high-risk individuals the corresponding numbers were 96% for any trial with separate trials ranging from 5-96%. Importantly, considering persons ineligible due to 'acute' or 'unstable pre-existing' disease drastically dropped the eligibilities for all trials below 43% for the total population and below 36% for high-risk individuals. The eligibility for ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce by half depending on interpretation and application of a single unspecified exclusion criterion. This exclusion criterion in our study would especially affect the elderly and those with pre-existing morbidities. These findings thus indicate the difficulty as well as importance of developing clinical recommendations for vaccination and applying these to the appropriate target populations. This becomes especially paramount considering the fact that many countries worldwide have initiated their vaccination programs by first targeting the elderly and most vulnerable persons."
