570,"Molecular Mirror Technology Facilitates High-Throughput, Accurate SARS-CoV-2 Testing.","Tests to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are at the center of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid tests benefit from providing quick results but suffer from lower sensitivity, while PCR tests usually take longer to provide more reliable results and can be difficult to scale to meet population needs. We evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of a Molecular Mirror assay (MMA) using nucleic acid extraction and a nucleic acid extraction-free method to determine its ability to identify SARS-CoV-2 in nasal specimens from individuals suspected of having SARS-CoV-2. We compared the MMA using nucleic acid extraction to the emergency use authorization (EUA)-approved TaqPath reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay to determine its performance characteristics. From 412 total specimens (including 115 previous positives and 297 previous negatives), we found that the positive percent agreement (PPA) was 99.1% (confidence interval [CI], 97.4% to 100.0%) and the negative percent agreement (NPA) was 99.3% (95% CI, 98.4% to 100.0%) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Using the extraction-free method, we analyzed 109 specimens (51 previous positives and 58 previous negatives) and found that the PPA for the more rapid version of the assay was 87.8% (95% CI, 78.5% to 96.9%) and the NPA was 100.0% (95% CI, 100.0%) for virus detection. The extraction method has performance comparable to what is observed in many PCR-based assays. The extraction-free method has lower PPA but has the advantage of being more rapid and having a higher throughput. Our data offer a proof of concept that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection can be used in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing and may allow for alternative supply chains to increase testing options. IMPORTANCE Accurate diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infections have been critical for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both high-sensitivity/specificity PCR-based tests and lower-sensitivity/specificity rapid antigen assays have been the subject of worldwide supply chain limitations as individual facilities and countries have struggled to meet their population testing needs. We evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of a Molecular Mirror assay (MMA), which uses nuclear magnetic resonance to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids both with and without full nucleic acid extractions. We found that compared to a U.S. emergency use authorization (EUA) approved assay (TaqPath) that uses reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), the MMA had high PPA and NPA with full nucleic acid extractions, and acceptable positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with an extraction-free protocol. In a landscape marred by supply chain shortages across the world, altered SARS-CoV-2 detection methods such as the MMA can add to testing supplies while providing quality SARS-CoV-2 testing results."
571,A single center cohort of 40 severe COVID-19 patients who were treated with convalescent plasma.,"Background/aim: A SARS-Cov2 infection which was first arised from Wuhan in December 2019 and named as COVID-19. Still there lacks either a specific treatment or a vaccine to treat COVID-19. Convalescent plasma (CP) was previously used successfully to treat SARS-CoV-1 and MERS infections. Health authority in Turkey has published a guideline to integrate this promising option in the treatment process of patients who are prone to high risk of developing severe COVID 19. Materials and methods: Forty consecutive patients who had received CP at our center were included in the study. Demographics, COVID-19 specific parameters, biomarkers to detect the severity of COVID-19 infection and outcome variables were collected retrospectively. The correlation between outcome variables and the independent predictors of the outcome were reported. Results: Median age of the patients was 57.5 and 72.5% were male. At least one COVID-19 PCR test was confirmed to be positive in 75% of patients. Remaining 25% had a Chest-CT which was reported to be compatible with an ongoing COVID-19. All patients (100%) were classified as having severe COVID-19 infection. Over a half of the patients harbored an oxygen saturation of less than 90 despite of a continuous 5 L/min support of O2. 82.5% of the patients had a need for mechanical ventilation and 45.5% had a need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Nine out of 10 patients who have received CP outside ICU have totally recovered from COVID-19 at a median of 9 days, and a half of the patients who needed invasive mechanical ventilation were successfully free of mechanical ventilation support and managed to recover from COVID-19. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, CP is an efficient conjunct to conventional therapy against COVID-19 with a favorable safety profile."

573,"Sensitive and Specific Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Using a High-Throughput, Fully Automated Liquid-Handling Robotic System.","As of July 22, 2020, more than 14.7 million infections of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), have been confirmed globally. Serological assays are essential for community screening, assessing infection prevalence, aiding identification of infected patients, and enacting appropriate treatment and quarantine protocols in the battle against this rapidly expanding pandemic. Antibody detection by agglutination-PCR (ADAP) is a pure solution phase immunoassay that generates a PCR amplifiable signal when patient antibodies agglutinate DNA-barcoded antigen probes into a dense immune complex. Here, we present an ultrasensitive and high-throughput automated liquid biopsy assay based on the Hamilton Microlab ADAP STAR automated liquid-handling platform, which was developed and validated for the qualitative detection of total antibodies against spike protein 1 (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 that uses as little as 4 ÂµL of serum. To assess the clinical performance of the ADAP assay, 57 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 223 control patients were tested. The assay showed a sensitivity of 98% (56/57) and a specificity of 99.55% (222/223). Notably, the SARS-CoV-2-negative control patients included individuals with other common coronaviral infections, such as CoV-NL63 and CoV-HKU, which did not cross-react. In addition to high performance, the hands-free automated workstation enabled high-throughput sample processing to reduce screening workload while helping to minimize analyst contact with biohazardous samples. Therefore, the ADAP STAR liquid-handling workstation can be used as a valuable tool to address the COVID-19 global pandemic."
574,Five Antigen Tests for SARS-CoV-2: Virus Viability Matters.,"Antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 (AGT) is generally considered inferior to RT-PCR testing in terms of sensitivity. However, little is known about the infectiousness of RT-PCR positive patients who pass undetected by AGT. In a screening setting for mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with high COVID-19 prevalence (30-40%), 1141 patients were tested using one of five AGTs and RT-PCR. Where the results differed, virus viability in the samples was tested on cell culture (CV-1 cells). The test battery included AGTs by JOYSBIO, Assure Tech, SD Biosensor, VivaChek Biotech and NDFOS. Sensitivities of the ATGs compared to RT-PCR ranged from 42% to 76%. The best test yielded a 76% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 89% negative predictive values, respectively. However, in the best performing ATG tests, almost 90% of samples with ""false negative"" AGT results contained no viable virus. Corrected on the virus viability, sensitivities grew to 81-97% and, with one exception, the tests yielded high specificities >96%. Performance characteristics of the best test after adjustment were 96% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 99% negative predictive values (high prevalence population). We, therefore, believe that virus viability should be considered when assessing the AGT performance. Also, our results indicate that a well-performing antigen test could in a high-prevalence setting serve as an excellent tool for identifying patients shedding viable virus. We also propose that the high proportion of RT-PCR-positive samples containing no viable virus in the group of ""false negatives"" of the antigen test should be further investigated with the aim of possibly preventing needless isolation of such patients."
575,Comprehensive evaluation of eight commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays.,"Sensitivity and specificity of serological assays are key parameters for the accurate estimation of SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence. The aim of this study was to compare 8 readily available IgG antibody tests using a panel of well-defined serum samples of prepandemic and pandemic origin. A cross-reaction panel included samples of patients with recent infection with either of the endemic Coronaviruses 229E, NL63, HKU1, or OC43. Additionally, samples with high antibody levels against influenza virus, adenovirus, and during acute EBV infection were included. Previous infection with endemic coronaviruses caused a significant amount of cross-reactivity in two of the assays. In contrast, the confidence intervals for the assays of Abbott, DiaSorin, Euroimmun and Roche encompassed the value of 98% for samples with a previous endemic HCoV infection. For all assays, sensitivities were between 91.3% and 98.8%. Assay performance was independent of the usage of either nucleocapsid or spike proteins."
576,Clinical Manifestations and Characterization of COVID-19 in Liver Transplant Recipients: A Systematic Review of Case Reports and Case Series.,"Background: This systematic review is conducted to explore available information on clinical presentations, laboratory finding and outcomes of SARS-COV-2 in liver transplant patients. Methods: We searched four databases for relevant terms related to COVID-19 and liver transplantation and collected both case reports and case series on liver transplantation published up to the end of September 2020. Results: After initial screening of irrelevant articles, 25 studies were included and analyzed in this review. Among the 59 patients included, 78.3% were over 50 years old, and 71.6% were males. The majority of patients (93.3%) were hospitalized. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (72.9%) followed by dyspnea and cough (54.2%). The majority of patients revealed a high level of CRP (64.3%). Moreover, high level ALT, AST and ALP were reported in 64.3, 37.5, 30.5 and 22.2% of patients. A total, 9(15.3%), of cases died as a result of complications of COVID-19. Chest radiographs were reported in 72.9%(43/59) of cases that 94% demonstrated radiologic evidence of abnormality. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that the most prevalent symptoms and signs were fever, dyspnea and cough. Moreover, most patients were males and hospitalized. The rate of mortality and high level of CRP, ALT/AST and ALP is similar within the non-immune suppressed and general population. However, early detection of high level of serum CRP, ALT/AST and ALP combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom and finding of CT scan may be used as an index for the presence and severity of the disease."

579,Efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 Covid-19 Vaccine against the B.1.351 Variant.,"Background: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants threatens progress toward control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. In a phase 1-2 trial involving healthy adults, the NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and was associated with strong neutralizing-antibody and antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses. Evaluation of vaccine efficacy was needed in a setting of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methods: In this phase 2a-b trial in South Africa, we randomly assigned human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years or medically stable HIV-positive participants between the ages of 18 and 64 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (5 Î¼g of recombinant spike protein with 50 Î¼g of Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary end points were safety and vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 at 7 days or more after the second dose among participants without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Of 6324 participants who underwent screening, 4387 received at least one injection of vaccine or placebo. Approximately 30% of the participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative and 6% HIV-positive), predominantly mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 15 participants in the vaccine group and in 29 in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 49.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1 to 72.8). Vaccine efficacy among HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI, 19.9 to 80.1). Of 41 sequenced isolates, 38 (92.7%) were the B.1.351 variant. Post hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI, -0.6 to 76.2) among the HIV-negative participants. Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity events were more common in the vaccine group; serious adverse events were rare in both groups. Conclusions: The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, with higher vaccine efficacy observed among HIV-negative participants. Most infections were caused by the B.1.351 variant.
