6370,Induction of SARS-CoV-2 Protein S-Specific CD8+ T Cells in the Lungs of gp96-Ig-S Vaccinated Mice.,"Given the aggressive spread of COVID-19-related deaths, there is an urgent public health need to support the development of vaccine candidates to rapidly improve the available control measures against SARS-CoV-2. To meet this need, we are leveraging our existing vaccine platform to target SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated cellular heat shock chaperone protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), to deliver SARS-CoV-2 protein S (spike) to the immune system and to induce cell-mediated immune responses. We showed that our vaccine platform effectively stimulates a robust cellular immune response against protein S. Moreover, we confirmed that gp96-Ig, secreted from allogeneic cells expressing full-length protein S, generates powerful, protein S polyepitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lung interstitium and airways. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that protein-S -specific CD8+ T cells were induced in human leukocyte antigen HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice thus providing encouraging translational data that the vaccine is likely to work in humans, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation."

6372,"Single- and Two-Stage, Closed-Tube, Point-of-Care, Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Short of a vaccine, frequent and rapid testing, preferably at home, is the most effective strategy to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we report on single-stage and two-stage molecular diagnostic tests that can be carried out with simple or no instrumentation. Our single-stage amplification is reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with custom-designed primers targeting the ORF1ab and the N gene regions of the virus genome. Our new two-stage amplification, dubbed Penn-RAMP, comprises recombinase isothermal amplification (RT-RPA) as its first stage and LAMP as its second stage. We compared various sample preparation strategies aimed at deactivating the virus while preserving its RNA and tested contrived and patient samples, consisting of nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and saliva. Amplicons were detected either in real time with fluorescent intercalating dye or after amplification with the intercalating colorimetric dye LCV, which is insensitive to sample's PH. Our single RT-LAMP tests can be carried out instrumentation-free. To enable concurrent testing of multiple samples, we developed an inexpensive heat block that supports both the single-stage and two-stage amplification. Our RT-LAMP and Penn-RAMP assays have, respectively, analytical sensitivities of 50 and 5 virions/reaction. Both our single- and two-stage assays have successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in patients with viral loads corresponding to the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) threshold cycle smaller than 32 while operating with minimally processed samples, without nucleic acid isolation. Penn-RAMP provides a 10-fold better sensitivity than RT-LAMP and does not need thermal cycling like PCR assays. All reagents are amenable to dry, refrigeration-free storage. The SARS-CoV-2 test described herein is suitable for screening at home, at the point of need, and in resource-poor settings."

6374,Inadequate deltoid muscle penetration and concerns of improper COVID mRNA vaccine administration can be avoided by injection technique modification.,"Background: Recent phase-3 clinical trials have demonstrated very encouraging results for mRNA based vaccines against COVID-19. Current FDA and manufacturer guidelines mandate intramuscular administration of these vaccines, as other administration routes may not provide the same levels of effectiveness and safety. Observing the vast amount of published media images of persons receiving their vaccines, the authors noted in many cases the injection technique involved skin bunching, raising concerns of inadequate deltoid muscle penetration and consequent lowered vaccine efficacy. Our study hypothesis was that skin bunching will increase the skin-to-muscle distance over 20 mm, the maximal distance allowing the required 5 mm muscle penetration with a 25 mm needle. Materials and methods: 60 adult volunteers from our hospital staff were recruited, and using ultrasound, the skin-to-muscle distance measured in three positions: flat, skin bunching and muscle bunching. The skin-to-muscle distance difference and correlation with gender and BMI were calculated. Results: Skin bunching significantly increased the skin-to-muscle distance in all subjects. In 6 (10%) subjects, this increase exceeded the 20 mm limit. Having a skin-to-deltoid distance of 20 mm or more strongly correlated with a BMI of 30 or more. Conclusions: Skin bunching will prevent adequate intramuscular injection of vaccines in a small percentage of persons, but as hundreds of millions are expected to receive mRNA vaccines in the coming months, the multiplied result can have significant personal and societal consequences for millions of people globally, especially in obese populations, and therefore this practice should be strictly discouraged."
6375,COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality Among Long-Term Care Facility Residents and Staff in South Carolina.,"Objectives: This study explored differences in COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and timing among long-term care facility (LTCF) residents and staff with those living in the community in South Carolina (SC). Design: Longitudinal secondary data analysis. Setting and participants: Adults age â‰¥18 in SC with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from 3/15/2020 and 1/2/2021 (n = 307,891). Methods: COVID-19 data came from the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC). We included all COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among adult residents. Residence and employment in LTCF were confirmed by SCDHEC. Descriptive statistics and trends for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were calculated. We used Cox proportional hazards to compare COVID-19 mortality in LTCF residents and staff to community dwelling older adults and adults not employed in LTCF, respectively, controlling for age, gender, race, and pre-existing chronic health conditions. Results: LTC residents experienced greater incidence of cases throughout the study period until the week ending on 1/2/21. LTCF residents with COVID-19 were more likely to be hospitalized compared to older adults in the community and 74% more likely to die (HR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.59-1.90), after adjusting. LTC staff experienced greater incidence of cases compared to adults not employed in LTCF until the week ending on 12/26/2020, while experiencing similar incidence of death compared to the similar community members. After adjusting, LTC staff had 0.58 (HR = 0.58; CI: 0.39-0.88) times lower hazard of death compared to community members that did not work in a LTCF. Conclusions and implications: Narrowing of the gap between LTCF and community-wide infection and mortality rates over the study period suggests that early detection of COVID-19 in LTCFs could serve as a first indicator of disease spread in the greater community. Results also indicate that policies and regulations addressing staff testing and protection may help to slow or prevent spread within facilities."
6376,Intention to Receive COVID-19 Vaccine by U.S. Health Sciences University Employees.,"Objectives: Understanding vaccine intentions and attitudes of health professionals is critical as the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID19 vaccines are being administered throughout the United States. This study estimates the level of vaccine hesitancy at a health sciences center in West Texas prior to the distribution of the vaccines. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed via anonymous Qualtrics survey administered to approximately 4500 faculty, staff, postdoctoral research associates/medical residents, and employees at a multi-campus health sciences university in the United States. Respondents were asked demographic questions and intention to receive the vaccine. Factors associated with the intention to receive a vaccine were determined using logistic regression analysis. Results: A total sample of 2258 subjects were evaluated (50.0% response rate). Among all respondents, 64.6% reported that they would probably or definitely receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Men had higher levels of intention to receive the vaccine (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.64-2.71); respondents who indicated yearly influenza vaccines are necessary were also more likely to receive the vaccine (OR = 6.04, 95% CI 4.70-7.75). Eighty-three percent of faculty and 56% of the staff reported intention to receive the vaccine. Respondents who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 reported more interest in receiving the vaccine (58.5% yes vs 41.5% no). Conclusion: In this study, the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccination at a United States health sciences center falls below the necessary herd immunity estimates. Public health initiatives must be developed to decrease vaccine hesitancy, especially among health professionals."

6378,Prevention of COVID-19 infection in a pediatric oncology ward in Wuhan.,"Objective: To assess the screening and isolation measures for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection from newly admitted patients into a pediatric oncology ward. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients with established hematologic malignancies admitted for chemotherapy from January 23 to March 27, 2020 in the Department of Pediatric Hematology of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Every patient and their caregivers were well educated on personal protection and put it into effect at home and in hospital. Screening for COVID-19 of all the patients and caregivers before admission was performed. Both clinical features and screening results including chest computerized tomography (CT); nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or anal swabs; and quantitative antibodies (IgM and IgG) detecting of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of these patients were described. Results: The results of nucleic acid and antibodies (IgM and IgG) testing of all the 44 inpatients and their caregivers were negative. Abnormal chest CT images were observed in six symptomatic patients, while chest CT images of their caregivers did not show the changes related to viral pneumonia. These symptomatic patients all recovered after antibacterial combined with antifungal treatment, but without any antiviral agents. Conclusions: COVID-19 infection could be prevented in pediatric patients with malignancies if proper protective measures were implemented. For patients presenting suspicious symptoms, comprehensive examinations should be carried out."
6379,COVID-19: Coronavirus Vaccine Development Updates.,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly emerged coronavirus, and has been pandemic since March 2020 and led to many fatalities. Vaccines represent the most efficient means to control and stop the pandemic of COVID-19. However, currently there is no effective COVID-19 vaccine approved to use worldwide except for two human adenovirus vector vaccines, three inactivated vaccines, and one peptide vaccine for early or limited use in China and Russia. Safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 are in urgent need. Researchers around the world are developing 213 COVID-19 candidate vaccines, among which 44 are in human trials. In this review, we summarize and analyze vaccine progress against SARS-CoV, Middle-East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, including inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines, virus like particles, nucleic acid vaccines, and viral vector vaccines. As SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV share the common genus, Betacoronavirus, this review of the major research progress will provide a reference and new insights into the COVID-19 vaccine design and development."
