620,Seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among healthcare workers with differing levels of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient exposure.,"Healthcare employees were tested for antibodies against severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among 734 employees, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.6%. Employees with heavy coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure had similar antibody prevalence as those with limited or no exposure. Guidelines for PPE use seem effective for preventing COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers."
621,"The importance of anosmia, ageusia and age in community presentation of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Louisiana, USA; a cross-sectional prevalence study.","Objective: While many seroprevalence studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been performed, few are demographically representative. This investigation focused on defining the nature and frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a representative, cross-sectional sample of communities in Louisiana, USA. Methods: A sample of 4778 adults from New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana were given a survey of symptoms and co-morbidities, nasopharyngeal swab to test for active infection (PCR), and blood draw to test for past infection (IgG). Odds ratios, cluster analysis, quantification of virus and antibody, and linear modelling were used to understand whether certain symptoms were associated with a positive test, how symptoms grouped together, whether virus or antibody varied by symptom status, and whether being symptomatic was different across the age span. Results: Reported anosmia/ageusia was strongly associated with a positive test; 40.6% (93/229) tested positive versus 4.8% (218/4549) positivity in those who did not report anosmia/ageusia (OR 13.6, 95% CI 10.1-18.3). Of the people who tested positive, 47.3% (147/311) were completely asymptomatic. Symptom presentation clustered into three groups; low/no symptoms (0.4 ± 0.9, mean ± SD), highly symptomatic (7.5 ± 1.9) or moderately symptomatic (4.0 ± 1.5). Quantity of virus was lower in the asymptomatic versus symptomatic group (cycle number 23.3 ± 8.3 versus 17.3 ± 9.0; p < 0.001). Modelling the probability of symptoms showed changes with age; the highest probability of reporting symptoms was 64.6% (95% CI 50.4-76.5) at age 29 years, which decreased to a probability of 49.3% (95% CI 36.6-62.0) at age 60 years and only 25.1% (95% CI 5.0-68.1) at age 80 years. Conclusion: Anosmia/ageusia can be used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection from other illnesses, and, given the high ratio of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing should include those without symptoms. Regular testing in congregant settings of those over age 60 years may help mitigate asymptomatic spread."
622,Current advances in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a global pandemic that has wreaked havoc globally, which has put a heavy toll on public health, lives, and the world economy. Vaccination is considered as one of the greatest successes in medical history. Based on prior experience with the development of SARS-CoV vaccines, all COVID-19 vaccines must be subjected to the tests for protective effects and harmful risks derived from antibody-dependent enhancement that may contribute to augmented infectivity and/or eosinophilic infiltration. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is now being developed urgently in several different ways. China is regarded as one of the world's leading countries in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, up to date the last inactivated vaccine international clinical (Phase III) trial was launched in the United Arab Emirates by Sinopharm China National Biotec Group (CNBG). In this review, we outline the current status of vaccine development against clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 strains, anticipating that such attempts would help create efficacious and sage SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."

624,Effects of SARS-CoV-2 variants on vaccine efficacy and response strategies.,"Introduction: As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to spread, several variants have emerged. Variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have attracted significant attention owing to their widespread transmission and possible immune evasion. A total of 19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on original strains have entered clinical studies, including nine vaccines that have obtained emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations. However, newly emerging variants may affect their protective efficacy. Decreased efficacy of the Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca vaccines against B.1.351 has been reported. The spread of variants creates a tremendous challenge for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic via vaccination. Several response strategies, including accelerating massive rollouts of current vaccines, increasing vaccine immunogenicity by increasing vaccination doses, and accelerating next-generation vaccines against variants, have been suggested. Areas covered: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy against variants and response strategies for emerging variants. Expert opinion: Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines authorized for emergency use or under clinical trials have shown certain advantages in providing adequate protection against new variants. We analyzed the effects of reported variants on neutralizing antibodies and the protective efficacy of different vaccines and propose strategies for applying current vaccines against variants and developing next-generation vaccines."
625,Development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed significant challenges globally. Continuous transmission of the virus is mostly due to insufficient infection control measures and a lack of vaccines. Therefore, this review aimed to identify and describe possible vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Methods: A systematic review of the scientific literature was performed through electronic searches of the main databases to identify published reports or studies on vaccines under development against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Websites from international organizations, institutes of health and research, Google, and references from identified studies were also reviewed. Studies examining the mechanisms of infection, immunopathology, and genomics were excluded. Results: A total of 141 vaccines in development against SARS-CoV-2 were identified. The technologies used include weakened and inactive viruses, viral vectors, nucleic acids, and proteins. So far, 13 vaccines (9.2%) are under clinical evaluation; only the AZD1222 vaccine is under clinical evaluation Phase II-III. Ad5-nCoV and mRNA-1273 vaccines showed to produce neutralizing antibodies and also to be safe. Conclusions: Despite efforts invested in developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, more research is still required. The vaccine developers, international health organizations, and the decision-makers of health policies must carry out conjunct cooperation to face the different challenges and guarantee the development of an effective vaccine."
626,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Its Mutated Variants via CRISPR-Cas13-Based Transcription Amplification.,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global health emergency, and its gene mutation and evolution further posed uncertainty of epidemic risk. Herein, we reported a light-up CRISPR-Cas13 transcription amplification method, which enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutated variants. Sequence specificity was ensured by both the ligation process and Cas13a/crRNA recognition, allowing us to identify viral RNA mutation. Light-up RNA aptamer allows sensitive output of amplification signals via target-activated ribonuclease activity of CRISPR-Cas13a. The RNA virus assay has been designed to detect coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and SARS, as well as the influenza viruses such as, H1N1, H7N9, and H9N2. It was accommodated to sense as low as 82 copies of SARS-CoV-2. Particularly, it allowed us to strictly discriminate key mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 variant, D614G, which may induce higher epidemic and pathogenetic risk. The proposed RNA virus assays are promising for point-of-care monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and its risking variants."
627,Multidisciplinary assessment of the Abbott BinaxNOW SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care antigen test in the context of emerging viral variants and self-administration.,"While there has been significant progress in the development of rapid COVID-19 diagnostics, as the pandemic unfolds, new challenges have emerged, including whether these technologies can reliably detect the more infectious variants of concern and be viably deployed in non-clinical settings as ""self-tests"". Multidisciplinary evaluation of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card (BinaxNOW, a widely used rapid antigen test, included limit of detection, variant detection, test performance across different age-groups, and usability with self/caregiver-administration. While BinaxNOW detected the highly infectious variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) first identified in the UK, B.1.351 (Beta) first identified in South Africa, P.1 (Gamma) first identified in Brazil, B.1.617.2 (Delta) first identified in India and B.1.2, a non-VOC, test sensitivity decreased with decreasing viral loads. Moreover, BinaxNOW sensitivity trended lower when devices were performed by patients/caregivers themselves compared to trained clinical staff, despite universally high usability assessments following self/caregiver-administration among different age groups. Overall, these data indicate that while BinaxNOW accurately detects the new viral variants, as rapid COVID-19 tests enter the home, their already lower sensitivities compared to RT-PCR may decrease even more due to user error."
628,Limit of detection in different matrices of 19 commercially available rapid antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there has been an increase of the use of antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT). The performance of Ag-RDT vary greatly between manufacturers and evaluating their analytical limit of detection (LOD) has become high priority. Here we describe a manufacturer-independent evaluation of the LOD of 19 marketed Ag-RDT using live SARS-CoV-2 spiked in different matrices: direct culture supernatant, a dry swab, and a swab in Amies. Additionally, the LOD using dry swab was investigated after 7 days' storage at - 80 °C of the SARS-CoV-2 serial dilutions. An LOD of ≈ 5.0 × 102 pfu/ml (1.0 × 106 genome copies/ml) in culture media is defined as acceptable by the World Health Organization. Fourteen of 19 Ag-RDTs (ActiveXpress, Espline, Excalibur, Innova, Joysbio, Mologic, NowCheck, Orient, PanBio, RespiStrip, Roche, Standard-F, Standard-Q and Sure-Status) exceeded this performance criteria using direct culture supernatant applied to the Ag-RDT. Six Ag-RDT were not compatible with Amies media and a decreased sensitivity of 2 to 20-fold was observed for eleven tests on the stored dilutions at - 80 °C for 7 days. Here, we provide analytical sensitivity data to guide appropriate test and sample type selection for use and for future Ag-RDT evaluations."
629,Impact of Pool Testing in Detection of Asymptomatic Patients with COVID-19.,"Objective: During the current pandemic, COVID-19 has been detected in patients using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that confirms the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The demand for increased testing, particularly for asymptomatic individuals required alternative approaches to single-patient RT-PCR testing, such as pooling. Methods: This study explored the impact of dilution on the detectability of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients using RT-PCR and demonstrated that pooling can be effective in low prevalence populations. Results: The RT-PCR results for the 3:1, 5:1, and 7:1 aliquot samples showed little differences in CT values, confirming detection capability at these dilutions. Conclusion: Based on the results of the present study, a pooled approach with up to 5:1 sample aliquots and using the current RT-PCR methodology likely will detect SARS CoV2 RNA among asymptomatic patients."
