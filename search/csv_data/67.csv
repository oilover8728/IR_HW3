660,Update From the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.,"The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts, normally meets 3 times per year to develop recommendations for vaccine use in the United States. Because of the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, there are several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently in late-stage clinical trials, so the ACIP is now meeting monthly for single day meetings, with plans to continue standard 2- to 3-day meetings as per usual (February, June, and October). Emergency meetings of ACIP may occur if a vaccine candidate receives an Emergency Use Authorization from the food and drug administration (FDA). This Update provides a combined summary of the August 26 and September 22, 2020, meetings, both of which focused completely on Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. The representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics (Y. A. M. and D. W. K.) and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (S. T. O.) are present as liaisons to the ACIP."

663,A SARS-CoV-2 Reference Standard Quantified by Multiple Digital PCR Platforms for Quality Assessment of Molecular Tests.,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide. To meet the urgent and massive demand for the screening and diagnosis of infected individuals, many in vitro diagnostic assays using nucleic acid tests (NATs) have been urgently authorized by regulators worldwide. A reference standard with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for the study of limit of detection (LoD), which is a crucial feature for a diagnostic assay. Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated virus particles with an accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure. Here, we performed a collaborative study to estimate the NAT-detectable units as a viral genomic equivalent quantity (GEQ) of an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 reference standard candidate using digital PCR (dPCR) on multiple commercialized platforms. The median of the quantification results (4.6 × 105 ± 6.5 × 104 GEQ/mL) was treated as the consensus true value of GEQ of virus particles in the reference standard. This reference standard was then used to challenge the LoDs of six officially approved diagnostic assays. Our study demonstrates that an inactivated whole virus quantified by dPCR can serve as a reference standard and provides a unified solution for assay development, quality control, and regulatory surveillance."
664,Universal COVID-19 screening of 4040 health care workers in a resource-limited setting: an Egyptian pilot model in a university with 12 public hospitals and medical centers.,"Background: The scale of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care workers (HCWs), particularly in resource-limited settings, remains unclear. To address this concern, universal (non-symptom-based) screening of HCWs was piloted to determine the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated epidemiological and clinical risk factors at a large public health care facility in Egypt. Methods: Baseline voluntary screening of 4040 HCWs took place between 22 April and 14 May 2020 at 12 hospitals and medical centres in Cairo. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using an online survey. All participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid IgM and IgG serological tests. Results: Of the 4040 HCWs screened, 170 [4.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-4.9] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by either of the three tests (i.e. infected); 125/170 (73.5%) tested PCR-positive. Most infected HCWs were nurses (97/170, 57.5%). Median age of infected HCWs was 31.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 27.0-41.3] years. Of infected HCWs, 78 (45.9%) reported contact with a suspected case and 47 (27.6%) reported face-to-face contact within 2 m with a confirmed case. The proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs (n = 54/616) was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.7-11.3); 6/54 (11.1%) had fever ≥38°C and 7/54 (13.0%) reported severe symptoms. Most infected HCWs were asymptomatic (116/170, 68.2%). The proportion of infection among asymptomatic HCWs (n = 116/3424) was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8-4.0). Conclusions: The high rate of asymptomatic infections among HCWs reinforces the need for expanding universal regular testing. The infection rate among symptomatic HCWs in this study is comparable with the national rate detected through symptom-based testing. This suggests that infections among HCWs may reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt."

666,Mortality in children with positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test: Lessons learned from a tertiary referral hospital in Indonesia.,"Background: The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still increasing rapidly, but little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of fatal cases in children in Indonesia. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of children with COVID-19 with fatal outcomes in a tertiary referral hospital in Indonesia. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data collected from the medical records of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia from March to October 2020. Results: During the study period, 490 patients were admitted and diagnosed with suspected and probable COVID-19. Of these patients, 50 (10.2%) were confirmed to have COVID-19, and 20 (40%) had a fatal outcome. The fatality rate was higher in patients aged ≥10 years, categorized with severe disease upon admission, PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤300 mmHg and chronic underlying diseases. The most common clinical manifestations were generalized symptoms, while acute respiratory distress syndrome (8/20) and septic shock (7/20) were the two most common causes of death. Increased procalcitonin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase and presepsin levels were found in all fatal cases. One patient met the criteria of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Conclusion: Our work highlights the high mortality rate in paediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. These findings might be related to or co-incided with COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to improve understanding of the role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in elaborating the mechanisms leading to death in children with comorbidities."
667,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR under challenging pre-analytical conditions reveals independence of swab media and cooling chain.,"With global demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing ever rising, shortages in commercially available viral transport media pose a serious problem for laboratories and health care providers. For reliable diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, executed by Real-time PCR, the quality of respiratory specimens, predominantly determined by transport and storage conditions, is crucial. Therefore, our aim was to explore the reliability of minimal transport media, comprising saline or the CDC recommended Viral Transport Media (HBSS VTM), for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus) compared to commercial products, such as the Universal Transport Media (UTM). We question the assumptions, that the choice of medium and temperature for storage and transport affect the accuracy of viral detection by RT-PCR. Both alternatives to the commercial transport medium (UTM), HBSS VTM or saline, allow adequate detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, regardless of storage temperatures up to 28 °C and storage times up to 28 days. Our study revealed the high resilience of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, enabling proper detection in clinical specimens even after long-time storage at high temperatures, independent of the transport medium's composition."
668,Understanding the Barriers to Pooled SARS-CoV-2 Testing in the United States.,"Pooled testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection is instrumental for increasing test capacity while decreasing test cost. Pooled testing programs permit sustainable, long-term surveillance measures, which are essential for the early detection of virus resurgence in communities or the emergence of variants of concern. While numerous pooled approaches have been proposed to increase test capacity, uptake by laboratories has been limited. On 9 December 2020, we invited 362 U.S. laboratories that inquired about the Yale School of Public Health SalivaDirect test to participate in a survey to evaluate testing constraints and pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The survey was distributed using Qualtrics, and three reminders were sent. The survey closed on 21 January 2021. Of 93 responses received (25.7% response rate), 90 were from Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratories conducting SARS-CoV-2 testing. The remaining three were excluded from the analyses. Responses indicated that the major barriers to the uptake of pooled testing in the United States may not simply be the number of tests a laboratory can process per day, but rather the lack of clear protocols and adequate resources; laboratories are working with fixed physical and human capital constraints. Importantly, laboratories across the country are heterogeneous in infrastructure and workflow. The need for SARS-CoV-2 testing will remain for years to come. Testing programs can be maintained through pooled PCR testing strategies, and while statisticians, operations researchers, and others with expertise in sampling design have important value to add, laboratories require support on how to transition from traditional diagnostic testing to pooled surveillance. IMPORTANCE While numerous pooled SARS-CoV-2 testing approaches have been described in an effort to increase testing capacity and decrease test prices, uptake by laboratories has been limited. Responses to our survey of United States-based laboratories highlight the importance of consulting end-users-those that solutions are being designed for-so challenges can be addressed in a manner tailored to meet the specific needs out in the field. It may be surprising to those designing pooled testing strategies to learn that laboratories view pooling as more time-consuming than testing samples individually, and therefore that it is thought to create delays in test reporting."
