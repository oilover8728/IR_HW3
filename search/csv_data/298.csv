2971,Balancing risks: making decisions for maternal treatment without data on fetal safety.,"Challenges arise when treatment to improve maternal health brings the possibility of risk to fetal health. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is the most recent, but hardly the only, example. Because pregnant patients are often specifically excluded from trials of new therapies, this is often the dilemma that patients and providers face when considering new treatments. In this study, we used the COVID-19 vaccine as an exemplar to question the broader issue of how society, in general, and obstetricians, in particular, should balance obligations to pregnant women's right of access to new therapeutic agents with the physician's desire to protect the fetus from potential risks. We will argue that in almost all circumstances (with few exceptions, as will also be discussed), maternal benefit and respect for autonomy create the uncertainty that absent safety data bring. Consequently, if pregnant women choose to try new interventions and treatments, such as the COVID-19 vaccination, they should be offered those new regimens and their decision supported. In addition, we will argue that the right solution to avoid the dilemma of absent data is to include pregnant individuals in clinical trials studying new treatments, drugs, and other therapies. We will also discuss the basis for our opinion, which are mainstream obstetrical ethics, precedents in law (supreme court ruling that forbids companies to exclude women from jobs that might pose a risk to the fetus), and historic events (thalidomide). The ethical framework includes the supposition that sacrifice to improve fetal outcome is a virtue and not a mandate. Denying a pregnant patient treatment because of threats to their life can create absurd and paradoxical consequences. Either requiring abortion or premature delivery before proceeding with treatments to optimize maternal health, or risking a patient's own life and ability to parent a child by delaying treatment brings clear and significant risks to fetal and/or neonatal outcomes. With rare exceptions, properly and ethically balancing such consequential actions cannot be undertaken without considering the values and goals of the pregnant patient. Therefore, active participation of both the pregnant patient and their physician in shared decision making is needed."

2973,"Virology, Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, and Control of COVID-19.","The outbreak of emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) in China has been brought to global attention and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Scientific advancements since the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002~2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 have accelerated our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of therapeutics to treat viral infection. As no specific therapeutics and vaccines are available for disease control, the epidemic of COVID-19 is posing a great threat for global public health. To provide a comprehensive summary to public health authorities and potential readers worldwide, we detail the present understanding of COVID-19 and introduce the current state of development of measures in this review."

2976,Performance of the Roche IL-6 chemiluminescent immunoassay in patients with COVID-like respiratory symptoms.,"Introduction: We evaluated the Roche Elecsys IL6 assay on the Cobas immunoassay analyser. Method: Serum IL6 of 144 controls were compared to 52 samples from patients with COVID-like respiratory symptoms (17 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive); 25 of these were from the intensive care unit (ICU). We compared the IL6 levels to C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels in all cases. Results: The IL6 assay had coefficient-of-variation (CV) of 2.3 % (34.1 pg/mL) and 2.5 % (222.5 pg/mL), a limit of quantitation <1.6 pg/mL, and was linear from 1.6 to 4948 pg/mL. There was a significant difference in IL6 values between patients with COVID-like respiratory symptoms versus controls (p < 0.001). ROC analysis showed that IL6 > 6.4 pg/mL identified symptomatic cases (AUC 0.94, sensitivity 88.2 %, specificity 97.2 %). There was a significant difference between the IL6 of symptomatic ICU/non-ICU cases (median IL6 228 vs 11 pg/mL, p < 0.0001); ROC analysis showed IL6 > 75 pg/mL (sensitivity 76.0 %, specificity 88.9 %) was superior to CRP and PCT in predicting ICU admission (AUC: IL6 0.83, CRP 0.71, PCT 0.82). Conclusion: The performance of Elecsys IL6 assay is in keeping with the manufacturer's claims. IL6 > 6.4 pg/mL differentiates healthy from suspected COVID-19 cases and appears to be raised earlier than the other inflammatory markers in some cases. IL6 > 75 pg/mL was a good predictor of ICU admission."

2978,Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines: a systematic review.,"Objective: To evaluate systematically the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrial.gov, CNKI, Wanfang Data, China Biomedical Literature Service System, and China Clinical Trial Registry were searched for randomized controlled trials of COVID-19 vaccines published up to December 31, 2020. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool was used to assess the quality of studies. A qualitative analysis was performed on the results of clinical trials. Results: Thirteen randomized, blinded, controlled trials, which involved the safety and efficacy of 11 COVID-19 vaccines, were included. In 10 studies, the 28-day seroconversion rate of subjects exceeded 80%. In two 10 000-scale clinical trials, the vaccines were effective in 95% and 70.4% of the subjects, respectively. The seroconversion rate was lower than 60% in only one study. In six studies, the proportion of subjects who had an adverse reaction within 28 days after vaccination was lower than 30%. This proportion was 30%-50% in two studies and > 50% in the other two studies. Most of the adverse reactions were mild to moderate and resolved within 24 hours after vaccination. The most common local adverse reaction was pain or tenderness at the injection site, and the most common systemic adverse reaction was fatigue, fever, or bodily pain. The immune response and incidence of adverse reactions to the vaccines were positively correlated with the dose given to the subjects. The immune response to the vaccines was worse in the elderly than in the younger population. In 6 studies that compared single-dose and double-dose vaccination, 4 studies showed that double-dose vaccination produced a stronger immune response than single-dose vaccination. Conclusions: Most of the COVID-19 vaccines appear to be effective and safe. Double-dose vaccination is recommended. However, more research is needed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the vaccines and the influence of dose, age, and production process on the protective efficacy."
2979,Focused Review: Potential Rare and Atypical Symptoms as Indicator for Targeted COVID-19 Screening.,"The global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 is a known consequence of infection of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has affected nations worldwide with soaring number of cases daily. Symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are commonly presented in COVID-19 patients. This focused review aims to discuss these uncommon and atypical COVID-19 symptoms that may be presented which might affect neurological, cardiovascular, cutaneous and ocular systems and their possible mode of actions. Nonetheless, there are some cases of reported uncommon or atypical symptoms which may warrant healthcare professionals to be aware of, especially when in contact with patients. The knowledge and information concerning these symptoms might be able to provide additional cues for healthcare professional by subjecting patients to COVID-19 screening. Meanwhile, it might be able to further enhance the alertness and additional precautions being taken by healthcare personnel, which eventually lead to reduced risk of infections."
