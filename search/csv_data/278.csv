2772,Leveraging coronavirus binding to gangliosides for innovative vaccine and therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.,"Covid-19 is an infectious respiratory disease due to a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. A critical step of the infection cycle is the binding of the virus spike S protein to the cellular ACE-2 receptor. This interaction involves a receptor binding domain (RBD) located at the center of the S trimer, whereas the lateral N-terminal domain (NTD) displays a flat ganglioside binding site that enables the virus to bind to lipid rafts of the plasma membrane, where the ACE-2 receptor resides. S protein binding to lipid rafts can be blocked by hydroxychloroquine, which binds to gangliosides, and by azithromycin, which binds to the NTD. Based on these data, we identified the NTD of SARS-CoV-2 as a promising target for both therapeutic and vaccine strategies, a notion later supported by the discovery, in convalescent Covid-19 patients, of a neutralizing antibody (4A8) that selectively binds to the NTD. The 4A8 epitope overlaps the ganglioside binding domain, denying any access of the virus to lipid rafts when the antibody is bound to the S protein. Thus, our data explain why antibody binding to the tip of the NTD results in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The high level of conservation of the ganglioside binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 (100% identity in 584 of 600 isolates analyzed worldwide) offers unique opportunities for innovative vaccine/therapeutic strategies."
2773,COVID-19 vaccine challenges: What have we learned so far and what remains to be done?,"Developing and distributing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine has garnered immense global interest. Less than a year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, several vaccine candidates had received emergency use authorization across a range of countries. Despite this scientific breakthrough, the journey from vaccine discovery to global herd immunity against COVID-19 continues to present significant policy challenges that require a collaborative, global response. We offer a framework for understanding remaining and new policy challenges for successful global vaccine campaigns against COVID-19 as well as potential solutions to address them. Decision-makers must be aware of these challenges and strategize solutions that can be implemented at scale. These include challenges around maintaining R&D incentives, running clinical trials, authorizations, post-market surveillance, manufacturing and supply, global dissemination, allocation, uptake, and clinical system adaption. Alongside these challenges, financial and ethical concerns must also be addressed."
2774,Saliva as a Biological Sample for COVID-19 Diagnosis?,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a severe global health problem affecting almost every country in the world. Compared to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be more infectious thereby leading to a rapid spread of this disease across the world. The effective control of this disease relies on timely diagnosis, proper isolation, contact tracing of the infected people and segregation of vulnerable group from potential contamination. Currently, the gold standard diagnostic test for COVID-19 is real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). However, NPS collection has several shortcomings. Besides requiring an active involvement of healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment (PPE), NPS collection is uncomfortable for the patient as it can induce coughing, gagging, vomiting and even bleeding. Evidence from current studies indicates that saliva has a potential to be useful as an alternative biological sample for COVID-19 diagnosis. Indeed, saliva as a biological sample offers several advantages over NPS. Saliva collection is better accepted by patients, it can be self-collected and does not require PPE and active involvement of healthcare personnel. Moreover, preliminary results indicate that the sensitivity and specificity of saliva for COVID-19 diagnosis is similar to that of NPS. This summarizes recent observations in the field and discusses the potential use of saliva for COVID-19 diagnosis."
2775,"EAACI statement on the diagnosis, management and prevention of severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines.","The first approved COVID-19 vaccines include Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162B2, Moderna mRNA-1273 and AstraZeneca recombinant adenoviral ChAdOx1-S. Soon after approval, severe allergic reactions to the mRNA-based vaccines that resolved after treatment were reported. Regulatory agencies from the European Union, Unites States and the United Kingdom agree that vaccinations are contraindicated only when there is an allergy to one of the vaccine components or if there was a severe allergic reaction to the first dose. This position paper of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) agrees with these recommendations and clarifies that there is no contraindication to administer these vaccines to allergic patients who do not have a history of an allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components. Importantly, as is the case for any medication, anaphylaxis may occur after vaccination in the absence of a history of allergic disease. Therefore, we provide a simplified algorithm of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of severe allergic reactions and a list of recommended medications and equipment for vaccine centres. We also describe potentially allergenic/immunogenic components of the approved vaccines and propose a workup to identify the responsible allergen. Close collaboration between academia, regulatory agencies and vaccine producers will facilitate approaches for patients at risks, such as incremental dosing of the second injection or desensitization. Finally, we identify unmet research needs and propose a concerted international roadmap towards precision diagnosis and management to minimize the risk of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines and to facilitate their broader and safer use."

2777,"Mix-and-read, one-minute SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay: development of PIFE-based aptasensor.","We developed a one-minute, one-step SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay based on protein-induced fluorescence enhancement of a DNA aptamer. The system showed significant selectivity and sensitivity towards both nucleocapsid protein and SARS-CoV-2 virus lysate, but with marked improvements in speed and manufacturability. We hence propose this platform as a mix-and-read testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 that can be applied to POC diagnostics in clinical settings, especially in low- and middle-income countries."
2778,"Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Frontline Workers Before and During B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant Predominance - Eight U.S. Locations, December 2020-August 2021.","During December 14, 2020-April 10, 2021, data from the HEROES-RECOVER Cohorts,* a network of prospective cohorts among frontline workers, showed that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were approximately 90% effective in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in real-world conditions (1,2). This report updates vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates including all COVID-19 vaccines available through August 14, 2021, and examines whether VE differs for adults with increasing time since completion of all recommended vaccine doses. VE before and during SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant predominance, which coincided with an increase in reported COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections, were compared (3,4)."
2779,Isothermal SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics: Tools for Enabling Distributed Pandemic Testing as a Means of Supporting Safe Reopenings.,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, poses grave threats to both the global economy and health. The predominant diagnostic screens in use for SARS-CoV-2 detection are molecular techniques such as nucleic acid amplification tests. In this Review, we compare current and emerging isothermal diagnostic methods for COVID-19. We outline the molecular and serological techniques currently being used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, past or present, in patients. We also discuss ongoing research on isothermal techniques, CRISPR-mediated detection assays, and point-of-care diagnostics that have potential for use in SARS-CoV-2 detection. Large-scale viral testing during a global pandemic presents unique challenges, chief among them the simultaneous need for testing supplies, durable equipment, and personnel in many regions worldwide, with each of these regions possessing testing needs that vary as the pandemic progresses. The low-cost isothermal technologies described in this Review provide a promising means by which to address these needs and meet the global need for testing of symptomatic individuals as well as provide a possible means for routine testing of asymptomatic individuals, providing a potential means of safely enabling reopenings and early monitoring of outbreaks."
