2670,Preliminary evidence on the safety profile of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty): new insights from data analysis in EudraVigilance and adverse reaction reports from an Italian health facility.,"The first vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 made available in Italy has been BNT162b2, the two-dose mRNA-based vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech. The ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco hospital is located in one of the areas most affected by the pandemic, and to date over 2000 healthcare professionals have been injected with both vaccine doses. We have collected all spontaneous safety reports in which BNT162b2 was designated as the possible cause. We also have carried out a descriptive analysis of reports submitted in EudraVigilance in the same time-frame and compared our findings with those observed in clinical trials. We have identified several new and unexpected adverse reactions that will be helpful for reviewing the safety profile defined in the Summary of Product Characteristics for this vaccine."
2671,Lack of immune response after mRNA vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 in a solid organ transplant patient.,"The recent approval and distribution of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been a major development in the fight against the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The first two vaccines approved in the United States, mRNA-1273, and BNT162b2, are both messenger RNA (mRNA) based and highly effective in immunocompetent persons, but efficacy in patients on immunosuppressants has not been established. Additionally, data suggests these patients are less likely than immunocompetent people to develop neutralizing antibodies after COVID-19 infection. Given the high risk of poor outcomes in organ transplant and immunosuppressed patients, effective vaccination is paramount in this group. We present the first reported case of a solid organ transplant patient who failed to achieve seroconversion after two doses of mRNA vaccine. This case has significant implications about how immunosuppressed patients should be counseled about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and the protection provided. Physicians should remain clinically suspicious for infection with SARS-CoV-2 despite vaccination status in solid organ transplant patients."
2672,Peptide substrate screening for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay.,"The novel corona (SARS-CoV-2) virus causes a global pandemic, which motivates researchers to develop reliable and effective methods for screening and detection of SARS-CoV-2. Though there are several methods available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 such as RT-PCR and ELSIA, nevertheless, these methods are time-consuming and may not apply at the point of care. In this study, we have developed a specific, sensitive, quantitative and fast detection method for SARS-CoV-2 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The total extracellular protease proteolytic activity from the virus has been used as the biomarker. The specific peptide sequences from the library of 115 dipeptides were identified via changes in the fluorescence signal. The fluorogenic dipeptide substrates have the fluorophore and a quencher at the N- and the C- terminals, respectively. When the protease hydrolyzes the peptide bond between the two specific amino acids, it leads to a significant increase in the fluorescence signals. The specific fluorogenic peptide (H-d) produces a high fluorescence signal. A calibration plot was obtained from the changes in the fluorescence intensity against the different concentrations of the viral protease. The lowest limit of detection of this method was 9.7 Â± 3 pfu/mL. The cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific peptide was tested against the MERS-CoV which does not affect the fluorescence signal. A significant change in the fluorescence signal with patient samples indicates that this FRET-based assay might be applied for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Graphical abstract."
2673,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Keratoplasty and Corneal Eye Banking.,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 guidelines for corneal donor tissue screening and the utility of routine postmortem COVID-19 testing of donors intended for surgical use at a single eye bank. Methods: A retrospective analysis of referrals to and eligible donors from an eye bank between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, was performed, with the same time period in 2019 as a control. Referrals who were not procured because of Eye Bank Association of America COVID-19 guidelines and eye bank-specific restrictions were noted. The results of 1 month of routine postmortem testing performed by the eye bank were examined. Analysis of variance tests were performed to assess the change between donors from 2019 to 2020. Results: There was a significant reduction in both the number of total referrals to the eye bank (P = 0.044) and donors eligible for surgical transplantation (P = 0.031). Eye Bank Association of America COVID-19 guidelines reduced the number of referrals over this period by 4% to 14%. Of the 266 surgically eligible donors who received postmortem COVID-19 testing in June by the eye bank, 13 resulted positive (4.9%). Conclusions: Despite a reduction in referrals and eligible corneal transplant donors at a single eye bank, there was a surplus of surgically suitable corneal tissue during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eye banks should consider routine postmortem COVID-19 testing to identify asymptomatic infected donors although the risk of transmission of COVID-19 from infected donors is unknown."

2676,Antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals with and without COVID-19 vaccination: A method comparison of two different commercially available serological assays from the same manufacturer.,"Background: We compared two serological assays from Roche Diagnostics in individuals with and without COVID-19 vaccination, namely the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (detecting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (detecting antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2). Methods: With both assays, we analyzed 3033 serum samples collected from 2496 patients without COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, we studied 34 healthcare-workers who received two injections of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer three weeks apart and who had repeatedly determined their antibody response by both assays. Results: In our cohort of patients without COVID-19 vaccination, 62.9% of all determinations were negative with both Roche assays and 31.5% were positive with both assays. In 5.6% of our cohort, however, there were discordant results with both assays (partly because initially discordant results of the two assays became concordantly positive over time). In the healthcare-workers with the COVID-19 vaccination, the results of the Roche anti-nucleocapsid assay remained negative throughout the observation period of 5 weeks after vaccination. The initially negative antibodies against the spike protein became positive with the Roche assay in all samples two weeks after the initial injection, and the serum concentrations of anti-spike antibodies increased constantly until 4-5 weeks after the initial injection. Conclusions: Here, we provide information on serological testing with the two Roche assays, which may be important for the application of the two assays in clinical routine. There are differences in the pattern of antibodies in individuals with and without COVID-19 vaccination."
