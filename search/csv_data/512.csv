5110,Cross-validation of ELISA and a portable surface plasmon resonance instrument for IgG antibody serology with SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals.,"We report on the development of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors and matching ELISAs for the detection of nucleocapsid and spike antibodies specific against the novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) in human serum, plasma and dried blood spots (DBS). When exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the immune system responds by expressing antibodies at levels that can be detected and monitored to identify the fraction of the population potentially immunized against SARS-CoV-2 and support efforts to deploy a vaccine strategically. A SPR sensor coated with a peptide monolayer and functionalized with various sources of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins expressed in different cell lines detected human anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in clinical samples. Nucleocapsid expressed in different cell lines did not significantly change the sensitivity of the assays, whereas the use of a CHO cell line to express spike ectodomain led to excellent performance. This bioassay was performed on a portable SPR instrument capable of measuring 4 biological samples within 30 minutes of sample/sensor contact and the chip could be regenerated at least 9 times. Multi-site validation was then performed with in-house and commercial ELISA, which revealed excellent cross-correlations with Pearson's coefficients exceeding 0.85 in all cases, for measurements in DBS and plasma. This strategy paves the way to point-of-care and rapid testing for antibodies in the context of viral infection and vaccine efficacy monitoring."

5112,A 95-year-old patient with unexpected coronavirus disease 2019 masked by aspiration pneumonia: a case report.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection has become a pandemic disease (coronavirus disease 2019). The infection has moved from China to the rest of the world and Italy represents one of the most affected countries. Older adults are more susceptible to develop complications with the consequent highest mortality rates. Case presentation: We report a case of a 95-year-old Caucasian woman affected by pneumonia, initially defined as common aspiration pneumonia in a bedridden patient with vascular dementia, which later turned out to be coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia during the initial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in our district. Some features of a computed tomography scan of her chest and her clinical history with known dysphagia had led at first to a different diagnosis with a consequent exposure of health professionals to infectious risk in two distinct hospitals. In this case report, we describe the clinical/imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and the diagnostic process that led to a correct diagnosis in a nonagenarian with multiple comorbidities. Conclusions: This case report highlights both the possible pitfalls in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in very old patients with comorbidities and the greater than expected spread of the infection, even in individuals with reduced interpersonal contacts and no defined epidemiological link."
5113,COVID-19: From bench to bed side.,"Background and aims: The last two decades have experienced the outbreaks of three different coronaviruses in the different parts of the world namely; Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to delineate the differences in viral dynamics and clinical features between them and tried to focus on every basic details of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) that every health care provider must know. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV that dealt with viral dynamics. Results: Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting. However, case-fatality rates are very high in patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities, compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV."
5114,"Neurologic adverse events among 704,003 first-dose recipients of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in Mexico: A nationwide descriptive study.","mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are remarkably effective. Limited information exists about the incidence of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) with their use. We conducted a prospective observational study including data from 704,003 first-doses recipients; 6536 AEFI were reported, of whom 65.1% had at least one neurologic AEFI (non-serious 99.6%). Thirty-three serious events were reported; 17 (51.5%) were neurologic (observed frequency, 2.4/100,000 doses). At the time of writing this report, 16/17 cases had been discharged without deaths. Our data suggest that the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is safe; its individual and societal benefits outweigh the low percentage of serious neurologic AEFI. This information should help to dissipate hesitancy towards this new vaccine platform."
5115,Predicting intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among the general population using the health belief model and the theory of planned behavior model.,"Background: This study aim to explore the intentions, motivators and barriers of the general public to vaccinate against COVID-19, using both the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model. Methods: An online survey was conducted among Israeli adults aged 18 years and older from May 24 to June 24, 2020. The survey included socio-demographic and health-related questions, questions related to HBM and TPB dimensions, and intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Associations between questionnaire variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Eighty percent of 398 eligible respondents stated their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A unified model including HBM and TPB predictor variables as well as demographic and health-related factors, proved to be a powerful predictor of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine, explaining 78% of the variance (adjusted R squared = 0.78). Men (OR = 4.35, 95% CI 1.58-11.93), educated respondents (OR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.44-8.67) and respondents who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the previous year (OR = 3.31, 95% CI 1.22-9.00) stated higher intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 2.79-7.22), of perceived severity of COVID-19 infection (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.58-3.51) and of cues to action (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.38-2.87), according to HBM, and if they reported higher levels of subjective norms (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 2.15-4.30) and self-efficacy (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.54-2.72) according to TPB. Although half of the respondents reported they had not received influenza vaccine last year, 40% of them intended to receive influenza vaccine in the coming winter and 66% of them intended to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: Providing data on the public perspective and predicting intention for COVID-19 vaccination using HBM and TPB is important for health policy makers and healthcare providers and can help better guide compliance as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to the public."
5116,Use of the FebriDx point-of-care test for the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in a population with acute respiratory infection during the second (COVID-19) wave in Italy.,"Objective: Evaluate the real-world accuracy of Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) detected by the rapid, point-of-care FebriDx test during the second-wave pandemic in Italy in patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) and a clinical suspicion of COVID-19. Design and methods: Prospective, observational, diagnostic accuracy study whereby hospitalized patients with ARI were consecutively enrolled in a single tertiary care center in Italy from August 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. Results: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 136/200 (68.0%) patients and Non-COVID-19 was diagnosed in 64/200 (32.0%) patients. COVID-19 patients were younger and had a lower Charlson comorbidity index compared to Non-COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001). Concordance between FebriDx, MxA and rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (gold standard) was good (k 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.99). Overall sensitivity and specificity were 97.8% [95% CI 93.7-99.5] and 95.3% [95% CI 86.9%-99.0%], respectively. FebriDx demonstrated a negative predictive value of 95.3% (95% CI 86.9-99.0) for an observed disease prevalence of 68%. Conclusions: FebriDx MxA showed high diagnostic accuracy to identify COVID-19 and could be considered as a real-time triage tool to streamline the management of suspected COVID-19 patients. FebriDx also detected bacterial etiology in Non-COVID-19 patients suggesting good performance to distinguish bacterial from viral respiratory infection."
5117,"SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in IBD: Past Lessons, Current Evidence, and Future Challenges.","Since the beginning of the pandemic, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] have been considered at high risk for infection and complications of COVID-19. IBD patients and patients taking immunosuppressive therapy were excluded from clinical phase III vaccine trials, complicating the assessment of effectiveness of these new vaccines. From past experience we know that adapted vaccination strategies may be appropriate in some IBD patients to optimise immunogenicity. We review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination relevant to IBD patients, including immune responses from humoral to cellular, emerging data on new variants, and off-label vaccination schemes. We also identify clinical and scientific knowledge gaps that can be translated into both large-scale population-based studies and targeted vaccine studies to describe the precise immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in IBD patients. We strongly endorse the recommendation of vaccinating IBD patients to ensure maximal protection from COVID-19 both for the individual and the community."
5118,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and reasons for or against adherence among dentists.,"Background: COVID-19 has spread widely among health care workers. Oral health care workers have an increased risk of being infected owing to dental practice characteristics. New, effective vaccines against COVID-19 have been approved for use. The authors aim was to evaluate intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in a population of dentists and identify factors associated with their intentions. Methods: The authors conducted an anonymous online survey among 761 dentists enrolled at the Board of Physicians and Dentists of the District of Monza Brianza, Monza, Italy. The authors collected data on demographic characteristics, influenza vaccine uptake, COVID-19 history, vaccine attitudes, and specific reasons for their intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or not. Results: Overall, 421 dentists completed the survey. More than 82% of the participants declared their intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The multivariate logistic regression model reported a positive association with receiving the influenza vaccine in the 2020-2021 influenza season (odds ratio, 5.15; 95% CI, 2.14 to 12.39) and a negative association with receiving a diagnosis of COVID-19 previously (odds ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.66). The participants' main reason for supporting vaccination was to protect their family and friends (87%) and their main reason for opposing vaccination was the lack of information (39%). Conclusions: It is fundamental to consider vaccine hesitancy in health care workers and address it properly because they must provide recommendations to patients and promote adherence to vaccination programs. Practical implications: The vaccination of dental practitioners should be prioritized owing to the high risk related to dental practice."
5119,Showcasing Nursing Leadership and Contributions to a University's COVID-19 Student Contact Tracing Process.,"The COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented event that impacted every segment of healthcare, including universities preparing healthcare professionals. Instituting processes to coordinate student return to campus and ongoing COVID-19 testing and contract tracing challenged university campuses, but also brought opportunities for collaboration. This article reports on the experiences of one nonprofit private higher education university in management of the COVID-19 testing and contact tracing that were led by school of nursing faculty and nursing leadership."
