691,Identification of 22 N-glycosites on spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and accessible surface glycopeptide motifs: Implications for vaccination and antibody therapeutics.,"Coronaviruses hijack human enzymes to assemble the sugar coat on their spike glycoproteins. The mechanisms by which human antibodies may recognize the antigenic viral peptide epitopes hidden by the sugar coat are unknown. Glycosylation by insect cells differs from the native form produced in human cells, but insect cell-derived influenza vaccines have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In this study, we analyzed recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein secreted from BTI-Tn-5B1-4 insect cells, by trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometry analysis. We acquired tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectrums for glycopeptides of all 22 predicted N-glycosylated sites. We further analyzed the surface accessibility of spike proteins according to cryogenic electron microscopy and homolog-modeled structures and available antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-1. All 22 N-glycosylated sites of SARS-CoV-2 are modified by high-mannose N-glycans. MS/MS fragmentation clearly established the glycopeptide identities. Electron densities of glycans cover most of the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, except YQAGSTPCNGVEGFNCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGYQ, similar to a region FSPDGKPCTPPALNCYWPLNDYGFYTTTGIGYQ in SARS-CoV-1. Other surface-exposed domains include those located on central helix, connecting region, heptad repeats and N-terminal domain. Because the majority of antibody paratopes bind to the peptide portion with or without sugar modification, we propose a snake-catching model for predicted paratopes: a minimal length of peptide is first clamped by a paratope and sugar modifications close to the peptide either strengthen or do not hinder the binding."
692,In silico T cell epitope identification for SARS-CoV-2: Progress and perspectives.,"Growing evidence suggests that T cells may play a critical role in combating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Hence, COVID-19 vaccines that can elicit a robust T cell response may be particularly important. The design, development and experimental evaluation of such vaccines is aided by an understanding of the landscape of T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2, which is largely unknown. Due to the challenges of identifying epitopes experimentally, many studies have proposed the use of in silico methods. Here, we present a review of the in silico methods that have been used for the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes. These methods employ a diverse set of technical approaches, often rooted in machine learning. A performance comparison is provided based on the ability to identify a specific set of immunogenic epitopes that have been determined experimentally to be targeted by T cells in convalescent COVID-19 patients, shedding light on the relative performance merits of the different approaches adopted by the in silico studies. The review also puts forward perspectives for future research directions."
693,Serum pooling for rapid expansion of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing capacity.,"Objectives: Examine possible pooling strategies designed to expand SARS-CoV-2 serological testing capacity. Methods: Negative pools were assessed to determine optimal optical density (OD) cutoffs, followed by spiking weak or strong positive samples to assess initial assay performance. Samples were then randomly subjected to pool and individual testing approaches. Results: Single positive specimens consistently converted pools of 5, 10, or 20 into positive outcomes. However, weaker IgG-positive samples failed to similarly convert pools of 50 to a positive result. In contrast, a stronger individual positive sample converted all pools tested into positive outcomes. Finally, examination of 150 samples configured into pools of 5, 10, 20 or 50 accurately predicted the presence of positive or negative specimens within each pool. Conclusions: These results suggest that pooling strategies may allow expansion of serological testing capacity. While limitations exist, such strategies may aid in large-scale epidemiological screening or identification of optimal convalescent plasma donors."
694,Development of Genetic Diagnostic Methods for Detection for Novel Coronavirus 2019(nCoV-2019) in Japan.,"During the emergence of novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan city, China at the end of 2019, there was movement of many airline travelers between Wuhan and Japan, suggesting that the Japanese population was at high risk of infection by the virus. Hence, we urgently developed diagnostic systems for detection of 2019 nCoV. Two nested RT-PCR and two real-time RT-PCR assays were adapted for use in Japan. As of February 8, 2020, these assays have successfully detected 25 positive cases of infection in Japan."
695,Designing optimal COVID-19 testing stations locally: A discrete event simulation model applied on a university campus.,"Providing sufficient testing capacities and accurate results in a time-efficient way are essential to prevent the spread and lower the curve of a health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with recent research investigating how simulation-based models and tools could contribute to mitigating the impact of COVID-19, a discrete event simulation model is developed to design optimal saliva-based COVID-19 testing stations performing sensitive, non-invasive, and rapid-result RT-qPCR tests processing. This model aims to determine the adequate number of machines and operators required, as well as their allocation at different workstations, according to the resources available and the rate of samples to be tested per day. The model has been built and experienced using actual data and processes implemented on-campus at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where an average of around 10,000 samples needed to be processed on a daily basis, representing at the end of August 2020 more than 2% of all the COVID-19 tests performed per day in the USA. It helped identify specific bottlenecks and associated areas of improvement in the process to save human resources and time. Practically, the overall approach, including the proposed modular discrete event simulation model, can easily be reused or modified to fit other contexts where local COVID-19 testing stations have to be implemented or optimized. It could notably support on-site managers and decision-makers in dimensioning testing stations by allocating the appropriate type and quantity of resources."
696,INSIGHT: A population-scale COVID-19 testing strategy combining point-of-care diagnosis with centralized high-throughput sequencing.,"We present INSIGHT [isothermal NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based amplification) sequencing-based high-throughput test], a two-stage coronavirus disease 2019 testing strategy, using a barcoded isothermal NASBA reaction. It combines point-of-care diagnosis with next-generation sequencing, aiming to achieve population-scale testing. Stage 1 allows a quick decentralized readout for early isolation of presymptomatic or asymptomatic patients. It gives results within 1 to 2 hours, using either fluorescence detection or a lateral flow readout, while simultaneously incorporating sample-specific barcodes. The same reaction products from potentially hundreds of thousands of samples can then be pooled and used in a highly multiplexed sequencing-based assay in stage 2. This second stage confirms the near-patient testing results and facilitates centralized data collection. The 95% limit of detection is <50 copies of viral RNA per reaction. INSIGHT is suitable for further development into a rapid home-based, point-of-care assay and is potentially scalable to the population level."
697,Systems Biology Approaches for Therapeutics Development Against COVID-19.,"Understanding the systems biology approaches for promoting the development of new therapeutic drugs is attaining importance nowadays. The threat of COVID-19 outbreak needs to be vanished for global welfare, and every section of research is focusing on it. There is an opportunity for finding new, quick, and accurate tools for developing treatment options, including the vaccine against COVID-19. The review at this moment covers various aspects of pathogenesis and host factors for exploring the virus target and developing suitable therapeutic solutions through systems biology tools. Furthermore, this review also covers the extensive details of multiomics tools i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, genomics, lipidomics, immunomics, and in silico computational modeling aiming towards the study of host-virus interactions in search of therapeutic targets against the COVID-19."
698,SARS-CoV-2 Positivity on or After 9 Days Among Quarantined Student Contacts of Confirmed Cases.,"This study describes coronavirus test positivity rates among elementary, middle, and high school student contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in a Florida county where schools required a negative test on day 9 before return to school on day 10."
699,"Multicomponent Strategies to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Transmission - Nine Overnight Youth Summer Camps, United States, June-August 2021.","Most U.S. overnight youth camps did not operate during the summer of 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic* (1). Several that did operate demonstrated that multiple prevention strategies, including pre- and postarrival testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, masking, and physical distancing helped prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19; in contrast, camps that relaxed prevention strategies, such as requiring a single prearrival test without subsequent testing, experienced outbreaks (2-4). The availability of COVID-19 vaccines for persons aged ≥12 years enabled implementation of an additional prevention strategy that was not available in summer 2020. This study assessed the number of COVID-19 cases and potential secondary spread among 7,173 staff members and campers from 50 states, 13 countries, and U.S. military overseas bases at nine independently operated U.S. summer youth camps affiliated with the same organization. The camps implemented multiple prevention strategies including vaccination, testing, podding (cohorting), masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene during June-August 2021. Vaccination coverage was 93% among eligible persons aged ≥12 years.† All staff members (1,955) and campers (5,218) received site-specific, protocol-defined screening testing, which included prearrival testing and screening tests during the camp session (38,059 tests). Screening testing identified six confirmed COVID-19 cases (one in a staff member and five in campers) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (screening test positivity rate = 0.02%). Three additional cases (in two staff members and one camper) were identified based on symptoms and were confirmed by RT-PCR testing. Testing for SARS-CoV-2, isolation, and quarantine in a population with high vaccination coverage resulted in no known secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 identified during camp. Implementation of multicomponent strategies is critical for prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks in congregate settings, including overnight youth camps."
