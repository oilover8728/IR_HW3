7890,Guidance for evaluating and testing patients for COVID-19.,This month's selection provides guidance to evaluate and test patients for COVID‐19.
7891,The epidemiological and clinical profile of COVID-19 in children: Moroccan experience of the Cheikh Khalifa University Center.,"Introduction: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus. The first cases were identified in Wuhan. It rapidly spread causing a pandemic worldwide. The incidence and severity of this disease are likely to be different in children compared with adults. Few publications of COVID-19 in children have been published. Our Moroccan paediatric series is among the first studies on this disease in Africa. Methods: We included all children with COVID-19 who were admitted and treated at the hospital from March 25 to April 26, 2020. We have collected information, including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory results, treatments and clinical progress from patients with COVID-19. Results: Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) in Morocco, a total of 145 COVID-19 confirmed cases have been reported in the Cheikh Khalifa's Hospital. Among this cases, 15 children were registered. The median age of patients was 13 years. There were 7 boys and 8 girls. Five children are asymptomatic, 8 have mild symptoms and 2 have a moderate respiratory difficulty. The RT-PCR test results were positive in all patients. Radiologically, we found in 2 cases, multiple nodules with ground-glass opacities on the chest scan. The treatment was based on the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Evolution under treatment was good for all patients. Conclusion: This study describes the profile of COVID-19 in child in a Moroccan hospital and confirms that the severity of illness in children with COVID-19 to be far less than adults."
7892,Systemic or biologic treatment in psoriasis patients does not increase the risk of a severe form of COVID-19.,"Some systemic and biologic psoriasis treatments [SBT] have been associated with an increased risk of infection.1 To date, more and more data regarding the risk of COVID‐19 infection in patients receiving SBT becomes available.2‐5 To enrich these data, we evaluated the frequency of severe COVID‐19 infections, defined as hospitalisation or death, in psoriasis patients receiving SBT, especially during the 4 months following SBT initiation."
7893,PACIFIC: a lightweight deep-learning classifier of SARS-CoV-2 and co-infecting RNA viruses.,"Viral co-infections occur in COVID-19 patients, potentially impacting disease progression and severity. However, there is currently no dedicated method to identify viral co-infections in patient RNA-seq data. We developed PACIFIC, a deep-learning algorithm that accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 and other common RNA respiratory viruses from RNA-seq data. Using in silico data, PACIFIC recovers the presence and relative concentrations of viruses with > 99% precision and recall. PACIFIC accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections in 63 independent in vitro cell culture and patient datasets. PACIFIC is an end-to-end tool that enables the systematic monitoring of viral infections in the current global pandemic."
7894,"Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Residents of a Long-Term Care Skilled Nursing Facility - King County, Washington, March 2020.","Older adults are susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes as a consequence of their age and, in some cases, underlying health conditions (1). A COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County, Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020, highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of these types of facilities (2). On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4)."
7895,CT imaging changes of corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19): a multi-center study in Southwest China.,"Background: Since the first case of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Southwest China. The aim of this study was to describe the imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in southwest China. Methods: In this retrospective study, data were collected from 131 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 3 Chinese hospitals. Their common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement features of chest CT images, were analyzed. Results: A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan, Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases. Complications such as pleural thickening, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected but only in rare cases. For the follow-up chest CT examinations (91 cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of 3.5 days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes. Conclusion: Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID-19. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed consolidation is highly suspicious of COVID-19, that can quickly change over a short period of time."
7896,Resuming professional football (soccer) during the COVID-19 pandemic in a country with high infection rates: a prospective cohort study.,"Objectives: The risk of viral transmission associated with contact sports such as football (soccer) during the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. The aim of this study was to describe the infective and immune status of professional football players, team staff and league officials over a truncated football season resumed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in a country with high infection rates and to investigate the clinical symptoms related to COVID-19 infection in professional football players. Methods: Prospective cohort study of 1337 football players, staff and officials during a truncated football season (9 weeks) with a tailored infection control programme based on preventive measures and regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab testing (every 3-5 days) combined with serology testing for immunity (every 4 weeks). Clinical symptoms in positive participants were recorded using a 26-item, Likert-Scale-based scoring system. Results: During the study period, 85 subjects returned positive (cycle threshold (cT) ≤30) or reactive (30<cT<40) PCR tests, of which 36 were players. The infection rate was consistent with that of the general population during the same time period. More than half of infected subjects were asymptomatic, and the remaining had only mild symptoms with no one requiring hospitalisation. Symptom severity was associated with lower cT values. Social contacts and family were the most common sources of infection, and no infection could be traced to training or matches. Of the 36 infected players, 15 presented positive serology during the study period. Conclusion: Football played outdoors involving close contact between athletes represents a limited risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness when preventive measures are in place."
7897,Differential Tropism of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in Bat Cells.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 did not replicate efficiently in 13 bat cell lines, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus replicated efficiently in kidney cells of its ancestral host, the Rhinolophus sinicus bat, suggesting different evolutionary origins. Structural modeling showed that RBD/RsACE2 binding may contribute to the differential cellular tropism."

7899,A non-RBM targeted RBD specific antibody neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 inducing S1 shedding.,"Potent neutralizing antibodies (Abs) have been proven with therapeutic efficacy for the intervention against SARS-CoV-2. Majority of these Abs function by directly interfering with the virus entry to host cells. Here, we identified a receptor binding domain (RBD) specific monoclonal Ab (mAb) 82A6 with efficient neutralizing potency against authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. As most Abs targeting the non-receptor binding motif (RBM) region, 82A6 was incapable to block the RBD-ACE2 interaction. In particular, it actively promoted the S1 subunit shedding from the S protein, which may lead to effective reduction of intact SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Importantly, it could block potential syncytia formation associated with post-infectious cell surface expression of S proteins. Our study evidenced a RBD specific Ab with unique beneficial efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might bring informative significance to understand the collective effects of neutralizing Abs elicited in COVID-19 patients."
