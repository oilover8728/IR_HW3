5320,A comparative evaluation between the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test device and Abbott Architect SARS CoV-2 IgG assay.,"Introduction: Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 serve as critical diagnostic markers for determining how broadly the COVID-19 pandemic has spread, confirming patient recovery, monitoring potential long-term effects of infection, and evaluating potential protection from reinfection. As new antibody tests become available, it is important to evaluate their performance and utility. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the Abbott PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device against the Abbott ArchitectTM SARS CoV-2 IgG Assay for the detection of the COVID-19 IgG antibody. Methods: Two panels of specimens were utilized to challenge both antibody tests: (1) a set of 150 prepandemic negative specimens collected in 2014, and (2) a set of 122 specimens from 87 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the US and UK that were confirmed with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test result. Results: The ArchitectTM test had a specificity of 100 % and sensitivity of 99.1 % and 93.9 % when excluding or including immunocompromised patients, respectively for specimens collected >14 days post symptom onset or >5 days post-RNA testing. The PanbioTM test had 99.3 % agreement to ArchitectTM. Notably, N = 6 immune-compromised individuals were identified that did not develop detectable antibodies by day 30. Conclusion: There is good concordance between the ArchitectTM SARS CoV-2 IgG Assay and PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device for the detection of SARS CoV-2 IgG."
5321,The Usefulness of the Test-Positive Proportion of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 as a Surveillance Tool.,"Comparison of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case numbers over time and between locations is complicated by limits to virological testing to confirm severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The proportion of tested individuals who have tested positive (test-positive proportion, TPP) can potentially be used to inform trends in incidence. We propose a model for testing in a population experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19 and derive an expression for TPP in terms of well-defined parameters related to testing and presence of other pathogens causing COVID-19-like symptoms. In the absence of dramatic shifts of testing practices in time or between locations, the TPP is positively correlated with the incidence of infection. We show that the proportion of tested individuals who present COVID-19-like symptoms encodes information similar to the TPP but has different relationships with the testing parameters, and can thus provide additional information regarding dynamic changes in TPP and incidence. Finally, we compare data on confirmed cases and TPP from US states up to October 2020. We conjecture why states might have higher or lower TPP than average. Collection of symptom status and age/risk category of tested individuals can increase the utility of TPP in assessing the state of the pandemic in different locations and times."
5322,Negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing following COVID-19 infection in Two MS patients treated with ocrelizumab.,Background: It is unknown whether MS disease modifying therapies impact ability to mount an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Case series and literature review. We report a series of two MS patients who developed COVID-19 while on Ocrelizumab therapy and subsequently exhibited negative SARS-CoV-2 serology. Results: A 42-year-old man and 39-year-old woman with MS developed COVID-19 while on Ocrelizumab therapy. Neither patient required hospitalization. The man exhibited negative serology at 7- and 9-weeks post-infection. The woman exhibited negative serology at 6- and 12-weeks post-infection. Conclusions: Large studies are essential to determine whether certain DMTs may blunt SARS-CoV-2 antibody production.

5324,Selecting a SARS-CoV-2/COVID Molecular Testing Method for Your Laboratory.,"In early March 2020 it became apparent that clinical laboratories would need to quickly develop strategies for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 testing. For most, the initial approach was to send out testing to a reference laboratory. As the pandemic has progressed, the food and drug administration (FDA) has allowed for several manufacturers to make testing reagents commercially available. Concurrently, the demand for rapid accessibility of results persists, leading many laboratories to evaluate options for “in house” testing. This reflection highlights some of the considerations when selecting the best method for your laboratory, with specific examples highlighted from a medium volume laboratory’s experience."

5328,Differential effects of the second SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose on T cell immunity in naive and COVID-19 recovered individuals.,"The rapid development of mRNA-based vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to the design of accelerated vaccination schedules that have been extremely effective in naive individuals. While a two-dose immunization regimen with the BNT162b2 vaccine has been demonstrated to provide a 95% efficacy in naive individuals, the effects of the second vaccine dose in individuals who have previously recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we characterize SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in naive and previously infected individuals during and after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccination. Our results demonstrate that, while the second dose increases both the humoral and cellular immunity in naive individuals, COVID-19 recovered individuals reach their peak of immunity after the first dose. These results suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2."
