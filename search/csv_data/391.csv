3900,Temporal trends and forecasting of COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in Scotland using a national real-time patient-level data platform: a statistical modelling study.,"Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, national-level surveillance platforms with real-time individual person-level data are required to monitor and predict the epidemiological and clinical profile of COVID-19 and inform public health policy. We aimed to create a national dataset of patient-level data in Scotland to identify temporal trends and COVID-19 risk factors, and to develop a novel statistical prediction model to forecast COVID-19-related deaths and hospitalisations during the second wave. Methods: We established a surveillance platform to monitor COVID-19 temporal trends using person-level primary care data (including age, sex, socioeconomic status, urban or rural residence, care home residence, and clinical risk factors) linked to data on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, hospitalisations, and deaths for all individuals resident in Scotland who were registered with a general practice on Feb 23, 2020. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between clinical risk groups and time to hospitalisation and death. A survival prediction model derived from data from March 1 to June 23, 2020, was created to forecast hospital admissions and deaths from October to December, 2020. We fitted a generalised additive spline model to daily SARS-CoV-2 cases over the previous 10 weeks and used this to create a 28-day forecast of the number of daily cases. The age and risk group pattern of cases in the previous 3 weeks was then used to select a stratified sample of individuals from our cohort who had not previously tested positive, with future cases in each group sampled from a multinomial distribution. We then used their patient characteristics (including age, sex, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status) to predict their probability of hospitalisation or death. Findings: Our cohort included 5 384 819 people, representing 98·6% of the entire estimated population residing in Scotland during 2020. Hospitalisation and death among those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and June 23, 2020, were associated with several patient characteristics, including male sex (hospitalisation hazard ratio [HR] 1·47, 95% CI 1·38-1·57; death HR 1·62, 1·49-1·76) and various comorbidities, with the highest hospitalisation HR found for transplantation (4·53, 1·87-10·98) and the highest death HR for myoneural disease (2·33, 1·46-3·71). For those testing positive, there were decreasing temporal trends in hospitalisation and death rates. The proportion of positive tests among older age groups (>40 years) and those with at-risk comorbidities increased during October, 2020. On Nov 10, 2020, the projected number of hospitalisations for Dec 8, 2020 (28 days later) was 90 per day (95% prediction interval 55-125) and the projected number of deaths was 21 per day (12-29). Interpretation: The estimated incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on positive tests recorded in this unique data resource has provided forecasts of hospitalisation and death rates for the whole of Scotland. These findings were used by the Scottish Government to inform their response to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.

3901,Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Detection by Carbon Nanotube-Based Near-Infrared Nanosensors.,"To effectively track and eliminate COVID-19, it is critical to develop tools for rapid and accessible diagnosis of actively infected individuals. Here, we introduce a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based optical sensing approach toward this end. We construct a nanosensor based on SWCNTs noncovalently functionalized with ACE2, a host protein with high binding affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicits a robust, 2-fold nanosensor fluorescence increase within 90 min of spike protein exposure. We characterize the nanosensor stability and sensing mechanism and passivate the nanosensor to preserve sensing response in saliva and viral transport medium. We further demonstrate that these ACE2-SWCNT nanosensors retain sensing capacity in a surface-immobilized format, exhibiting a 73% fluorescence turn-on response within 5 s of exposure to 35 mg/L SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles. Our data demonstrate that ACE2-SWCNT nanosensors can be developed into an optical tool for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection."
3902,Recent biotechnological tools for diagnosis of corona virus disease: A review.,"Recently, a corona virus disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel corona virus (sevier acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2; SARS-CoV-2), rapidly spread throughout the world. It has been resulted an unprecedented public health crisis and has become a global threat. WHO declared it as a pandemic due to rapid transmission and severity of the disease. According to WHO, as of 22nd of August 2020, the disease spread over 213 countries of the world having 22,812,491 confirmed cases and 795,132 deaths recorded worldwide. In the absence of suitable antiviral drugs and vaccines, the current pandemic has created an urgent need for accurate diagnostic tools that would be helpful for early detection of the patients. Many tests including classical and high-throughput techniques have developed and obtained U.S. Food and drug administration (FDA) approval. However, efforts are being made to develop new diagnostic tools for detection of the disease. Several molecular diagnostic tests such as real-time-polymerase chain reaction, real-time isothermal loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP), full genome analysis by next-generation sequencing, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats technique and microarray-based assays along with other techniques such as computed tomography scan, biomarkers, biosensor, nanotechnology, serological test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), isolation of viral strain in cell culture are currently available for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. This review provides a brief overview of promising high-throughput techniques currently used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, along with their scope and limitations that may be used for effective control of the disease."
3903,"A review of monoclonal antibodies in COVID-19: Role in immunotherapy, vaccine development and viral detection.","The harmful COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus imposes the scientific community to develop or find conventional curative drugs, protective vaccines, or passive immune strategies rapidly and efficiently. Passive immunity is based on recovering hyper-immune plasma from convalescent patients, or monoclonal antibodies with elevated titer of neutralizing antibodies with high antiviral activity, that have potential for both treatment and prevention. In this review, we focused on researching the potentiality of monoclonal antibodies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection. Our research review includes antibody-based immunotherapy, using human monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral protein regions, specifically the spike protein regions, and using hyper-immune plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients, in which monoclonal antibodies act as immunotherapy for the cytokine storm syndrome associated with the COVID-19 infection. In addition, we will demonstrate the role of the monoclonal antibodies in the development of candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the recent progress of the diagnostic mouse monoclonal antibodies' role will be highlighted, as an accurate and rapid diagnostic assay, in the antigen detection of SARS-CoV-2. In brief, the monoclonal antibodies are the potential counter measures that may control SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, through immunotherapy and vaccine development, as well as viral detection."
3904,"Endemic infections, vaccinations, and variability of SARS-COV2 worldwide epidemiology: A cross-sectional study.","The present article aims to analyze epidemiologic aspects of the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) over different countries across the globe. While analyzing the overall spread of the disease, clusters of countries could be identified where the population-adjusted number of cases and mortality rates (MRs) were significantly different from the others. To draw a comparison over the countries at the same stage of infection, the nature and spread of the infection was evaluated at the 90th day of the pandemic for each country. It was observed that the countries with prevalent malarial transmission tended to have lesser population-adjusted COVID-19 caseloads. It was further observed that high population coverage of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination was negatively associated with population-adjusted caseloads and MRs due to COVID-19. The present cross-sectional study is an attempt to bring in several social, economic, and structural confounders into understanding of the nature and spread of this novel pandemic globally."
3905,Letter: Liver injury in COVID-19: Diagnosis and associated factors-Authors' reply.,"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a new, emerging infectious disease, guidance or consensus on liver injury are lacking2. The definition of COVID‐19 associated liver injury in our manuscript was as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or bilirubin above the upper limit of normal (ULN), which were 50 U/L, 40 U/L, and 26 μmol/l respectively. The abnormal test results of ALT, AST and total bilirubin at baseline data were defined as liver injury in our manuscript."
3906,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 prototype serologic test in hospitalized patients.,"Objectives: Humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in several patient cohorts with results that vary by method and population studied due to the lack of reliable commercial assays available as the pandemic initially spread. We sought to clinically assess commercial prototype SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays for use in screening for prior infection and convalescent plasma donation. Design and methods: Prototype SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays from Euroimmun were assessed utilizing remnant specimens. Specificity testing used specimens in their convalescent window for the common coronaviruses and other infectious diseases known to be associated with increased non-specificity in serologic assays. Sensitivity testing utilized serial specimens from molecularly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 critically ill patients to assess seroconversion. Utilizing recombinant spike protein we also developed a competitive confirmation procedure to increase assay specificity. Results: We determined specificity to be 97% and 81%, respectively, when indeterminate samples were considered positive and 99% and 86% when indeterminate samples were considered negative. We developed a new confirmation methodology to enhance the specificity of the assays with an anticipated specificity of 98% for IgA. Valuation of hospitalized COVID-19 patients determined median IgA seroconversion to be 8 days and IgG 10 days. Neither level nor timing of antibody response correlated with days on ventilation. End titer measurements indicate that validated improved assays may be capable of semi-quantitative measurement. Conclusions: We found these assays to be clinically acceptable for the high prevalence population tested, for instance, for convalescent plasma donation."

3908,Early experience with universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in a New York-based reproductive endocrinology practice.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic peak around March 2020 led to temporary closures of most fertility clinics. Many clinics reopened but required universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, the rate of positive results and the necessity for such testing is unknown. We report here on early results from asingle-center academic NewYork fertility practice utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. This mixed prospective retrospective cohort included 164 patients who underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 screening test for fertility treatment between May and July2020. Patients completed 1 to 3 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 tests per cycle and remained symptom-free to continue fertility treatments. SARS-CoV-2 test results, past results, history of Covid-19 infection, and patient/cycle characteristics were recorded and tabulated through October2020. Outcomes included positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, rate of prior Covid-19 infections, and clinical courses of patients testing positive. Patients underwent 263 cycles entailing 460 total SARS-CoV-2 screening tests. Fifteen patients reported astrong prior clinical history of Covid-19. Six patients experienced apositive SARS-CoV-2 test (2.3% of all cycles). Among 77 cycles (n = 58 patients) entailing one SARS-CoV-2 test, 2 cases (2.6%) were noted. Among 173 cycles (n = 121 patients) entailing two SARS-CoV-2 tests, 4 cycles (2.3%) were noted. Zero (0%) of 13 cycles (n = 13 patients) entailing 3 SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive. All patients were cleared to resume treatment within one month. Overall, anew asymptomatic infection was identified in 2 cycles (0.8%), while 4 of the 6 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were among patients with aprior history of Covid-19. 3 of 4 also had adocumented prior positive RNA test. Our data suggest that universal SARS-CoV-2 screening among fertility patients is feasible, with an approximately 2% positive rate per cycle among the patients of this study. Most positive patients had aprior remote infection, but their infectiousness while being screened remains unclear.Abbreviations: REI: reproductive endocrinology and infertility; IUI: intrauterine insemination; IVF: in vitro fertilization; sono: sonography; cryo: cryopreservation; FET: frozen embryo transfer."
