5930,Low utilisation of bronchoscopy to assess COVID-19 respiratory infection: a multicenter experience.,"Objective: For the diagnosis of COVID-19, the yield of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs is unclear, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is obtained to confirm the diagnosis. We assessed the utilisation of bronchoscopy for COVID-19 diagnosis in a multicenter study and compared the diagnostic yield of BAL versus NP swabs. Methods: This retrospective study included all patients who were admitted with clinical presentation concerning for COVID-19 and underwent BAL from 1 March to 31 July 2020 at four tertiary care centres in North America. We also compared concordance of BAL with NP swabs for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Results: Fifty-three patients, with clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and admitted for respiratory failure, underwent bronchoscopy to collect BAL for SARS-CoV-2 testing. During the same period, 2039 bronchoscopies were performed on patients not infected with COVID-19. Of 42 patients with NP swabs and BAL collected within ≤7 days, 1 was NP swab negative but positive by BAL for SARS-CoV-2 (n=1/42 (2.4%)). Across a wide array of testing platforms, the overall agreement between NP swabs and BAL results was 97.6% (95% CI: 93.0% to 100%) with Cohen's k of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.69 to 1.00). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of NP swabs compared with BAL were 83.3% (95% CI: 53.5% to 100%), 100%, 100% and 97.3% (95% CI: 92.1% to 100%), respectively. Conclusions: BAL was used infrequently to assess COVID-19 in busy institutions. NP swabs have a high concordance with BAL for COVID-19 testing, but negative NP swabs should be confirmed with BAL when clinical suspicion is high."

5932,MIS-C and Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities.,"Objectives: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has spread through the pediatric population during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Our objective for the study was to report the prevalence of conduction anomalies in MIS-C and identify predictive factors for the conduction abnormalities. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients <21 years of age presenting with MIS-C over a 1-month period. We collected clinical outcomes, laboratory findings, and diagnostic studies, including serial electrocardiograms, in all patients with MIS-C to identify those with first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) during the acute phase and assess for predictive factors. Results: Thirty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Median age at admission was 9 years. Six of 32 patients (19%) were found to have first-degree AVB, with a median longest PR interval of 225 milliseconds (interquartile range 200-302), compared with 140 milliseconds (interquartile range 80-178) in patients without first-degree AVB. The onset of AVB occurred at a median of 8 days after the initial symptoms and returned to normal 3 days thereafter. No patients developed advanced AVB, although 1 patient developed a PR interval >300 milliseconds. Another patient developed new-onset right bundle branch block, which resolved during hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes, inflammatory markers, and cardiac function were not associated with AVB development. Conclusions: In our population, there is a 19% prevalence of first-degree AVB in patients with MIS-C. All patients with a prolonged PR interval recovered without progression to high-degree AVB. Patients admitted with MIS-C require close electrocardiogram monitoring during the acute phase."

5934,"COVID-19: Current understanding of its Pathophysiology, Clinical presentation and Treatment.","Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 is a novel coronavirus belonging to the family Coronaviridae and is now known to be responsible for the outbreak of a series of recent acute atypical respiratory infections originating in Wuhan, China. The disease caused by this virus, termed coronavirus disease 19 or simply COVID-19, has rapidly spread throughout the world at an alarming pace and has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. In this review, an update on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and the most recent management strategies for COVID-19 has been described. Materials and methods: A search was conducted for literature and various articles/case reports from 1997 to 2020 in PUBMED/MEDLINE for the keywords coronavirus, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and mRNA virus. Results and conclusions: COVID-19 has now spread globally with increasing morbidity and mortality among all populations. In the absence of a proper and effective antibody test, the diagnosis is presently based on a reverse-transcription PCR of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples. The clinical spectrum of the disease presents in the form of a mild, moderate or severe illness. Most patients are either asymptomatic carriers who despite being without symptoms have the potential to be infectious to others coming in close contact, or have a mild influenza-like illness which cannot be differentiated from a simple upper respiratory tract infection. Moderate and severe cases require hospitalisation as well as intensive therapy which includes non-invasive as well as invasive ventilation, along with antipyretics, antivirals, antibiotics and steroids. Complicated cases may require treatment by immunomodulatory drugs and plasma exchange therapy. The search for an effective vaccine for COVID-19 is presently in full swing, with pharmaceutical corporations having started human trials in many countries."
5935,COVID-19 vaccines and kidney disease.,"Patients with kidney diseases should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination and the available data suggest that replication-defective viral-vectored vaccines and mRNA vaccines are safe to use. As vaccine responses are likely to be lower in patients with kidney diseases than in the general population, highly potent vaccines should be preferred."
5936,Assessment of 12 qualitative RT-PCR commercial kits for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"The emergence of the novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the late months of 2019 had the officials to declare a public health emergency leading to a global response. Public measurements rely on an accurate diagnosis of individuals infected with the virus by using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The aim of our study is to relate the fundamental clinical and analytical performance of SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR) commercial kits. A total of 94 clinical samples were selected. Generally, 400 µl of each respiratory specimen was subjected to extraction using ExiPrep 96 Viral RNA Kit. All kits master mix preparation, cycling protocol, thermocycler, and results interpretation were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions of use and recommendations. The performance of the kits was comparable except for the LYRA kit as it was less sensitive (F = 67, p < .001). Overall, four kits scored a sensitivity of 100% including: BGI, IQ Real, Sansure, and RADI. For specificity, all the tested kits scored above 95%. The performance of these commercial kits by gene target showed no significant change in CT values which indicates that kits disparities are mainly linked to the oligonucleotide of the gene target. We believe that most of the commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this study can be used for routine diagnosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2. We recommend including kits with multiple targets in order to monitor the virus changes over time."
5937,Vaccines for COVID-19: perspectives from nucleic acid vaccines to BCG as delivery vector system.,This article discusses standard and new disruptive strategies in the race to develop an anti-COVID-19 vaccine. We also included new bioinformatic data from our group mapping immunodominant epitopes and structural analysis of the spike protein. Another innovative approach reviewed here is the use of BCG vaccine as priming strategy and/or delivery system expressing SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
5938,Racial disparities in COVID-19 associated pulmonary embolism: A multicenter cohort study.,"Background: Thromboembolism is a recognized component of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. However, research into racial disparities in COVID-19-related pulmonary embolism is limited. Materials and methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we examined adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 20 and September 30, 2020, using a multicenter electronic health record dataset of over 73 million patients (TriNetX), mostly in the USA. The main study outcomes were development of pulmonary embolism or mortality within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Secondary outcome analysis included hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission within 30 days of diagnosis, as well as lab values within 0-1 days of diagnosis. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were used to create balanced cohorts via propensity matching. Results: 346,953 patients were identified, with 56.0% non-Hispanic white and 14.7% non-Hispanic black; the mean age was 47.6 years. 3879 patients developed PE, with 2036 (1.30% of 157,049) white and 1088 (2.16% of 50,376) black patients. After propensity matching, black race was associated with higher mortality (risk ratio 1.890 [95% CI 1.727-2.067]) and PE (RR 1.537 [1.380-1.711]; p < 0.0001). Both races had higher mortality with COVID-associated PE than COVID or PE alone (RR 1.575-1.627 and 3.000-5.389 respectively; p < 0.0001). Black patients with COVID-19 and PE had a higher rate of mortality compared to white patients (RR 1.397 [1.059-1.844]; p = 0.0174). Interpretation: Black race was associated with higher risk of pulmonary embolism and mortality after COVID-19. Additionally, black patients with COVID-19 and PE had a higher mortality compared to white patients."
5939,A follow-up study shows that recovered patients with re-positive PCR test in Wuhan may not be infectious.,"Background: Previous studies showed that recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can have a subsequent positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after they are discharged from the hospital. Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of recovered COVID-19 patients who have a re-positive test is vital for preventing a second wave of COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of 20,280 COVID-19 patients from multiple centers in Wuhan who had a positive PCR test between December 31, 2019, and August 4, 2020. The RT-PCR test results for 4079 individuals who had close contact with the re-positive cases were also obtained. Results: In total, 2466 (12.16%) of the 20,280 patients had a re-positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test after they were discharged from the hospital, and 4079 individuals had close contact with members of this patient group. All of these 4079 individuals had a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Conclusions: This retrospective study in Wuhan analyzed the basic characteristics of recovered COVID-19 patients with re-positive PCR test and found that these cases may not be infectious."
