3390,"Dynamic profile of RT-PCR findings from 301 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China: A descriptive study.","Background: With the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, its effect on society is amplified. We aimed to describe the viral detection results across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods: A retrospective study of 301 confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, were included. Demographic characteristics of the patients were collected. Upper respiratory specimens (throat and/or nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Period of viral infection and the contagious stage were analyzed. Results: Of 301 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 58 years and 51.2 % were male. The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, N = 301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; N = 216). Infected patient ≥65 years old stayed contagious longer (22 days vs 19 days, p = 0.015). Although two consecutive negative results were confirmed in 70 patients, 30 % of them had positive viral test results for the third time. Using specimens from nasal swabs to run the RT-PCR test showed a higher positive rate than using specimens from throat swabs. Conclusions: This large-scale investigation with 1113 RT-PCR test results from 301 COVID-19 patients showed that the average contagious period of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 20 days. Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients ≥65 years."

3394,A hub-and-spoke design for ultra-cold COVID-19 vaccine distribution.,"An orderly and effective vaccination campaign is essential in combating the global COVID-19 pandemic. As one of the pioneers, the U.S. Center for Disease Control proposes a phased plan to promote the vaccination process. This plan starts with vaccinating the high-priority population in Phase 1, then turns to the remainder of the public in Phase 2, and ends with a scale-back network in Phase 3. The phased plan not only provides a sense of hope to impacted communities that this global pandemic can be defeated, but can serve as a template for other countries. To enhance this plan, this paper develops a generalizable framework for designing a hub-and-spoke vaccination dispensing network to achieve the goals in the Phase 2, which aims to expand the vaccination coverage for the general public. We introduce a new coverage index to measure the priority of different potential dispensing sites based on geo-data and develop an optimization model for network design. The hub-and-spoke network enhances the accessibility of the vaccines to various communities and helps to overcome the challenges related to ultra-cold storage facility shortage. A case study of Middlesex County in New Jersey is presented to demonstrate the application of the framework and provide insights for the Phase 2. Results from the baseline scenario show that increasing the driving time limit from 10 min to 25 min can improve the total coverage index from 40.8 to 55.9. Additionally, we explore how the changes of parameters impact the network design and discuss potential solutions for some special cases. When we allow 4 outreach nodes per hub, all potential 45 outreach points can be covered in the vaccination network within a 20-minute drive, and the total coverage index reaches its maximum value of 58.3."
3395,Temporary derogation from European environmental legislation for clinical trials of genetically modified organisms for coronavirus disease 2019.,"Attempts to streamline environmental procedures for those products containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) among the European Union (EU) Member States are ongoing but still need to be further developed. These procedures can be complex, resource-intensive and time-consuming. Some candidate vaccines currently under development for COVID-19 include genetically modified viruses, which may be considered GMOs. Given the public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, on July 15, 2020, the European Parliament approved a temporary derogation of the European environmental requirements to facilitate that those clinical trials with GMOs intended to treat or prevent COVID-19 can start as soon as possible in Europe. This measure has been very controversial, since it could entail risks to human health and the environment, and could be seen as unfair for other products targeting unmet medical needs. With the adoption of this measure, the bottlenecks and obstacles for the development of innovative GMO-based medicines in the EU that the environmental legislation entails have become even more evident."
