3960,A COVID-19 vaccine-dare to dream.,"The global desire to produce and deploy a safe and effective vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the morbidity and mortality subsequent to COVID-19 is unprecedented. The unparalleled speed of research development and access to funding is perhaps equally unique in the history of therapeutic achievement. This article, the third in a series of dedicated to exploring the origins and developments of SARS-CoV-2 within the context of the strategies of infection prevention and control, investigates the theatre behind the extraordinary efforts underpinning the research for therapeutic interventions to halt the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce has stated that the exit strategy depends on a vaccine that is effective in reducing mortality, improving population health by reducing serious disease and protecting the NHS and social care system. This article introduces the major COVID-19 vaccine contenders and considers the challenges and opportunities of an effective global vaccination strategy."

3962,Initial impact of SARS-Cov-2 vaccination on healthcare workers in Italy- Update on the 28th of March 2021.,"In Italy, the COVID-19 vaccination campaign started in December 2020 with the vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW). To analyse the real-life impact that vaccination is having on this population group, we measured the association between week of diagnosis and HCW status using log-binomial regression. By the week 22-28 March, we observed a 74% reduction (PPR 0.26; 95% CI 0.22-0.29) in the proportion of cases reported as HCW and 81% reduction in the proportion of symptomatic cases reported as HCW, compared with the week with the lowest proportion of cases among HCWs prior to the vaccination campaign (31 August-7 September). The reduction, both in relative and absolute terms, of COVID-19 cases in HCWs that started around 30 days after the start of the vaccination campaign suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are being effective in preventing infection in this group."

3965,"COVID-19 vaccination in patients with diabetes mellitus: Current concepts, uncertainties and challenges.","Background and aims: To summarize the available evidence on the use COVID-19 vaccines in patients with diabetes mellitus. Methods: We performed a thorough literature search with regard to COVID-19 vaccines in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) tends to portend a poor prognosis in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Primary prevention remains the mainstay for mitigating the risks associated with COVID-19 in patients with DM. A significant step in primary prevention is timely vaccination. Routine vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, and hepatitis B is recommended in patients with DM with good efficacy and reasonable safety profile. With clinical data supporting a robust neutralizing antibody response in COVID-19 patients with DM, vaccination in individuals with DM is justified. In fact, as the burden of the disease is borne by people with DM, COVID-19 vaccination should be prioritized in individuals with DM. Multiple unresolved issues with regard to preferred vaccine type, vaccine efficacy and durability, frequency of administration, vaccination in children (<18 years) and pregnant/lactating women however remain, and need to be addressed through future research. Conclusions: Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus are at a high risk of poor prognosis with COVID-19 and vaccination should be prioritized in them. However, many unresolved issues with regard to COVID-19 vaccination need to be addressed through future research."

Dosimetry and descriptive statistics of both modalities were analyzed.On uld CT, parenchymal abnormalities compatible with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were detected in 10/12 (83%) patients whereas on chest X-ray in, respectively, 8/12 (66%) and 5/12 (41%) patients for reader 1 and 2. The average increment of diagnostic performance of uld CT compared to chest X-ray was 29%. The average effective dose was, respectively, of 0.219 and 0.073 mSv.Uld CT detects substantially more lung injuries in symptomatic patients with suspected early stage SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to chest radiographs, with a significantly better inter-reader agreement, at the cost of a slightly higher equivalent radiation dose."
