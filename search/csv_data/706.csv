7050,Role of Multiomics Data to Understand Host-Pathogen Interactions in COVID-19 Pathogenesis.,"Human infectious diseases are contributed equally by the host immune system's efficiency and any pathogens' infectivity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the coronavirus strain causing the respiratory pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To understand the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2, one needs to unravel the intricacies of host immune response to the virus, the viral pathogen's mode of transmission, and alterations in specific biological pathways in the host allowing viral survival. This review critically analyzes recent research using high-throughput ""omics"" technologies (including proteomics and metabolomics) on various biospecimens that allow an increased understanding of the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The altered biomolecule profile facilitates an understanding of altered biological pathways. Further, we have performed a meta-analysis of significantly altered biomolecular profiles in COVID-19 patients using bioinformatics tools. Our analysis deciphered alterations in the immune response, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism and other pathways that cumulatively result in COVID-19 disease, including symptoms such as hyperglycemic and hypoxic sequelae."
7051,"False ground-glass opacity and suspicion of COVID-19, beware of the technique for performing the CT.","Ground-glass opacity is a CT sign that is currently experiencing renewed interest since it is very common in patients with COVID-19. However, this sign is not specific to any disease. Besides, the possibility of false positive ground-glass opacity related to insufficient inspiration during the acquisition of the chest CT should be known. We report the case of a 36-year-old patient suspected of COVID-19 and in whom a second acquisition of chest CT was necessary to remove false ground-glass opacities that erroneously supported the diagnosis of COVID-19."

7053,Are dental schools adequately preparing dental students to face outbreaks of infectious diseases such as COVID-19?,"The recent 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as SARS-CoV-2) has caused >2,622,571 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in >185 countries, and >182,359 deaths globally. More than 9000 healthcare workers have also been infected by 2019-nCoV. Prior to the present pandemic of COVID-19, there have been multiple large-scale epidemics and pandemics of other viral respiratory infections, such as seasonal flu, Spanish flu (H1N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and others. Dental professionals are at an increased risk for contracting these viruses from dental patients, as dental practice involves face-to-face communication with the patients and frequent exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids. Dental education can play an important role in the training of dentists, helping them to adopt adequate knowledge and attitudes related to infection control measures. The current dental curriculum does not cover infection control adequately, especially from airborne pathogens. Infection control education needs to be included in the dental curriculum itself, and students should be trained adequately to protect them and prevent the infection from disseminating even before they see their first patient."

7055,Prognostic implications of myocardial injury in patients with and without COVID-19 infection treated in a university hospital.,"Introduction and objectives: Cardiac troponin, a marker of myocardial injury, is frequently observed in patients with COVID-19 infection. Our objective was to analyze myocardial injury and its prognostic implications in patients with and without COVID-19 infection treated in the same period of time. Methods: The present study included patients treated in a university hospital with cardiac troponin I measurements and with suspected COVID-19 infection, confirmed or ruled out by polymerase chain reaction analysis. The impact was analyzed of cardiac troponin I positivity on 30-day mortality. Results: In total, 433 patients were distributed among the following groups: confirmed COVID-19 (n=186), 22% with myocardial injury (n=41); and ruled out COVID-19 (n=247), 21.5% with myocardial injury (n=52). The confirmed and ruled out COVID-19 groups had a similar age, sex, and cardiovascular history. Mortality was significantly higher in the confirmed COVID-19 group than in the ruled out group (19.9% vs 5.3%, P <.001). In Cox multivariate regression analysis, cardiac troponin I was a predictor of mortality in both groups (confirmed COVID-19 group: HR, 3.54; 95%CI, 1.70-7.34; P=.001; ruled out COVID-19 group: HR, 5.57; 95%CI, 1.70-18.20; P=.004). The predictive model analyzed by ROC curves was similar in the 2 groups (P=.701), with AUCs of 0.808 in the confirmed COVID-19 group (0.750-0.865) and 0.812 in the ruled out COVID-19 group (0.760-0.864). Conclusions: Myocardial injury is detected in 1 in every 5 patients with confirmed or ruled out COVID-19 and predicts 30-day mortality to a similar extent in both circumstances."
7056,Association of COVID-19 with skin diseases and relevant biologics: a cross-sectional study using nationwide claim data in South Korea.,"Background: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread, information about COVID-19 and skin disease or related biologics is still lacking. Objectives: To identify the association between COVID-19 and skin diseases or biologics. Methods: A nationwide claim dataset relevant to COVID-19 in South Korea was analysed. This dataset included insurance claim data before and during COVID-19 treatment and clinical outcomes. Claim data related to skin diseases and relevant biologics were analysed to determine the association of COVID-19 with skin diseases and relevant biologics. Results: The dataset contained a total of 234 427 individuals (111 947 male and 122 480 female) who underwent COVID-19 testing. Of them, 7590 (3·2%) were confirmed as having COVID-19, and 227 (3·0%) confirmed patients died. Among various skin diseases and biologics, no significant increase in the presence of specific skin diseases or exposure to biologics was observed in the COVID-19-positive group, even after adjusting for or matching covariates. The presence of skin diseases and exposure to biologics also did not seem to affect clinical outcomes including mortality. Conclusions: Underlying skin diseases did not appear to increase susceptibility to COVID-19 or mortality from COVID-19. Considering the risks and benefits, biologics for dermatological conditions might be continuously used during the COVID-19 pandemic."
7057,[Clinical features and chest CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 in infants and young children].,"Objective: To study the clinical features and chest CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in infants and young children. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data and chest CT images of 9 children, aged 0 to 3 years, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by nucleic acid detection between January 20 and February 10, 2020. Results: All 9 children had an epidemiological history, and family clustering was observed for all infected children. Among the 9 children with COVID-19, 5 had no symptoms, 4 had fever, 2 had cough, and 1 had rhinorrhea. There were only symptoms of the respiratory system. Laboratory examination showed no reductions in leukocyte or lymphocyte count. Among the 9 children, 6 had an increase in lymphocyte count and 2 had an increase in leukocyte count. CT examination showed that among the 9 children, 8 had pulmonary inflammation located below the pleura or near the interlobar fissure and 3 had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundles. As for the morphology of the lesions, 6 had nodular lesions and 7 had patchy lesions; ground glass opacity with consolidation was observed in 6 children, among whom 3 had halo sign, and there was no typical paving stone sign. Conclusions: Infants and young children with COVID-19 tend to have mild clinical symptoms and imaging findings not as typical as those of adults, and therefore, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be made based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection. Chest CT has guiding significance for the early diagnosis of asymptomatic children."
7058,Role of Toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a pandemic since March 2020. The exact pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of each component of the innate and adaptive immune system is still unknown. However, available data from other coronavirus families, such as SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome and also new findings could be useful for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2. Toll-like receptors (TLR) play an important role in recognition of viral particles and activation of the innate immune system. Activation of TLR pathways leads to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as type 1 interferon. Different TLRs, like TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are potentially important in COVID-19 infection. It is also worth mentioning that we should bear in mind both the beneficial and harmful effects of TLR in confronting COVID-19 infection. TLRs could be a potential target in controlling the infection in the early stages of disease and production of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2."
