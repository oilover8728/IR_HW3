8750,Risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to medical staff and patients from an exposure to a COVID-19-positive ophthalmologist.,"Purpose: To evaluate the risk of transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after exposure to a COVID-19+ physician in a retina clinic. Methods: A retrospective observational study. Records of 142 patients and 11 staff members from a single retina clinic that were exposed to a COVID-19+ ophthalmologist were reviewed. All 153 individuals were placed in quarantine for 14 days. They were contacted after the quarantine period to inquire about symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and the results of diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 when performed. Results: All patients (n = 142) were contacted successfully. The mean age was 72.8 ± 13.6 years; 54.2% (n = 77) were females. Twenty-three patients (16.2%) were exposed during an ophthalmic exam, 111 (78.2%) during intraocular injection, 4 (2.8%) underwent exam and injection, 3 (2.1%) underwent surgery, and one patient (0.7%) had laser photocoagulation. Half of the patients (50%; n = 71) were in contact with the COVID-19+ physician while he was symptomatic. Forty-four patients (31%) wore a mask on the day of their visit. 11.3% (n = 16) of the patients, and all involved staff had been tested for the virus and all were negative. One patient (0.7%) reported transient cough and sore throat, and the remaining 141 (99.3%) patients and 11 (100%) staff did not develop symptoms. Conclusions: Low risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the ophthalmic setting was observed when universal safety measures such as social distancing, meticulous hand hygiene, enlarged breath shields, and mask wear during procedures were taken."

8752,Immunity to SARS-CoV-2: Lessons Learned.,"In the year since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and with understanding of the etiology of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it has become clear that most infected individuals achieve some form of immunity against the virus with relatively few reported reinfections. A number of vaccines have already achieved emergency use authorization based on data from large phase 3 field efficacy clinical trials. However, our knowledge about the extent and durability of this immunity, and the breadth of vaccine coverage against SARS-CoV-2 variants is still evolving. In this narrative review, we summarize the latest and rapidly developing understanding of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including what we have learned about the key antigens of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain), their importance in vaccine development, the immediate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, breadth of coverage of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, contributions of preexisting immunity to related coronaviruses, and duration of immunity. We also discuss lessons from newer approaches, such as systems serology, that provide insights into molecular and cellular immune responses elicited and how they relate to the trajectory of infection, and potentially inform immune correlates of protection. We also briefly examine the limited research literature on immune responses in special populations, such as pregnant women and children."

8755,Postmortem Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasopharyngeal Mucosa.,"Analyses of infection chains have demonstrated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is highly transmissive. However, data on postmortem stability and infectivity are lacking. Our finding of nasopharyngeal viral RNA stability in 79 corpses showed no time-dependent decrease. Maintained infectivity is supported by virus isolation up to 35 hours postmortem."
8756,Coronavirus Disease 2019 Suspicion: A Case Report Regarding a Male Emergency Medical Service Pilot With Newly Diagnosed Sarcoidosis.,"A 38-year-old emergency medical service Bell 214 male pilot with a dry cough, fever, anorexia, fatigue, and sweating for the past 3 days; an oral temperature of 38°C; blood pressure of 105/65 mm Hg; heart rate of 94 beats/min; respiratory rate of 21 breaths/min; and pulse oximetry of 93% on room air was suspicious for coronavirus disease 2019. Surprisingly, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was negative, but bilateral hilar adenopathy was reported in his chest radiography as a new challenge. The pathologic report of the adenopathy biopsy was noncaseating sarcoid-type granulomas. Serologic tests showed a serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level of 58 nmol/mL/min. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid CD4/CD8 ratio was 3.68. The bronchoalveolar lavage findings provided an accurate sarcoidosis diagnosis, and a high-resolution computed tomographic scan revealed stage 1 pulmonary involvement. Because of the pulmonary involvement, clinical manifestations, use of inhaled fluticasone, and need for longer and accurate follow-up and to protect against coronavirus disease 2019, he has been temporarily suspended until the final assignment."
8757,Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Systems Pharmacology in Drug Prevention and Treatment against COVID-19.,"A novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 is causing the severe acute pneumonia (COVID-19) and rapid spread nationally and internationally, resulting in a major global health emergency. Chinese governments and scientists have implemented a series of rigorous measures and scientific research to prevent and control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is still no specific antiviral drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. It has been proven that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) exerts an important role in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak. Although the therapeutic effects of these TCM formulas are attractive, the molecular mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. An emerging strategy of systems pharmacology has been proposed to be a promising method to interpret drug action in complex biological systems and quickly screen out the bioactive compounds from TCM to treat treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, in this study, the epidemiology, TCM therapy, and the systems pharmacology-based method for TCM are reviewed for COVID-19 to provide a perspective for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further efforts should be made to reduce disease burden and improve the ability to design antiviral drugs and vaccines, which will benefit the health care system, economic development and even social stability."
