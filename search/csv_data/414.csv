4130,Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in Pakistan among health care workers.,"Objective: Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine will impart a pivotal role in eradicating the virus. In Pakistan, health care workers (HCWs) are the first group to receive vaccination. This survey aimed at the level of acceptance to the COVID-19 vaccine and predictors of non-acceptance in HCWs. Method: This was a cross-sectional study design and data were collected through 3rd December 2020 and February 14th, 2021. An English questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms and administration of affiliate hospitals along with snowball sampling for private hospitals. Results: Out of 5,237 responses, 3,679 (70.2%) accepted COVID-19 vaccination and 1,284 (24.5%) wanted to delay until more data was available. Only 5.2% of HCWs rejected being vaccinated. Vaccine acceptance was more in young (76%) and female gender (63.3%) who worked in a tertiary care hospital (51.2%) and were direct patient care providers (61.3%). The reason for rejection in females was doubtful vaccine effectiveness (31.48%) while males rejected due to prior COVID-19 exposure (42.19%) and side effect profile of the vaccine (33.17%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated age between 51-60 years, female gender, Pashtuns, those working in the specialty of medicine and allied, taking direct care of COVID-19 patients, higher education, and prior COVID-19 infection as the predictors for acceptance or rejection of COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: In conclusion, this survey suggests that early on in a vaccination drive, majority of the HCWs in Pakistan are willing to be vaccinated and only a small number of participants would actually reject being vaccinated."
4131,Perspectives on vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.,"As the novel SARS-CoV-2 continues to infect numerous individuals worldwide, one of the leading approaches in dealing with the global health crisis is vaccination against the COVID-19. Due to recent reports, vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca) may result in a vaccine-induced catastrophic thrombotic thrombocytopenia disorder. Thus, as of March 16 of 2021, vaccination programs in 18 countries had been suspended until further examination, including Sweden, Germany and France. This disorder presents as extensive thrombosis in atypical sites, primarily in the cerebral venous, alongside thrombocytopenia and the production of autoantibody against platelet-factor 4 (PF4). PF4 autoantibody has the ability to binds the human FcRÎ³IIA receptor of platelets and contribute to their aggregation. This rare adverse effect extremely resembles the clinical presentation of the classical immune-mediated HIT disorder, which occurs following exposure to heparin. Surprisingly, none of these patients had been pre-exposed to heparin before disease onset, leading to the hypothesis that a viral antigen from the vaccine had triggered the response. Importantly, COVID-19 had been associated with numerous autoimmune manifestations, including the production of pathogenic autoantibodies, new onset of autoimmune diseases and disorders. As the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination leads to the synthesis of specific SARS-CoV-2-proteins, they may trigger a production of PF4 autoantibody though molecular mimicry phenomena, while vaccination compounds lead to a rigorous bystander activation of immune cells. If existing, removing such homological sequences from the vaccine may eliminate this phenomenon. In contrast, it needs to be emphasized that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was found to be safe and efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19 in randomized controlled trials, which included 23,848 participants from the UK, Brazil and South Africa."

4133,A Discrete Event Simulation-Based Model to Optimally Design and Dimension Mobile COVID-19 Saliva-Based Testing Stations.,"The present COVID-19 brief report addresses: (1) the problem of optimal design and resource allocation to mobile testing stations to ensure rapid results to the persons getting tested; (2) the proposed solution through a newly developed discrete event simulation model, experienced in on-campus saliva-based testing stations at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and (3) the lessons learned on how 10,000 samples (from noninvasive polymerase chain reaction COVID-19 tests) can be processed per day on campus, as well as how the model could be reused or adapted to other contexts by site managers and decision makers."
4134,"Rapid, label-free, and sensitive point-of-care testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG using all-fiber Fresnel reflection microfluidic biosensor.","The ongoing global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has promoted to develop novel serological testing technologies since they can be effectively complementary to RT-PCR. Here, a new all-fiber Fresnel reflection microfluidic biosensor (FRMB) was constructed through combining all-fiber optical system, microfluidic chip, and multimode fiber bio-probe. The transmission of the incident light and the collection and transmission of Fresnel reflection light are achieved using a single-multi-mode fiber optic coupler (SMFC) without any other optical separation elements. This compact design greatly simplifies the whole system structure and improves light transmission efficiency, which makes it suitable for the label-free, sensitive, and easy-to-use point-of-care testing (POCT) of targets in nanoliter samples. Based on Fresnel reflection mechanism and immunoassay principle, both the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be sensitively quantified in 7 min using the secondary antibodies-modified multimode fiber bio-probe. The FRMB performs in one-step, is accurate, label-free, and sensitive in situ/on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG in serum with simple dilution only. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and SARS-CoV-2 IgG were 0.82 ng/mL and 0.45 ng/mL, respectively. Based on our proposed theory, the affinity constants of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibody and their respective secondary antibodies were also determined. The FRMB can be readily extended as a universal platform for the label-free, rapid, and sensitive in situ/on-site measurement of other biomarkers and the investigation of biomolecular interaction."
4135,Perceptions on undertaking regular asymptomatic self-testing for COVID-19 using lateral flow tests: a qualitative study of university students and staff.,"Objectives: Successful implementation of asymptomatic testing programmes using lateral flow tests (LFTs) depends on several factors, including feasibility, acceptability and how people act on test results. We aimed to examine experiences of university students and staff of regular asymptomatic self-testing using LFTs, and their subsequent behaviours. Design and setting: A qualitative study using semistructured remote interviews and qualitative survey responses, which were analysed thematically. Participants: People who were participating in weekly testing feasibility study, between October 2020 and January 2021, at the University of Oxford. Results: We interviewed 18 and surveyed 214 participants. Participants were motivated to regularly self-test as they wanted to know whether or not they were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most reported that a negative test result did not change their behaviour, but it did provide them with reassurance to engage with permitted activities. In contrast, some participants reported making decisions about visiting other people because they felt reassured by a negative test result. Participants valued the training but some still doubted their ability to carry out the test. Participants were concerned about safety of attending test sites with lots of people and reported home testing was most convenient. Conclusions: Clear messages highlighting the benefits of regular testing for family, friends and society in identifying asymptomatic cases are needed. This should be coupled with transparent communication about the accuracy of LFTs and how to act on either a positive or negative result. Concerns about safety, convenience of testing and ability to do tests need to be addressed to ensure successful scaling up of asymptomatic testing."
4136,"PIMS-TS, the New Paediatric Systemic Inflammatory Disease Related to Previous Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Infection-""Rheumatic Fever"" of the 21st Century?","Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (PIMS-TS) is a new systemic inflammatory disease that mainly affects children. Its course in many features resembles that of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Therefore, it is interesting that the experiences with ARF can be used in the management of patients with PIMS-TS. The aim of the article is to analyse the current data on PIMS-TS in relation to ARF. PIMS-TS and ARF are associated with an abnormal immune response to specific pathogens (SARS-CoV-2 and group A streptococcus, respectively). The main symptoms of both diseases are fever and cardiac involvement. Current therapy for PIMS-TS is based on anti-inflammatory treatment: intravenous immunoglobulin (first-line), intravenous glucocorticoids (second-line), or biological therapy (third-line; including interleukin [IL]-1 antagonists, IL-6 receptor blockers, and anti-tumour necrosis factor agents). Vaccination might be good prophylaxis, but the efficacy and safety of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been established in children. Interesting insights may be gained by considering PIMS-TS in light of what is known of ARF due to their similar courses, but there are still many unanswered questions surrounding this disease and its pathogenesis."
4137,"""The Risk Seems Too High"": Thoughts and Feelings about COVID-19 Vaccination.","The purpose of this study was to describe the thoughts and feelings of individuals expressing concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted in order to examine the thoughts and feelings of participants who are hesitant about the COVID-19 vaccine. Data were collected from 754 participants using an online instrument. Emergent themes included a lack of knowledge about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine; concerns over the speed of development, testing, and approval of these vaccines; reluctance to be among the first vaccinated; concerns about the motivations of government actors, pharmaceutical companies, and others involved in producing the COVID-19 vaccine; and hesitancy about vaccines generally."
4138,Effect of Arrival Quarantine on Subsequent COVID-19 Testing in a Cohort of Military Basic Trainees.,"Introduction: Basic Military Training at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland implemented several sequential non-pharmaceutical interventions in response to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). One measure, arrival quarantine, has not been studied as a modern military disease prevention strategy. This study aimed to determine the effect of a 14-day arrival quarantine on symptomatic COVID-19 testing. Material and methods: A retrospective cohort study compared symptomatic COVID-19 testing among all trainees who entered Basic Military Training between March 17, 2020, and April 17, 2020, before the implementation of universal arrival COVID-19 testing, during their first 2 weeks in arrival quarantine compared to the rest of their training. Furthermore, symptomatic COVID-19 testing in the last 5 weeks of training in those who completed arrival quarantine was compared to testing in the last 5 weeks for trainees who arrived between February 16, 2020, and March 16, 2020, and did not undergo arrival quarantine. Nominal variables were compared by chi-square test, and continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. This study was approved as a public health surveillance project by the 59th Medical Wing Institutional Review Board. Results: Five thousand five hundred and seventy-six trainees started training between February 16, 2020, and April 17, 2020, with 2,573 trainees undergoing an arrival quarantine compared to 3,003 trainees who did not. Trainees who underwent arrival quarantine had higher rates of COVID-19 testing while in arrival quarantine (10.5 tests per 1,000 trainee-weeks vs. 2.3, P â¤ .001) and higher rates of concomitant influenza testing (74% vs. 38%, P = .001) compared to after they completed quarantine. Trainees that completed quarantine had less symptomatic COVID-19 testing after day 14 of training (2.3 tests per 1,000 trainee-weeks vs. 14.3, P â¤ .001) and influenza testing (38% vs. 74%, P = .001) compared to trainees that did not undergo arrival quarantine. Conclusion: Arrival quarantine appears to be an effective non-pharmaceutical intervention associated with fewer symptomatic COVID-19 tests, especially after completion of quarantine."
4139,COVID-19 vaccines and treatments nationalism: Challenges for low-income countries and the attainment of the SDGs.,"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (AfSD) has the vision to leave no one behind, particularly low-income countries. Yet COVID-19 seems to have brought up new rules and approaches. Through document and critical discourse analysis, it emerges that there has been a surge in COVID-19 vaccines and treatments nationalism. Global solidarity is threatened, with the USA, United Kingdom, European Union and Japan having secured 1.3 billion doses of potential vaccines as of August 2020. Vaccines ran out even before their approval with three candidates from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca having shown good Phase III results in November 2020. Rich countries have gone years ahead in advance vaccines and treatments purchases. This is a testimony that the 2030 AfSD, especially SDG 3 focusing on health will be difficult to achieve. Low-income countries are left gasping for survival as the COVID-19 pandemic relegates them further into extreme poverty and deeper inequality. The paper recommends the continued mobilisation by the World Health Organisation and other key stakeholders in supporting the GAVI vaccine alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (COVAX) global vaccines initiative that seeks to make two billion vaccine doses available to 92 low and middle-income countries by December 2021."
