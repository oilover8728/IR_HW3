9790,Network neighbors of viral targets and differentially expressed genes in COVID-19 are drug target candidates.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is raging. It revealed the importance of rapid scientific advancement towards understanding and treating new diseases. To address this challenge, we adapt an explainable artificial intelligence algorithm for data fusion and utilize it on new omics data on viral-host interactions, human protein interactions, and drugs to better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and predict new drug-target interactions for COVID-19. We discover that in the human interactome, the human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the genes that are differentially expressed after the infection have common neighbors central in the interactome that may be key to the disease mechanisms. We uncover 185 new drug-target interactions targeting 49 of these key genes and suggest re-purposing of 149 FDA-approved drugs, including drugs targeting VEGF and nitric oxide signaling, whose pathways coincide with the observed COVID-19 symptoms. Our integrative methodology is universal and can enable insight into this and other serious diseases."
9791,"Multifunctional angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, and critical appraisal of its role in acute lung injury.","The recent emergence of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic affecting millions of individuals has raised great concern throughout the world, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent for COVID-19. The multifunctional protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is accepted as its primary target for entry into host cells. In its enzymatic function, ACE2, like its homologue ACE, regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) critical for cardiovascular and renal homeostasis in mammals. Unlike ACE, however, ACE2 drives an alternative RAS pathway by degrading Ang-II and thus operates to balance RAS homeostasis in the context of hypertension, heart failure, and cardiovascular as well as renal complications of diabetes. Outside the RAS, ACE2 hydrolyzes key peptides, such as amyloid-β, apelin, and [des-Arg9]-bradykinin. In addition to its enzymatic functions, ACE2 is found to regulate intestinal amino acid homeostasis and the gut microbiome. Although the non-enzymatic function of ACE2 as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 has been well established, the contribution of enzymatic functions of ACE2 to the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related lung injury has been a matter of debate. A complete understanding of this central enzyme may begin to explain the various symptoms and pathologies seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and may aid in the development of novel treatments for COVID-19."
9792,Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein/ACE2 Protein-Protein Interactions: a Computational Study.,"The spike glycoprotein (S) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus surface plays a key role in receptor binding and virus entry. The S protein uses the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) for entry into the host cell and binding to ACE2 occurs at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Therefore, the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2, could be attractive therapeutic targets for drug discovery approaches designed to inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. Herein, with the support of machine learning approaches, we report structure-based virtual screening as an effective strategy to discover PPIs inhibitors from ZINC database. The proposed computational protocol led to the identification of a promising scaffold which was selected for subsequent binding mode analysis and that can represent a useful starting point for the development of new treatments of the SARS-CoV-2 infection."

9794,The Mystery of MIS-C Post-SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Following emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a surge in the life-threatening illness now termed 'multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children' (MIS-C) has raised questions about the unique effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children and adolescents. Two important new studies by Consiglio et al. and Gruber et al. have begun to shine light on the immune drivers of this enigmatic disease."
9795,Translational control of coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses represent a large family of enveloped RNA viruses that infect a large spectrum of animals. In humans, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic and is genetically related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively. All viruses described to date entirely rely on the protein synthesis machinery of the host cells to produce proteins required for their replication and spread. As such, virus often need to control the cellular translational apparatus to avoid the first line of the cellular defense intended to limit the viral propagation. Thus, coronaviruses have developed remarkable strategies to hijack the host translational machinery in order to favor viral protein production. In this review, we will describe some of these strategies and will highlight the role of viral proteins and RNAs in this process."
9796,"Rural Health Care for Coronavirus Requires Collaboration, Creativity.","Before the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) started sweeping across the United States, it began on the coasts. The first known case was reported in a county just outside of Seattle, WA, with other cases quickly cropping up in California and in the greater New York City region. As the virus lingered on the periphery of the country, doctors and physicians working in inland, rural communities worried about what might happen if the virus hit their homes."
9797,Diabetes and COVID-19; a Review of Possible Mechanisms.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19) has recently raised worldwide public health concerns. The available data on COVID-19 in patients with diabetes is limited but generally indicate that there is an increased risk of developing COVID-19 infection in diabetic patients, which ultimately impacts the overall patient's survival. Various aspects might be involved; however, the exact mechanisms and interrelationships between diabetes and the novel COVID-19 have not yet been fully elucidated. This review summarizes the possible mechanisms by which present diabetes predispose individuals to COVID-19 infection, modulates the hostviral interactions and increases the risk of mortality. We hope this review can provide beneficial information for further studies and contribute to improved disease management of diabetic patients with COVID-19."
9798,Real-time RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis: challenges and prospects.,"COVID-19 impacts global public health, economy, education, tourism/hospitality and sports; rapid and accurate testing of clinical samples dictate effective response. So far, the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the assay of choice for COVID-19 diagnosis considering its rapidity and accuracy in informing on active coronavirus (CoV) infection. Presently, several RT-qPCR protocols with differing sensitivity/specificity are used for performing this assay; some of them are known to have generated debatable test results to constitute challenges worthy of consideration. This review provides a critical assessment of various published works on RT-qPCR assays used for COVID-19 diagnosis with their different indicators of positivity i.e., cycle threshold (Ct) cut-off values. Knowledge of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 is still evolving and, as a prospect, underscores the need for local validation of positive-negative Ct cut-off values when establishing RT-qPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection."
9799,"Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152: a double-blind, randomised, phase 1 trial.","Background: To mitigate the effects of COVID-19, a vaccine is urgently needed. BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG) or alum (Algel). Methods: We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152 at 11 hospitals across India. Healthy adults aged 18-55 years who were deemed healthy by the investigator were eligible. Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one of three vaccine formulations (3 μg with Algel-IMDG, 6 μg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 μg with Algel) or an Algel only control vaccine group. Block randomisation was done with a web response platform. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered on day 0 (the day of randomisation) and day 14. Primary outcomes were solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events at 2 h and 7 days after vaccination and throughout the full study duration, including serious adverse events. Secondary outcome was seroconversion (at least four-fold increase from baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated by intracellular staining and ELISpot. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04471519). Findings: Between July 13 and 30, 2020, 827 participants were screened, of whom 375 were enrolled. Among the enrolled participants, 100 each were randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups, and 75 were randomly assigned to the control group (Algel only). After both doses, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported by 17 (17%; 95% CI 10·5-26·1) participants in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group, 21 (21%; 13·8-30·5) in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group, 14 (14%; 8·1-22·7) in the 6 μg with Algel group, and ten (10%; 6·9-23·6) in the Algel-only group. The most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain (17 [5%] of 375 participants), headache (13 [3%]), fatigue (11 [3%]), fever (nine [2%]), and nausea or vomiting (seven [2%]). All solicited adverse events were mild (43 [69%] of 62) or moderate (19 [31%]) and were more frequent after the first dose. One serious adverse event of viral pneumonitis was reported in the 6 μg with Algel group, unrelated to the vaccine. Seroconversion rates (%) were 87·9, 91·9, and 82·8 in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG, 6 μg with Algel-IMDG, and 6 μg with Algel groups, respectively. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in a subset of 16 participants from both Algel-IMDG groups. Interpretation: BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are warranted. Funding: Bharat Biotech International."
