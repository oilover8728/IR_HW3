8580,Determinants of Influenza Vaccine Uptake in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease and Strategies for Improvement.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Influenza infection is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure exacerbation) and mortality, and all-cause mortality in patients with CVD. Infection with influenza leads to a systemic inflammatory and thrombogenic response in the host body, which further causes destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. Influenza vaccination has been shown to be protective against cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in several observational and prospective studies of at-risk populations. Hence, many international guidelines recommend influenza vaccination for adults of all ages, especially for individuals with high-risk conditions such as CVD. Despite these long-standing recommendations, influenza vaccine uptake among US adults with CVD remains suboptimal. Specifically, vaccination uptake is strikingly low among patients aged <65 years, non-Hispanic Black individuals, those without health insurance, and those with diminished access to healthcare services. Behavioral factors such as perceived vaccine efficacy, vaccine safety, and attitudes towards vaccination play an important role in vaccine acceptance at the individual and community levels. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is a potential threat of a concurrent epidemic with influenza. This would be devastating for vulnerable populations such as adults with CVD, further stressing the need for ensuring adequate influenza vaccination coverage. In this review, we describe a variety of strategies to improve the uptake of influenza vaccination in patients with CVD through improved understanding of key sociodemographic determinants and behaviors that are associated with vaccination, or the lack thereof. We further discuss the potential use of relevant strategies for COVID-19 vaccine uptake among those with CVD."
8581,Reactive arthritis after COVID-19 vaccination.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a global spread. Vaccines play an essential role in preventing the spread. However, almost all types of vaccines have been reported to be associated with adverse events. Reactive arthritis (ReA) after vaccination has been reported; however, ReA after COVID-19 vaccination has not been reported. We reported a 23-year-old woman who suffered from an acute ReA on her left knee joint after COVID-19 vaccination and discussed the etiology and preventive strategy. She presented with swollen, painful left knee joint for 18 d. She had been inoculated 0.5 ml CoronaVac vaccine on 0 d and the 14th day with deltoid intramuscular injection. Finally, she was diagnosed as ReA after CoronaVac vaccination and was administered a single intra-articular injection of 1 ml compound betamethasone. The swelling and pain nearly disappeared after 2 d. On 1month follow-up, her condition was normal. ReA after COVID-19 vaccination is rare. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh its potential risks and vaccination should be administered according to the current recommendations. Further attentions should be put to determine which individual is at higher risk for developing autoimmune diseases after COVID-19 vaccination. More versatile and safer vaccines should be explored."
8582,Prolonged Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in an Obstetric Patient With Antibody Seroconversion.,"Background: There is a growing understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the general population. The unique immunology of pregnancy may result in variations from the reported course of disease. Case: A 27-year-old primigravid woman presented with mild COVID-19 symptoms at 28 2/7 weeks of gestation, testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Antibody seroconversion was detected at 36 6/7 weeks of gestation. She presented for delivery at 38 1/7 weeks of gestation, and her SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result was positive. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA remained detectable 34 days postpartum and 104 days from her initial positive test. Conclusion: Prolonged viral shedding of SARS-CoV RNA may occur in the pregnant patient. If prevalent, this complicates the interpretation of a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result in the asymptomatic gravid patient."
8583,Stabilization of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain Using Deep Mutational Scanning and Structure-Based Design.,"The unprecedented global demand for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has demonstrated the need for highly effective vaccine candidates that are thermostable and amenable to large-scale manufacturing. Nanoparticle immunogens presenting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) in repetitive arrays are being advanced as second-generation vaccine candidates, as they feature robust manufacturing characteristics and have shown promising immunogenicity in preclinical models. Here, we used previously reported deep mutational scanning (DMS) data to guide the design of stabilized variants of the RBD. The selected mutations fill a cavity in the RBD that has been identified as a linoleic acid binding pocket. Screening of several designs led to the selection of two lead candidates that expressed at higher yields than the wild-type RBD. These stabilized RBDs possess enhanced thermal stability and resistance to aggregation, particularly when incorporated into an icosahedral nanoparticle immunogen that maintained its integrity and antigenicity for 28 days at 35-40°C, while corresponding immunogens displaying the wild-type RBD experienced aggregation and loss of antigenicity. The stabilized immunogens preserved the potent immunogenicity of the original nanoparticle immunogen, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Our findings may improve the scalability and stability of RBD-based coronavirus vaccines in any format and more generally highlight the utility of comprehensive DMS data in guiding vaccine design."
8584,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 invasion in the central nervous system: a host-virus deadlock.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) devastation on the central nervous system (CNS) is ascertained by the present clinical findings and the noticeable signs and symptoms. The CNS involvement of the virus is not trivial; although the brain has highly protective systems, the virus has ways to breach them with a destructive potential. For successful entry of the virus, different possible routes with favorable mechanisms are used. The SARS-CoV-2 invasion induces a mechanism of both the innate and adaptive immune response to control virus replication and removal from the CNS tissues. The cytokine storm and autoimmune response during the immunological events result in demyelination, damage of resident cells and neurons, cerebrovascular thrombosis, and dysregulation of neuro signaling pathways. Furthermore, hypoxia and toxemia accelerate the neurological destruction process. The acute attributions on psychology due to inflammation is a hallmark of CNS involved pathogenesis; nevertheless, the productivity, durability, and longevity of virus-specific lymphocytes are the vital indicators for complete removal of viral antigen and in combat against reinfection of the CNS. Keywords: CNS invasion; immune response; cytokine storm; demyelination; mental status."
8585,Breakthrough: Chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China. Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China. The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future."
8586,Ligand-based approach for predicting drug targets and for virtual screening against COVID-19.,"Discovering efficient drugs and identifying target proteins are still an unmet but urgent need for curing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Protein structure-based docking is a widely applied approach for discovering active compounds against drug targets and for predicting potential targets of active compounds. However, this approach has its inherent deficiency caused by e.g. various different conformations with largely varied binding pockets adopted by proteins, or the lack of true target proteins in the database. This deficiency may result in false negative results. As a complementary approach to the protein structure-based platform for COVID-19, termed as D3Docking in our previous work, we developed in this study a ligand-based method, named D3Similarity, which is based on the molecular similarity evaluation between the submitted molecule(s) and those in an active compound database. The database is constituted by all the reported bioactive molecules against the coronaviruses, viz., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC), human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), some of which have target or mechanism information but some do not. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) similarity evaluation of molecular structures, virtual screening and target prediction could be performed according to similarity ranking results. With two examples, we demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of D3Similarity by using 2D × 3D value as score for drug discovery and target prediction against COVID-19. The database, which will be updated regularly, is available free of charge at https://www.d3pharma.com/D3Targets-2019-nCoV/D3Similarity/index.php."
8587,Using Influenza Vaccination Location Data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to Expand COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage.,"Effective COVID-19 vaccine distribution requires prioritizing locations that are accessible to high-risk target populations. However, little is known about the vaccination location preferences of individuals with underlying chronic conditions. Using data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we grouped 162,744 respondents into high-risk and low-risk groups for COVID-19 and analyzed the odds of previous influenza vaccination at doctor's offices, health departments, community settings, stores, or hospitals. Individuals at high risk for severe COVID-19 were more likely to be vaccinated in doctor's offices and stores and less likely to be vaccinated in community settings."
