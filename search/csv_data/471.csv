4701,Vaccination of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases against SARS-CoV-2: considerations before widespread availability of the vaccines.,"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has become available and will hopefully end the current pandemic. Understandably, patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (iRMDs) and their physicians are feverishly preoccupied with questions about vaccination and the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, as it will take months before all patients with iRMDs will have access to the vaccines, measures that are taken now in order to increase potential safety and efficacy of the vaccines may impose a risk for the patients with regard to reactivation of their underlying iRMD. The ad hoc commission 'Covid-19' and the board of directors of the German Society for Rheumatology have addressed this topic and have developed considerations, which are intended to answer urgent questions, to take away concerns and fears and to make initial recommendations for patients with iRMDs."
4702,Pre-Procedural COVID-19 Nasopharyngeal Swab Has Good Concordance with Bronchoalveolar Lavage in Patients at Low Risk for Viral Infection.,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically affected hospital and operating room (OR) workflow around the world as well as trainee education. Many institutions have instituted mandatory preoperative SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasopharyngeal swab (NS) testing in patients who are low risk for COVID-19 prior to elective cases. This method, however, is challenging as the sensitivity, specificity, and overall reliability of testing remains unclear. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the concordance of a negative NS in low risk preoperative patients with lower airway bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens obtained from the same patients. Methods: We prospectively sent intraoperative lower airway BAL samples collected within 48 h of a negative mandatory preoperative NS for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. All adult patients undergoing a scheduled bronchoscopic procedure for any reason were enrolled, including elective and nonelective cases. Results: One-hundred eighty-nine patients were included. All BAL specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 indicative of 100% concordance between testing modalities. Conclusions: These results are promising and suggest that preoperative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 testing provides adequate screening to rule out active COVID-19 infection prior to OR cases in a population characterized as low risk by negative symptom screening. This information can be used for both pre-procedural screening and when reintroducing trainees into the workforce."

The emergence of sporadic cases of anaphylaxis following vaccination with these new compounds and the identification of PEGs (polyethylenglycols) as potential, widely used but yet usually unknown culprits have led to uncertainty among treating physicians and patients. The aim of this article series is to summarize current available pathophysiological and clinical information (part 1), to describe the characteristics of the vaccines (part 2) and to provide practical solutions for diagnosis and treatment of potential allergy against mRNACovid19 vaccines."
4704,Ultra-rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in public workspace environments.,"Managing the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 requires new capabilities in testing, including the possibility of identifying, in minutes, infected individuals as they enter spaces where they must congregate in a functioning society, including workspaces, schools, points of entry, and commercial business establishments. Here, the only useful tests (a) require no sample transport, (b) require minimal sample manipulation, (c) can be performed by unlicensed individuals, (d) return results on the spot in much less than one hour, and (e) cost no more than a few dollars. The sensitivity need not be as high as normally required by the FDA for screening asymptomatic carriers (as few as 10 virions per sample), as these viral loads are almost certainly not high enough for an individual to present a risk for forward infection. This allows tests specifically useful for this pandemic to trade-off unneeded sensitivity for necessary speed, simplicity, and frugality. In some studies, it was shown that viral load that creates forward-infection risk may exceed 105 virions per milliliter, easily within the sensitivity of an RNA amplification architecture, but unattainable by antibody-based architectures that simply target viral antigens. Here, we describe such a test based on a displaceable probe loop amplification architecture."
4705,Multisectoral Approach on COVID-19 vaccination: a proposed solution on vaccine hesitancy.,"As COVID-19 cases rise in one of Southeast Asia's worst-hit nations, low public trust in vaccines will be a huge block in the government's vaccination program. In a recent survey in January 2021 which was conducted by Pulse Asia, nearly half of Filipinos said that they would not get vaccinated against COVID-19 due to safety concerns. A proposed solution would be a Multisectoral Approach (MSA). MSA refers to the deliberate collaboration among various stakeholder groups (e.g. government, civil society and private and religious sectors) and sectors (e.g. health, environment and economy) to achieve a policy outcome. By engaging multiple sectors, such as interfaith collaborations, governments can leverage knowledge, expertise, reach and resources, benefiting from their combined and varied strengths as they work toward the shared goal of building public trust on vaccines."
4706,Quantifying Covid19-vaccine location strategies for Germany.,"Background: Vaccines are an important tool to limit the health and economic damage of the Covid-19 pandemic. Several vaccine candidates already provided promising effectiveness data, but it is crucial for an effective vaccination campaign that people are willing and able to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Taking Germany as an example, we provide insights of using a mathematical approach for the planning and location of vaccination sites to optimally administer vaccines against Covid-19. Methods: We used mathematical programming for computing an optimal selection of vaccination sites out of a given set (i.e., university hospitals, health department related locations and general practices). Different patient-to-facility assignments and doctor-to-facility assignments and different constraints on the number of vaccinees per site or maximum travel time are used. Results: In order to minimize the barriers for people to get vaccinated, i.e., limit the one-way travel journey (airline distance) by around 35 km for 75% of the population (with a maximum of 70 km), around 80 well-positioned facilities can be enough. If only the 38 university hospitals are being used, the 75% distance increases to around 50 km (with a maximum of 145 km). Using all 400 health departments or all 56 000 general practices can decrease the journey length significantly, but comes at the price of more required staff and possibly wastage of only partially used vaccine containers. Conclusions: In the case of free assignments, the number of required physicians can in most scenarios be limited to 2 000, which is also the minimum with our assumptions. However, when travel distances for the patients are to be minimized, capacities of the facilities must be respected, or administrative assignments are prespecified, an increased number of physicians is unavoidable."

4708,"COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness among the staff of the Bologna Health Trust, Italy, December 2020-April 2021.","Background and aim: Randomized controlled trials have shown that mRNA vaccines are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV2 infection. We conducted a study to assess the real-world effectiveness of mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) in preventing all and symptomatic SARS-CoV2 infections and COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the staff of the Bologna Health Trust (HT), Italy Methods: We followed up retrospectively 9839 staff of the Bologna HT from December 27, 2020 to April 3, 2020 and calculated the effectiveness in partially and fully vaccinated subjects by applying a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. Results: Vaccine effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV2 infections is 85.5% (95%CI: 75.9-91.3) in the partially vaccinated and 84.8% (95%CI: 73.2-91.4) in the fully vaccinated. In preventing symptomatic infection effectiveness is 81.7% (95%CI: 62.7-91.0) in the partially and 87.1% (95%CI: 69.3-94.6) in the fully vaccinated. There were no COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the partially or fully vaccinated vs 15 hospitalization in the unvaccinated cohort. Conclusions: Our results confirm the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in a real-world setting in Northern Italy."
