8431,Overview of transnational recommendations for COVID-19 transmission control in dental care settings.,"On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic. Until an effective treatment or a vaccine is developed, the current recommendations are to contain the disease, and control its transmission. It is now clear that the primary mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is aerosol/droplet spread, and by contacting virus-contaminated surfaces acting as fomites (inanimate vectors). Furthermore, recent data indicate that the live virus particles are present in saliva, and, more alarmingly, asymptomatic individuals may transmit the infection. By virtue of the nature of the practice of dentistry where intrinsically, a high volume of aerosols is produced, as well as the close proximity of dentists and patients during treatment, dentists and allied health staff are considered the highest risk health professional group for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 during patient management. Therefore, several organizations and specialty associations have proposed guidelines and recommendations for limiting the transmission of SARS-COV-2 from carriers to dentists and vice versa. This paper aims to provide a review of these guidelines, and concludes with a brief look at how the practice of dentistry may be impacted by COVID-19, in the post-pandemic era."
8432,Preparation for Quarantine on the Cruise Ship Diamond Princess in Japan due to COVID-19.,"Background: Japan implemented a large-scale quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in an attempt to control the spread of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in February 2020. Objective: We aim to describe the medical activities initiated and difficulties in implementing quarantine on a cruise ship. Methods: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed for all 3711 people (2666 passengers and 1045 crew) on board. Results: Of those tested, 696 (18.8%) tested positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), of which 410 (58.9%) were asymptomatic. We also confirmed that 54% of the asymptomatic patients with a positive RT-PCR result had lung opacities on chest computed tomography. There were many difficulties in implementing quarantine, such as creating a dividing traffic line between infectious and noninfectious passengers, finding hospitals and transportation providers willing to accept these patients, transporting individuals, language barriers, and supporting daily life. As of March 8, 2020, 31 patients (4.5% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) were hospitalized and required ventilator support or intensive care, and 7 patients (1.0% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) had died. Conclusions: There were several difficulties in implementing large-scale quarantine and obtaining medical support on the cruise ship. In the future, we need to prepare for patients' transfer and the admitting hospitals when disembarking the passengers. We recommend treating the crew the same way as the passengers to control the infection. We must also draw a plan for the future, to protect travelers and passengers from emerging infectious diseases on cruise ships."

8436,Disentangling the dynamical underpinnings of differences in SARS-CoV-2 pathology using within-host ecological models.,"Health outcomes following infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are remarkably variable. The way the virus spreads inside hosts, and how this spread interacts with host immunity and physiology, is likely to determine variation in health outcomes. Decades of data and dynamical analyses of how other viruses spread and interact with host cells could shed light on SARS-CoV-2 within-host trajectories. We review how common axes of variation in within-host dynamics and emergent pathology (such as age and sex) might be combined with ecological principles to understand the case of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight pitfalls in application of existing theoretical frameworks relevant to the complexity of the within-host context and frame the discussion in terms of growing knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Viewing health outcomes for SARS-CoV-2 through the lens of ecological models underscores the value of repeated measures on individuals, especially since many lines of evidence suggest important contingence on trajectory."
8437,Trials for second generation Covid-19 vaccines: Revisiting the debate over placebo use in developing country clinical trials.,"This article compares the current debate over the use of placebos in developing country clinical trials of second generation Covid-19 vaccines with the debates over previous paradigmatic cases raising similar issues. Compared to the earlier zidovudine and Surfaxin trials, Covid-19 vaccine trials are likely to confer lower risk to placebo groups and to offer a greater number and variety of alternative study designs. However, turning to the developing world to conduct studies that would be unacceptable in developed countries, simply on the ground that Covid-19 vaccines are generally unavailable in developing countries, is not ethically justifiable. This is so whether the justification is rooted in total absence of vaccine in a given country or in developing country vaccine prioritisation practices, because at root both derive from economic, not scientific conditions. However, the advent of variants that may create genuine uncertainty as to comparator vaccine effectiveness could justify a placebo control, depending on vaccine characteristics, variant prevalence, the degree of variant resistance, and the acceptability of immune-bridging studies. These factors must be considered together in the necessary case-by-case assessment of the ethical justification for any proposed trial."
8438,"COVID-19 hospitalisation, mortality, vaccination, and postvaccination trends among people with schizophrenia in Israel: a longitudinal cohort study.","Background: Individuals with schizophrenia have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, nonetheless, no previous study has provided a year-long account of this risk, or assessed postvaccination trends in this population. This study assessed temporal trends in COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality among people with schizophrenia during the first year of the pandemic, the predictors for COVID-19 vaccination, postvaccination infection, admission to hospital, and mortality. Methods: In this longitudinal cohort study, people with schizophrenia (n=25 539) and controls (n=25 539) were assessed for COVID-19 outcomes before and after vaccination, up to April 30, 2021. Cox proportional hazard regression models and Kaplan-Meier analyses were done to assess longitudinal trends. The study used the databases of Clalit Health Services, the largest health-care organisation in Israel. Findings: The sample included 51 078 participants, of which 31 141 (61·0%) male and 19 937 (39·0%) female participants, with a mean age of 51·94 years (SD 15·62). Most of the sample was from the general Jewish population (75·9%), followed by the Arab (19·1%) and Jewish Ultraorthodox population (5·1%). Overall of 51 078 individuals, 356 (0·7%) people had been hospitalised, 133 (0·3%) had died, and a total of 27 400 (53·6%) had been vaccinated. People with schizophrenia showed a higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalisation (HR 4·81, 95% CI 3·57-6·48, p<0·0001) and mortality (HR 2·52, 95% CI 1·64-3·85, p<0·0001), and showed a sharper decline in survival as time progressed. The control group showed a sharper incline in probability to vaccinate (log-rank=309·88, p<0·0001). Medical comorbidity of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, or ischaemic heart disease played a significant role in predicting vaccination rates in the schizophrenia group (all p<0·0001), but not in the control group. Hospitalisation and mortality disparities remained higher among people with schizophrenia who had not been vaccinated in comparison to controls (incidence rate difference of 6·2 and 3·2, respectively) but substantially declined in fully vaccinated groups (incidence rate difference of 1·1 and -0·9, respectively). Interpretation: People with schizophrenia have higher hospitalisation and mortality risk, yet have lower rates of vaccination than in the general population. Disparities in COVID-19 severe outcomes can be substantially reduced by national vaccination plans aimed at actively reaching out to people with schizophrenia. Funding: No funding."
8439,Willingness to Use Home Collection Methods to Provide Specimens for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Research: Survey Study.,"Background: Innovative laboratory testing approaches for SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response are needed to conduct research to establish estimates of prevalence and incidence. Self-specimen collection methods have been successfully used in HIV and sexually transmitted infection research and can provide a feasible opportunity to scale up SARS-CoV-2 testing for research purposes. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of adults to use different specimen collection modalities for themselves and children as part of a COVID-19 research study. Methods: Between March 27 and April 1, 2020, we recruited 1435 adults aged 18 years or older though social media advertisements. Participants completed a survey that included 5-point Likert scale items stating how willing they were to use the following specimen collection testing modalities as part of a research study: home collection of a saliva sample, home collection of a throat swab, home finger-prick blood collection, drive-through site throat swab, clinic throat swab, and clinic blood collection. Additionally, participants indicated how the availability of home-based collection methods would impact their willingness to participate compared to drive-through and clinic-based specimen collection. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman rank correlations to assess if willingness to use each testing modality differed by demographic variables and characteristics of interest. We compared the overall willingness to use each testing modality and estimated effect sizes with Cohen d. Results: We analyzed responses from 1435 participants with a median age of 40.0 (SD=18.2) years and over half of which were female (761/1435, 53.0%). Most participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to use specimens self-collected at home to participate in research, including willingness to collect a saliva sample (1259/1435, 87.7%) or a throat swab (1191/1435, 83.1%). Willingness to collect a throat swab sample was lower in both a drive-through setting (64%) and clinic setting (53%). Overall, 69.0% (990/1435) of participants said they would be more likely to participate in a research study if they could provide a saliva sample or throat swab at home compared to going to a drive-through site; only 4.4% (63/1435) of participants said they would be less likely to participate using self-collected samples. For each specimen collection modality, willingness to collect specimens from children for research was lower than willingness to use on oneself, but the ranked order of modalities was similar. Conclusions: Most participants were willing to participate in a COVID-19 research study that involves laboratory testing; however, there was a strong preference for home specimen collection procedures over drive-through or clinic-based testing. To increase participation and minimize bias, epidemiologic research studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response should consider home specimen collection methods."
