2570,"Urgent care center wait times increase for COVID-19 results in August 2020, with rapid testing availability limited.","Background: In a response to the pandemic, urgent care centers (UCCs) have gained a critical role as a common location for COVID-19 testing. We sought to characterize the changes in testing accessibility at UCCs between March and August 2020 on the basis of testing availability (including rapid antigen testing), wait time for test results, cost of visits, and cost of tests. Methods: Data were collected using a secret shopper methodology. Researchers contacted 250 UCCs in 10 states. Investigators used a standardized script to survey centers on their COVID-19 testing availability and policies. UCCs were initially contacted in March and re-called in August. T-tests and chi-square tests were conducted to identify differences between March and August data and differences by center classification. Results: Our results indicate that both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect COVID-19 genetic material and rapid antigen COVID-19 tests have increased in availability. However, wait times for PCR test results have significantly increased to an average of 5.79 days. Additionally, a high proportion of UCCs continue to charge for tests and visits and no significant decrease was found in the proportion of UCCs that charge for COVID-19 testing from March to August. Further, no state reported a majority of UCCs with rapid testing available, indicating an overall lack of rapid testing. Conclusions: From March to August, COVID-19 testing availability gradually improved. However, many barriers lie in access to COVID-19 testing, including testing costs, visit costs, and overall lack of availability of rapid testing in the majority of UCCs. Despite the passage of the CARES Act, these results suggest that there is room for additional policy to improve accessibility to testing, specifically rapid testing."
2571,Emerging biosensing technologies for improved diagnostics of COVID-19 and future pandemics.,"Diagnostic tools play significant roles in the fight against COVID-19 and other pandemics. Existing tests, such as RT-qPCR, have limitations including long assay time, low throughput, inadequate sensitivity, and suboptimal portability. Emerging biosensing technologies hold the promise to develop tests that are rapid, highly sensitive, and suitable for point-of-care testing, which could significantly facilitate the testing of COVID-19. Despite that, practical applications of such biosensors in pandemics have yet to be achieved. In this review, we consolidate the newly developed diagnostic tools for COVID-19 using emerging biosensing technologies and discuss their application promise. In particular, we present nucleic acid tests and antibody tests of COVID-19 based on both conventional and emerging biosensing methods. We then provide perspectives on the existing challenges and potential solutions."
2572,SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test: Fast-safe or dangerous? An analysis in the emergency department of an university hospital.,"The use of Antigen point of care tests (AgPOCT) might be an essential tool to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Manufacturer information indicates a specificity of about 95% and there is a growing interest to use these tests area-wide. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify whether AgPOCT can be used safely for ""rule-in"" (detection of positive patients) and for ""rule-out"" (valid negative testing). Two thousand three hundred and seventy-five patients received polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and AgPOCT for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) regardless of symptoms. The positive predictive value of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was compared with a cut-off threshold cycle (C t ) value of ≤30 and in total. Five hundrded and fifty-one patients tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR, of whom 35.2% presented without symptoms. In all patients, regardless of their symptoms or C t values, a sensitivity of 68.9% and a specificity of 99.6% were calculated for AgPOCT. In patients with C t values ≤30, a sensitivity of 80.5% (95% confidence interval: ±1.62) and a specificity of 99.6% were shown for all tests (symptomatic/asymptomatic). Highly infectious patients (C t ≤ 20), regardless of symptoms, were reliably detected by the AgPOCT. In infectious patients with C t values ≤30, the test has a sensitivity of about 80% regardless of COVID-19 typical symptoms, which is apparently less than the 96.52% specificity indicated by the manufacturer. Relevant improvement in test sensitivity by querying the patients who are symptomatic and asymptomatic is also not feasible. We strongly suggest that we critically question the use of AgPOCT for ""rule-out,"" as they only provide a supposed safety."
2573,The role and significance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 peptides in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019.,"Since the end of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) posed a serious threat to human health and life. Therefore, the discovery of drugs that can effectively prevent and treat COVID-19 is urgently warranted. In this article, the role and significance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in drug development and the treatment of COVID-19 are discussed. It was found that the binding of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2-RBD involved two core regions (31st and 353rd lysine) and 20 amino acids of the ACE2 protein. The mutation of these amino acids could lead to a great change of the binding ability of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-RBD. This information was important for us to find more efficient ACE2 peptides to block the 2019-nCoV infection. So during this study, we summarized the role of ACE2 in the regulation of 2019-nCoV infection and stress, and hypothesized that the development and optimization of ACE2 peptide can effectively block 2019-nCoV infection and reliably treat the COVID-19."

2577,Treatment and control strategies for COVID-19: Prospects and possibilities.,"COVID-19 is a highly contagious and infectious disease, spreading rapidly worldwide. Its high spread rate has turned it into public stigma. The current study is focusing on its treatment and control strategies on the basis of the facts and figs obtained from previous studies. Supplementation of infected person with minerals and vitamin would be very beneficial for faster recovery like in any other acute viral infection. Blood of a recovered person in any outbreak is very precious because it is containing high levels of neutralizing antibodies, memory T and B cells population. Both serum and buffy coat fractions of the blood will helpful for treatment as well as prophylaxis. The S proteins (spike) of SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV 1 have 70% similarity so the vaccine available for SARS would also be effective for COVID-19. Besides this, genome of SARS CoV 2 has been sequenced successfully and it is quite easy for the scientists to prepare DNA based vaccines and peptide-based subunit vaccines targeting the S protein of the virus. To control the spread of COVID-19, various disinfectant and antiseptics are very useful. The virus is also susceptible to heat, low pH and UV light so hot climatic conditions are also lethal to this virus."

2579,Making sense of spike D614G in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has evolved to adapt to human host and transmission over the past 12 months. One prominent adaptive mutation is the asparagine-to-glycine substitution at amino acid position 614 in the viral spike protein (D614G), which has become dominant in the currently circulating virus strains. Since spike protein determines host ranges, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis through binding to the cellular receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the D614G mutation is hypothesized to enhance viral fitness in human host, leading to increased transmission during the global pandemic. Here we summarize the recent progress on the role of the D614G mutation in viral replication, pathogenesis, transmission, and vaccine and therapeutic antibody development. These findings underscore the importance in closely monitoring viral evolution and defining their functions to ensure countermeasure efficacy against newly emerging variants."
