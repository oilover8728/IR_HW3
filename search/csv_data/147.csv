1460,"Performance and operational feasibility of antigen and antibody rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in Cameroon: a clinical, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study.","Background: Real-time PCR is recommended to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, PCR availability is restricted in most countries. Rapid diagnostic tests are considered acceptable alternatives, but data are lacking on their performance. We assessed the performance of four antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests and one antigen-based rapid diagnostic test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community in Cameroon. Methods: In this clinical, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled individuals aged at least 21 years who were either symptomatic and suspected of having COVID-19 or asymptomatic and presented for screening. We tested peripheral blood for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Innovita (Biological Technology; Beijing, China), Wondfo (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech; Guangzhou, China), SD Biosensor (SD Biosensor; Gyeonggi-do, South Korea), and Runkun tests (Runkun Pharmaceutical; Hunan, China), and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using the SD Biosensor test. Antigen rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Abbott PCR testing (Abbott; Abbott Park, IL, USA), and antibody rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Biomerieux immunoassays (Biomerieux; Marcy l'Etoile, France). We retrospectively tested two diagnostic algorithms that incorporated rapid diagnostic tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using simulation modelling. Findings: 1195 participants were enrolled in the study. 347 (29%) tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, 223 (19%) rapid diagnostic test antigen-positive, and 478 (40%) rapid diagnostic test antibody-positive. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic test sensitivity was 80·0% (95% CI 71·0-88·0) in the first 7 days after symptom onset, but antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests had only 26·8% sensitivity (18·3-36·8). Antibody rapid diagnostic test sensitivity increased to 76·4% (70·1-82·0) 14 days after symptom onset. Among asymptomatic participants, the sensitivity of antigen-based and antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests were 37·0% (27·0-48·0) and 50·7% (42·2-59·1), respectively. Cohen's κ showed substantial agreement between Wondfo antibody rapid diagnostic test and gold-standard ELISA (κ=0·76; sensitivity 0·98) and between Biosensor and ELISA (κ=0·60; sensitivity 0·94). Innovita (κ=0·47; sensitivity 0·93) and Runkun (κ=0·43; sensitivity 0·76) showed moderate agreement. An antigen-based retrospective algorithm applied to symptomatic patients showed 94·0% sensitivity and 91·0% specificity in the first 7 days after symptom onset. For asymptomatic participants, the algorithm showed a sensitivity of 34% (95% CI 23·0-44·0) and a specificity of 92·0% (88·0-96·0). Interpretation: Rapid diagnostic tests had good overall sensitivity for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rapid diagnostic tests could be incorporated into efficient testing algorithms as an alternative to PCR to decrease diagnostic delays and onward viral transmission.

1461,Virosome-based nanovaccines; a promising bioinspiration and biomimetic approach for preventing viral diseases: A review.,"Vaccination is the most effective means of controlling infectious disease-related morbidity and mortality. However, due to low immunogenicity of viral antigens, nanomedicine as a new opportunity in new generation of vaccine advancement attracted researcher encouragement. Virosome is a lipidic nanomaterial emerging as FDA approved nanocarriers with promising bioinspiration and biomimetic potency against viral infections. Virosome surface modification with critical viral fusion proteins is the cornerstone of vaccine development. Surface antigens at virosomes innovatively interact with targeted receptors on host cells that evoke humoral or cellular immune responses through antibody-producing B cell and internalization by endocytosis-mediated pathways. To date, several nanovaccine based on virosome formulations have been commercialized against widespread and life-threatening infections. Recently, Great efforts were made to fabricate a virosome-based vaccine platform against a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Thus, this review provides a novel overview of the virosome based nanovaccine production, properties, and application on the viral disease, especially its importance in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine discovery."

1463,Epidemiological Features of 105 Patients Infected with the COVID-19.,"Objective: To investigate and evaluate the clinical features of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outside of Wuhan. Methods: 105 patients admitted to our hospital with clinical- and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were studied. Data were collected from January 17, 2020 to March 5, 2020. Results: 105 patients (57 male and 48 female) were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. Among the 105 patients, 55 (52%) had made short trips to Wuhan during the two weeks before the onset of illness, and these were the first-generation confirmed cases. An exact date of close contact with someone in Wenzhou with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection from Wuhan (the second-generation confirmed cases) could be provided by 38 (36%) patients. Of the remaining patients, six (6%; the third-generation confirmed cases) were familial clusters of the second-generation confirmed cases, three (3%) had no definite epidemiological features, and 16 (15%) were from the same location as for the case report. Conclusion: Due to the infectiousness of COVID-19, patients with infections should be diagnosed and treated as early as possible after developing fever symptoms or showing other clinical characteristics or imaging features. With respect to high-risk cases, we must focus on any complications that arise and take effective measures to treat them immediately. This will significantly improve the prognosis of patients with severe infections."
1464,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and associated factors in healthcare workers: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a high-risk population for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Aim: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs, and identify the factors associated with this seroprevalence. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were applied for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including PubMed/MEDLINE and preprint services (medRχiv and bioRχiv) were searched from inception to 24th August 2020. Findings: Forty-nine studies including 127,480 HCWs met the inclusion criteria. The estimated overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs was 8.7% (95% confidence interval 6.7-10.9%). Seroprevalence was higher in studies conducted in North America (12.7%) compared with those conducted in Europe (8.5%), Africa (8.2) and Asia (4%). Meta-regression showed that increased sensitivity of antibody tests was associated with increased seroprevalence. The following factors were associated with seropositivity: male gender; Black, Asian and Hispanic HCWs; work in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) unit; patient-related work; front-line HCWs; healthcare assistants; shortage of personal protective equipment; self-reported belief of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection; previous positive polymerase chain reaction test; and household contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs is high. Excellent adherence to infection prevention and control measures; sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment; and early recognition, identification and isolation of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 are imperative to decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
1465,Are Seroprevalence Estimates for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Biased?,Biased seroprevalence estimates can occur using serological assays optimized with validation sets unrepresentative of disease spectrum in the general population. Correct interpretation of serosurveys for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requires quantifying variations in sensitivity with disease severity and over time.
1466,The success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and challenges ahead.,"The rapid and remarkably successful development, manufacture, and deployment of several effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines is now tempered by three key challenges. First, reducing virus transmission will require prevention of asymptomatic and mild infections in addition to severe symptomatic infections. Second, the emergence of variants of concern with mutations in the S protein's receptor binding domain increases the likelihood that vaccines will have to be updated because some of these mutations render variants less optimally targeted by current vaccines. This will require coordinated global SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to link genotypes to phenotypes, potentially using the WHO's global influenza surveillance program as a guide. Third, concerns about the longevity of vaccine-induced immunity highlight the potential need for re-vaccination, depending on the extent to which the virus has been controlled and whether re-vaccination can target those at greatest risk of severe illness. Fortunately, as I discuss in this review, these challenges can be addressed."
1467,Usefulness of bronchoalveolar lavage in the management of patients presenting with lung infiltrates and suspect COVID-19-associated pneumonia: A case report.,"Objective: To report a clinical case of a patient with a compatible HRCT scan and two negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA upper respiratory tract specimens but with a confirmed viral infection by BAL (19 days after symptom onset). Methods: Revision of a patient's clinical charts with COVID-19 admitted at INMI L. Spallanzani Hospital RESULTS: Two oropharyngeal swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were performed at admission (17 days from symptoms onset) and a day apart and were found negative. BAL fluid collected 19 days after symptoms onset was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: This case highlights importance of clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in diagnosis and infectivity assessment. We suggest collection of BAL fluid when consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs are negative, to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Healthcare workers should perform aerosol-generating procedures in an adequately ventilated room and should wear adequate PPE."
1468,Abrupt Late-onset Psychosis as a Presentation of Coronavirus 2019 Disease (COVID-19): A Longitudinal Case Report.,"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 Coronavirus (SARS-2-CoV). Although most prominently associated with pulmonary manifestations, COVID-19 is increasingly implicated in neuropsychiatric complications, including delirium and psychosis. There is a potential causal link between COVID-19 infection and psychotic symptoms; however, case reports to date have been incomplete, as the patients described had known psychiatric histories or other plausible medical causes for altered mental status. We present a longitudinal case of COVID-19 psychosis in a patient who underwent comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. This case is a contribution to the inchoate characterization of neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 infection. Case report: We present a case of late-onset psychosis in a middle-aged man with no psychiatric history who tested positive for COVID-19 on admission following a recently resolved upper respiratory illness. His acute presentation-characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thought and behavior, for which he required inpatient medical admission and subsequent inpatient psychiatric hospitalization-was successfully treated. During his hospitalization, he underwent comprehensive medical and neurological workup (including neuroimaging; electroencephalography; and serum and cerebrospinal fluid testing) that was grossly unremarkable. Discussion: Despite myriad potential causes of the patient's psychosis, this patient's diagnostic workup was largely unrevealing, apart from his nasopharyngeal SARS-2-CoV reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. As such, psychosis secondary to COVID-19 infection emerged as the presumptive diagnosis."
