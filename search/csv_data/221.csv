2201,Structure-guided T cell vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2 variants and sarbecoviruses.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that escape convalescent and vaccine-induced antibody responses has renewed focus on the development of broadly protective T-cell-based vaccines. Here, we apply structure-based network analysis and assessments of HLA class I peptide stability to define mutationally constrained CD8+ T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Highly networked residues are conserved temporally among circulating variants and sarbecoviruses and disproportionately impair spike pseudotyped lentivirus infectivity when mutated. Evaluation of HLA class I stabilizing activity for 18 globally prevalent alleles identifies CD8+ T cell epitopes within highly networked regions with limited mutational frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and deep-sequenced primary isolates. Moreover, these epitopes elicit demonstrable CD8+ T cell reactivity in convalescent individuals but reduced recognition in recipients of mRNA-based vaccines. These data thereby elucidate key mutationally constrained regions and immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome for a global T-cell-based vaccine against emerging variants and SARS-like coronaviruses."
2202,Performing point-of-care molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 with RNA extraction and isothermal amplification.,"To respond to the urgent need for COVID-19 testing, countries perform nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in centralized laboratories. Real-time RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction), used to amplify and detect the viral RNA., is considered, as the current gold standard for diagnostics. It is an efficient process, but the complex engineering required for automated RNA extraction and temperature cycling makes it incompatible for use in point of care settings [1]. In the present work, by harnessing progress made in the past two decades in isothermal amplification and paper microfluidics, we created a portable test, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA is extracted, amplified isothermally by RT-LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), and detected using intercalating dyes or fluorescent probes. Depending on the viral load in the tested samples, the detection takes between twenty minutes and one hour. Using a set of 16 pools of naso-pharyngal swab eluates, we estimated a limit of detection comparable to real-time RT-PCR (i.e. 1 genome copies per microliter of clinical sample) and no cross-reaction with eight major respiratory viruses currently circulating in Europe. We designed and fabricated an easy-to-use portable device called ""COVIDISC"" to carry out the test at the point of care. The low cost of the materials along with the absence of complex equipment will expedite the widespread dissemination of this device. What is proposed here is a new efficient tool to help managing the pandemics."

2207,Introduction of the BNT162b2 vaccine during a COVID-19 nursing home outbreak.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks often occur in nursing homes and prompt frequent surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2. A single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine reduces viral load and transmission. In this study, we describe the real-world efficacy of BNT162b2 single-dose vaccination during a COVID-19 outbreak at a Veterans Affairs Community Living Center (CLC). Methods: From 12/2/20 to 5/14/21, twice weekly antigen testing was used to detect COVID-19 among 146 residents at the CLC. Residents without a prior history of COVID-19 who agreed to immunization were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine on 12/16/20 and 1/6/21. Single-dose vaccine efficacy was determined for days 1-21 and days 14-21 after the first vaccine dose. Results: The outbreak occurred from 12/2/20 to 1/7/21 with an attack rate of 30.8% (45/146); 46.7% (21/45) of the cases were due to asymptomatic COVID-19. One unit accounted for 77.8% (35/45) of the cases. In the vaccine analysis, 116 residents were a median age of 74.5 years and 93.1% (108/116) had â‰¥ 1 comorbid condition. Between the first and second dose, 15.5% (15/97) of vaccinated residents, and 21.2% (4/19) of unvaccinated residents developed COVID-19 (P = .81). One week after the second dose, no cases of COVID-19 occurred. Conclusions: Albeit limited by the small numbers, a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was not efficacious at preventing COVID-19 during this nursing home outbreak."
2208,The prevalence of COVID-19 in healthcare personnel in an adult and pediatric academic medical center.,"Background: It is vital to know which healthcare personnel (HCP) have a higher chance of testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted at Stanford Children's Health (SCH) and Stanford Health Care (SHC) in Stanford, California. Analysis included all HCP, employed by SCH or SHC, who had a COVID-19 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test resulted by the SHC Laboratory, between March 1, 2020 and June 15, 2020. The primary outcome was the RT-PCR percent positivity and prevalence of COVID-19 for HCP and these were compared across roles. Results: SCH and SHC had 24,081 active employees, of which 142 had at least 1 positive COVID-19 test. The overall HCP prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.59% and percent positivity was 1.84%. Patient facing HCPs had a significantly higher prevalence (0.66% vs 0.43%; P = .0331) and percent positivity (1.95% vs 1.43%; P = .0396) than nonpatient facing employees, respectively. Percent positivity was higher in food service workers (9.15%), and environmental services (5.96%) compared to clinicians (1.93%; P < .0001) and nurses (1.46%; P < .0001), respectively. Discussion and conclusion: HCP in patient-facing roles and in support roles had a greater chance of being positive of COVID-19."
