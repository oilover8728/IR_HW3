2450,Safety and immunogenicity of an mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 : A phase 1 randomized clinical trial.,"Background: We used the RNActive® technology platform (CureVac N.V., Tübingen, Germany) to prepare CVnCoV, a COVID-19 vaccine containing sequence-optimized mRNA coding for a stabilized form of SARS-CoV‑2 spike (S) protein encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). Methods: This is an interim analysis of a dosage escalation phase 1 study in healthy 18-60-year-old volunteers in Hannover, Munich and Tübingen, Germany, and Ghent, Belgium. After giving 2 intramuscular doses of CVnCoV or placebo 28 days apart we assessed solicited local and systemic adverse events (AE) for 7 days and unsolicited AEs for 28 days after each vaccination. Immunogenicity was measured as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV‑2 S‑protein and receptor binding domain (RBD), and SARS-CoV‑2 neutralizing titers (MN50). Results: In 245 volunteers who received 2 CVnCoV vaccinations (2 μg, n = 47, 4 μg, n = 48, 6 μg, n = 46, 8 μg, n = 44, 12 μg, n = 28) or placebo (n = 32) there were no vaccine-related serious AEs. Dosage-dependent increases in frequency and severity of solicited systemic AEs, and to a lesser extent local AEs, were mainly mild or moderate and transient in duration. Dosage-dependent increases in IgG antibodies to S‑protein and RBD and MN50 were evident in all groups 2 weeks after the second dose when 100% (23/23) seroconverted to S‑protein or RBD, and 83% (19/23) seroconverted for MN50 in the 12 μg group. Responses to 12 μg were comparable to those observed in convalescent sera from known COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: In this study 2 CVnCoV doses were safe, with acceptable reactogenicity and 12 μg dosages elicited levels of immune responses that overlapped those observed in convalescent sera."
2451,Evaluation of the rapid antigen test CerTest SARS-CoV-2 as an alternative COVID-19 diagnosis technique.,
2452,Evaluating the efficiency of specimen (sample) pooling for real-time PCR based diagnosis of COVID-19.,"Purpose: This study is aims at evaluating the efficacy and sensitivity of specimen pooling for testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus to determine the accuracy, resource savings, and identification of borderline positive cases without impacting the accuracy of the testing. Method: This study was conducted between August and October 2020, we performed COVID-19 testing by RT-PCR on the samples from varying prevalence of rural population (non-hot spot) referred to COVID laboratory, in the first step, the samples were collated into pools of 5 or 10. These pools were tested by RT-PCR. Negative pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 were then de-convoluted and each sample was tested individually. Results: In the present study, we tested 1580 samples in 158 pools of 10 and 17,515 samples in 3503 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool, 11 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 11 pools (110 samples) de-convoluted strategy was followed in which 10 individual samples came positive. Among 5 samples pool, 164 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 164 pools (820 samples) de-convoluted strategy was followed in which 171 individual samples came positive. The pooled sample testing strategy saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76%-93% fewer tests in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. Conclusion: Pooled sample RT- PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison with individual testing without compromising the quality of outcome of the test. In particular, the pooled sample approach can facilitate mass screening in the early asymptomatic stages of COVID-19 infections."
2453,Contact-adjusted Immunity Levels against SARS-CoV-2 in Korea and Prospects for Achieving Herd Immunity.,"The proportion of population vaccinated cannot be directly translated into the herd immunity. We have to account for the age-stratified contact patterns to calculate the population immunity level, since not every individual gathers evenly. Here, we calculated the contact-adjusted population immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in South Korea using age-specific incidence and vaccine uptake rate. We further explored options to achieve the theoretical herd immunity with age-varying immunity scenarios. As of June 21, 2021, when a quarter of the population received at least one dose of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, the contact-adjusted immunity level was 12.5% under the social distancing level 1. When 80% of individuals aged 10 years and over gained immunity, we could achieve a 58.2% contact-adjusted immunity level. The pros and cons of vaccinating children should be weighed since the risks of COVID-19 for the young are less than the elderly, and the long-term safety of vaccines is still obscure."
2454,Successful treatment of acute spleno-porto-mesenteric vein thrombosis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. A case report.,"Several cases of deep venous thrombosis in people who had recently received Vaxzevria (previously known as COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) have recently been reported, mainly presenting as cerebral vein/cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. This syndrome has been termed ""vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)"". Acute spleno-porto-mesenteric vein thrombosis is an uncommon but serious condition with potential sequelae, such as small-bowel gangrene and end-stage liver failure. We describe a case of concomitant thrombosis of portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins in a young female patient with no other risk factors who received Vaxzevria (previously ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, AstraZeneca) 17 days before. The diagnostic workup and the successful endovascular treatment and systemic anticoagulation management is reported."
2455,The COVID-19 pandemic: key considerations for the epidemic and its control.,"The response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by draconian measures and far too many important unknowns, such as the true mortality risk, the role of children as transmitters and the development and duration of immunity in the population. More than a year into the pandemic much has been learned and insights into this novel type of pandemic and options for control are shaping up. Using a historical lens, we review what we know and still do not know about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A pandemic caused by a member of the coronavirus family is a new situation following more than a century of influenza A pandemics. However, recent pandemic threats such as outbreaks of the related and novel deadly coronavirus SARS in 2003 and of MERS since 2012 had put coronaviruses on WHOs blueprint list of priority diseases. Like pandemic influenza, SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible (R0 ~ 2.5). Furthermore, it can fly under the radar due to a broad clinical spectrum where asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infected persons also transmit the virus-including children. COVID-19 is far more deadly than seasonal influenza; initial data from China suggested a case fatality rate of 2.3%-which would have been on par with the deadly 1918 Spanish influenza. But, while the Spanish influenza killed young, otherwise healthy adults, it is the elderly who are at extreme risk of dying of COVID-19. We review available seroepidemiological evidence of infection rates and compute infection fatality rates (IFR) for Denmark (0.5%), Spain (0.85%), and Iceland (0.3%). We also deduce that population age structure is key. SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by superspreading, so that ~10% of infected individuals yield 80% of new infections. This phenomenon turns out to be an Achilles heel of the virus that may explain our ability to effectively mitigate outbreaks so far. How will this pandemic come to an end? Herd immunity has not been achieved in Europe due to intense mitigation by non-pharmaceutical interventions; for example, only ~8% of Danes were infected across the 1st and 2nd wave. Luckily, we now have several safe and effective vaccines. Global vaccine control of the pandemic depends in great measure on our ability to keep up with current and future immune escape variants of the virus. We should thus be prepared for a race between vaccine updates and mutations of the virus. A permanent reopening of society highly depends on winning that race."
2456,Effects of SARS-CoV-2 on Cardiovascular System: The Dual Role of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the Virus Receptor and Homeostasis Regulator-Review.,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) in humans. ACE-2 is a type I transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase expressed in vascular endothelial cells, alveolar type 2 lung epithelial cells, renal tubular epithelium, Leydig cells in testes and gastrointestinal tract. ACE2 mediates the interaction between host cells and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. However, ACE2 is not only a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, but it has also an important homeostatic function regulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is pivotal for both the cardiovascular and immune systems. Therefore, ACE2 is the key link between SARS-CoV-2 infection, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and immune response. Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 seems to be tightly associated with ACE2 availability, which in turn is determined by genetics, age, gender and comorbidities. Severe COVID-19 is due to an uncontrolled and excessive immune response, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. In spite of a lower ACE2 expression on cells surface, patients with CVDs have a higher COVID-19 mortality rate, which is likely driven by the imbalance between ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) protein (which is required for cleavage of ACE-2 ectodomain resulting in increased ACE2 shedding), and TMPRSS2 (which is required for spike glycoprotein priming). To date, ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) treatment interruption in patients with chronic comorbidities appears unjustified. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines provides opportunities to study the effects of different COVID-19 vaccines on ACE2 in patients on treatment with ACEi/ARB."
2457,D614G Spike Mutation Increases SARS CoV-2 Susceptibility to Neutralization.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the pandemic that confers greater infectivity and is now the globally dominant form. To determine whether D614G might also mediate neutralization escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates, and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 spike. In all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization. The G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by receptor-binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera from people infected with either form of the virus. Negative stain electron microscopy revealed a higher percentage of the 1-RBD ""up"" conformation in the G614 spike, suggesting increased epitope exposure as a mechanism of enhanced vulnerability to neutralization. Based on these findings, the D614G mutation is not expected to be an obstacle for current vaccine development."
2458,"Perioperative Medical and Surgical Coronavirus Disease 2019 Issues: Keeping Surgeons, Operating Room Teams, and Patients Safe.","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over 22 million people in the United States (US) and has had a devastating impact on the US economy and healthcare system. In order to help slow the spread of the virus and save hospital resources, nonessential businesses were forced to close and elective surgeries have been postponed. Methods: As we reach the peak of the pandemic and the COVID-19 vaccine gets distributed, healthcare systems must develop plans to safely resume elective surgeries. This article outlines a single center academic medical center's perioperative COVID-19 protocol to help keep surgeons, operating room teams, and patients safe. Results: While testing protocols can help minimize the transmission of the virus, there is still the potential for COVID+ patients to undergo surgery undetected, due to potential false negative tests and the long incubation period before seroconversion and symptom development. Conclusions: An effective institutional strategy not only includes clear perioperative testing protocols, but also education regarding clinical manifestations and exposure control."
2459,Intranasal ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 vaccination reduces viral shedding after SARS-CoV-2 D614G challenge in preclinical models.,"ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 is an approved adenovirus-based vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) currently being deployed globally. Previous studies in rhesus macaques revealed that intramuscular vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 provided protection against pneumonia but did not reduce shedding of SARS-CoV-2 from the upper respiratory tract. Here, we investigated whether intranasally administered ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 reduces detection of virus in nasal swabs after challenging vaccinated macaques and hamsters with SARS-CoV-2 carrying a D614G mutation in the spike protein. Viral loads in swabs obtained from intranasally vaccinated hamsters were decreased compared to control hamsters, and no viral RNA or infectious virus was found in lung tissue after a direct challenge or after direct contact with infected hamsters. Intranasal vaccination of rhesus macaques resulted in reduced virus concentrations in nasal swabs and a reduction in viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and lower respiratory tract tissue. Intranasal vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 reduced virus concentrations in nasal swabs in two different SARS-CoV-2 animal models, warranting further investigation as a potential vaccination route for COVID-19 vaccines."
