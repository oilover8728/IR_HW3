6880,"Health Literacy, Digital Health Literacy, and COVID-19 Pandemic Attitudes and Behaviors in U.S. College Students: Implications for Interventions.","The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by rapidly emerging evidence, changing guidance, and misinformation, which present new challenges for health literacy (HL) and digital health literacy (DHL) skills. This study explored whether COVID-19-related information access, attitudes, and behaviors were associated with health literacy and digital health literacy among college students in the United States. Self-reported measures of health literacy, along with items on pandemic-related attitudes, behaviors, information sources, and social networks, were collected online using a managed research panel. In July 2020, 256 responses were collected, which mirrored the racial/ethnic and gender diversity of U.S. colleges. Only 49% reported adequate HL, and 57% found DHL tasks easy overall. DHL did not vary by HL level. In multivariable models, both HL and DHL were independently associated with overall compliance with basic preventive practices. Higher DHL, but not HL, was significantly associated with greater willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine and the belief that acquiring the disease would negatively impact their life. On average, respondents discussed health with 4-5 people, which did not vary by HL or DHL measures. The usage of online information sources varied by HL and DHL. The study findings can inform future student-focused interventions, including identifying the distinct roles of HL and DHL in pandemic information access, attitudes, and behaviors."
6881,COVID-19: Nasal and oropharyngeal swab.,"Performing a proper nasal and oropharyngeal swab procedure is essential in the screening of COVID-19 infection. The video illustration of nasal and oropharyngeal swab is presented (Video S1). To correctly perform the nasopharyngeal swab, the patient must be seated comfortably with the back of their head against the headrest. The swab is inserted in the nose horizontally, along an imaginary line between the nostril and the ear. Oropharyngeal sampling is easier to perform. The swab is directed toward the rear wall of the oropharynx and it is rotated a few times before removal. After taking the sample, it is necessary to insert both swabs in the same tube, breaking the rod with one swift and controlled movement. Finally, carefully reset the cap. It appears to be extremely important to properly collect nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs in order to minimize the false negative rate among COVID-19 positive patients."
6882,Outcomes of Patients with Sarcoma and COVID-19 Infection: A Single Institution Cohort Analysis.,Outcomes for patients (pts) with sarcoma and COVID-19 are unknown. This is a single institution retrospective study of adults with sarcoma and COVID-19. Ten pts [median age 60 (range 24-69)] were identified. Five were hospitalized; two died from COVID-19 complications; another died from sarcoma. Time between last systemic treatment dose and COVID-19 diagnosis was 6-41 days in pts who died. 5 underwent prior radiation (RT); time between RT and COVID-19 diagnosis was 20-62 days for pts who died. All three pts with WBC differential data (two died) were lymphopenic. Efforts to capture outcomes for a larger cohort are urgently needed.
6883,"Current Status of Multiple Drug Molecules, and Vaccines: An Update in SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutics.","The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease that has taken the lives of many around the world. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, the USA, Italy, Spain, France, Russia, and the UK have been hit the hardest by the virus. However, death counts are still rising. Some nations have managed to ""flatten"" the death rate via protective measures such physical distancing, quarantine measures, and therapeutic management. The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus comprises of S proteins, M proteins, E proteins, hemagglutinin esterases, nucleocapsid proteins, and a 30-kb RNA genome. Viral proteases cleave these polyproteins and RNA-dependent polymerases replicate the genome. Currently, there are no effective therapies against this new disease. Numerous investigators are developing novel protease inhibitors, some of which have made it into clinical trials. Researchers are also attempting to develop a vaccine. In this review paper, we discuss the latest therapeutic developments against COVID-19. Graphical Abstract."
6884,SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic healthcare workers of the emergency department in a tertiary care facility.,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a high-risk category during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crisis, with frontline HCWs at emergency departments (EDs) may be at an even higher risk. Determining the spread of infection among HCWs may have implications for infection control policies in hospitals. This study aimed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among asymptomatic HCWs of the ED of a large tertiary center in Cairo, Egypt. Methods: The study was conducted from June 1st to June 14th, 2020. All the recommended national and international indications on infection control measures were followed. Two hundred and three HCWs were included in the study and tested by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and rapid serological test (RST). Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data. Results: Of the 203 HCWs, 29 (14.3 %) tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thirty-seven (18.2 %) HCWs tested positive with RST: 20 with both IgM and IgG; 14 with IgM only, and 3 with IgG only. Age, gender, and/or occupation were not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Point prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic HCWs in ED of tertiary care facility is 14.3 % by RT-PCR. This illustrates the importance of screening all HCWs regardless of symptoms, and the need for strict measures in securing HCWs to reduce transmission from healthcare facilities to the community during the current pandemic."
6885,Potential interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with human cell receptors in the skin: Understanding the enigma for a lower frequency of skin lesions compared to other tissues.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a new public health problem, with a total of 10.577.263 documented COVID-19 cases worldwide and 513.441 deaths up to the present date. Few cases of disease-related cutaneous manifestations have been reported in the literature, and such manifestations are scarce. Integumentary manifestations from COVID-19 include exanthemas and papular dermatoses, urticarial eruptions, atopic dermatitis, vesiculobullous lesions and skin signs of hypercoagulable states, such as acral ischaemia, livedo and retiform purpura. Most common extracutaneous manifestations from the disease include headache, cough, anosmia, ageusia, fever, dyspnoea, nausea, diarrhoea and cardiovascular events. The objectives of this review were to discuss the role of human cell receptors described as interaction targets of SARS-CoV-2, as well to understand the current state of knowledge on skin expression of these receptors, in order to substantiate future research. The authors present a thorough literature review on SARS-CoV-2 and its possible interaction with cell receptors and human tissues including the skin. They discuss a molecular hypothesis to explain the lower prevalence of dermatological manifestations from direct SARS-CoV-2 infection. Distinct human cell receptors binding the virus appear to be less expressed in the skin compared to other organs. Additionally, the presence of resolvins and the disintegrin metalloprotease ADAM17 provide a putative protection to the skin, explaining the majority of COVID-19 manifestations to be extracutaneous. This review represents an excellent opportunity for future studies using skin biopsies from COVID-19 patients to investigate molecular expression in the pathophysiology of cutaneous manifestations of the disease."

6887,What Is the Role of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing in Discontinuation of Transmission-based Precautions for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients?,
6888,Dried SARS-CoV-2 virus maintains infectivity to Vero E6 cells for up to 48 h.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a great concern on both public and veterinary health. Multiple studies showed that the SARS-CoV-2 can persist for few days in wet condition, but it has not been clear whether the virus can maintain the infectivity in dry condition. Thus, we measured the infectious titer of dried SARS-CoV-2 (104 pfu/25 Î¼L droplet) at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 24, and 48 h. Strikingly, the dried SARS-CoV-2 virus did not lose the infectivity to Vero E6 cells for up to 48 h. Our findings warrants that the drying cannot replace the surface disinfection to prevent transmission via common vehicle or nosocomial infection. Future studies can apply our experimental setting to test the efficacy of diverse disinfecting procedures."
6889,Outcomes of Nursing Home COVID-19 Patients by Initial Symptoms and Comorbidity: Results of Universal Testing of 1970 Residents.,"Objective: Clinical implications of asymptomatic cases of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in nursing homes remain poorly understood. We assessed the association of symptom status and medical comorbidities on mortality and hospitalization risk associated with COVID-19 in residents across 15 nursing homes in Maryland. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting and participants: 1970 residents from 15 nursing home facilities with universal COVID-19 testing in Maryland. Methods: We used descriptive statistics to compare baseline characteristics, logistic regression to assess the association of comorbidities with COVID-19, and Cox regression to assess the association of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 with mortality and hospitalization. We assessed the association of comorbidities with mortality and hospitalization risk. Symptom status was assessed at the time of the first test. Maximum follow-up was 94 days. Results: Among the 1970 residents (mean age 73.8, 57% female, 68% black), 752 (38.2%) were positive on their first test. Residents who were positive for COVID-19 and had multiple symptoms at the time of testing had the highest risk of mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 4.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.97, 6.65) and hospitalization (subhazard ratio 2.38, 95% CI 1.70, 3.33), even after accounting for comorbidity burden. Cases who were asymptomatic at testing had a higher risk of mortality (HR 2.92, 95% CI 1.95, 4.35) but not hospitalization (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82, 1.38) compared with those who were negative for COVID-19. Of 52 SARS-CoV-2-positive residents who were asymptomatic at the time of testing and were closely monitored for 14 days at one facility, only 6 (11.6%) developed symptoms. Conclusions and implications: Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the nursing home setting was associated with increased risk of death, suggesting a need for closer monitoring of these residents, particularly those with underlying cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities."
