8490,One-step rapid quantification of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles via low-cost nanoplasmonic sensors in generic microplate reader and point-of-care device.,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the ongoing global pandemic has led to infections of millions of people and losses of many lives. The rapid, accurate and convenient SARS-CoV-2 virus detection is crucial for controlling and stopping the pandemic. Diagnosis of patients in the early stage infection are so far limited to viral nucleic acid or antigen detection in human nasopharyngeal swab or saliva samples. Here we developed a method for rapid and direct optical measurement of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in one step nearly without any sample preparation using a spike protein specific nanoplasmonic resonance sensor. As low as 370 vp/mL were detected in one step within 15 min and the virus concentration can be quantified linearly in the range of 0 to 107 vp/mL. Measurements shown on both generic microplate reader and a handheld smartphone connected device suggest that our low-cost and rapid detection method may be adopted quickly under both regular clinical environment and resource-limited settings."
8491,The COVID-19 pandemic: a global health crisis.,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent for a series of atypical respiratory diseases in the Hubei Province of Wuhan, China in December of 2019. The disease SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome surrounded by an extracellular membrane containing a series of spike glycoproteins resembling a crown. COVID-19 infection results in diverse symptoms and morbidity depending on individual genetics, ethnicity, age, and geographic location. In severe cases, COVID-19 pathophysiology includes destruction of lung epithelial cells, thrombosis, hypercoagulation, and vascular leak leading to sepsis. These events lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis in patients. COVID-19 risk factors include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes, which are highly prevalent in the United States. This population has upregulation of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, which is exploited by COVID-19 as the route of entry and infection. Viral envelope proteins bind to and degrade ACE2 receptors, thus preventing normal ACE2 function. COVID-19 infection causes imbalances in ACE2 and induces an inflammatory immune response, known as a cytokine storm, both of which amplify comorbidities within the host. Herein, we discuss the genetics, pathogenesis, and possible therapeutics of COVID-19 infection along with secondary complications associated with disease progression, including ARDS and pulmonary fibrosis. Understanding the mechanisms of COVID-19 infection will allow the development of vaccines or other novel therapeutic approaches to prevent transmission or reduce the severity of infection."
8492,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) update on epidemiology, pathogenicity, clinical course and treatments.","During the December of 2019, a series of patients with pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus; the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona (COV-2), that is, COVID-19. Since the first cluster of cases was reported in China on 31 December 2019 until the 28 April 2020, there were internationally reported 3'000'000 cases, in over 185 countries, and 207'265 deaths. To date, it is still not unanimously clear which effects parameters of virus and host are important for the development of severe disease course. According to the most updated internationally available online cases register, COVID-19 disease has mild symptoms in around 85% of cases, there are 3%-10% of critical cases, and mortality is around 5%-7%. Since currently there is no available vaccine and no well-established specific antiviral therapy, numerous agents are being tested in clinical scenarios. The most common regimens include remdesivir, convalescent plasma. Widely used chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combinations, as well as lopinavir-ritonavir were shown to have less efficient treatment effects. More severe cases of pneumonia and dyspnoea, or uncontrollable fever are treated as inpatients, and nearly 10% in intensive care units. Oxygen supplementation is indicated to maintain peripheral blood oxygenation over 90%-96%. Advanced support systems include mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membranous support; however, those without targeted antiviral therapy represent only temporary bridge for scarce potential restitution in patient themselves. The aim of review is to present current state of the art in epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical course and treatment of COVID-19 patients."
8493,SARS-CoV-2 Isolates Show Impaired Replication in Human Immune Cells but Differential Ability to Replicate and Induce Innate Immunity in Lung Epithelial Cells.,"The primary target organ of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is the respiratory tract. Currently, there is limited information on the ability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect and regulate innate immunity in human immune cells and lung epithelial cells. Here, we compared the ability of four Finnish isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients to replicate and induce interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines in different human cells. All isolates failed to replicate in dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes, and no induction of cytokine gene expression was seen. However, most of the isolates replicated in Calu-3 cells, and they readily induced type I and type III IFN gene expression. The hCoV-19/Finland/FIN-25/2020 isolate, originating from a traveler from Milan in March 2020, showed better ability to replicate and induce IFN and inflammatory responses in Calu-3 cells than other isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Our data increase the knowledge on the pathogenesis and antiviral mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell systems. IMPORTANCE With the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, information on the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and regulation of innate immunity in human immune cells and lung epithelial cells is needed. In the present study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 failed to productively infect human immune cells, but different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 showed differential ability to replicate and regulate innate interferon responses in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. These findings will open up the way for further studies on the mechanisms of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells."
8494,Quantitative Chest CT analysis in discriminating COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients.,"Introduction: COVID-19 pneumonia is characterized by ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations on Chest CT, although these CT features cannot be considered specific, at least on a qualitative analysis. The aim is to evaluate if Quantitative Chest CT could provide reliable information in discriminating COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods: From March 31, 2020 until April 18, 2020, patients with Chest CT suggestive for interstitial pneumonia were retrospectively enrolled and divided into two groups based on positive/negative COVID-19 RT-PCR results. Patients with pulmonary resection and/or CT motion artifacts were excluded. Quantitative Chest CT analysis was performed with a dedicated software that provides total lung volume, healthy parenchyma, GGOs, consolidations and fibrotic alterations, expressed both in liters and percentage. Two radiologists in consensus revised software analysis and adjusted areas of lung impairment in case of non-adequate segmentation. Data obtained were compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients and p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Performance of statistically significant parameters was tested by ROC curve analysis. Results: Final population enrolled included 190 patients: 136 COVID-19 patients (87 male, 49 female, mean age 66 ± 16) and 54 non-COVID-19 patients (25 male, 29 female, mean age 63 ± 15). Lung quantification in liters showed significant differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients for GGOs (0.55 ± 0.26L vs 0.43 ± 0.23L, p = 0.0005) and fibrotic alterations (0.05 ± 0.03 L vs 0.04 ± 0.03 L, p < 0.0001). ROC analysis of GGOs and fibrotic alterations showed an area under the curve of 0.661 (cutoff 0.39 L, 68% sensitivity and 59% specificity, p < 0.001) and 0.698 (cutoff 0.02 L, 86% sensitivity and 44% specificity, p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: Quantification of GGOs and fibrotic alterations on Chest CT could be able to identify patients with COVID-19."

8496,"The unsynchronized changes of CT image and nucleic acid detection in COVID-19: reports the two cases from Gansu, China.","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The CT image is used to assess the disease progress, whereas the continued two times of negative results from SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection had been considered as a criterion for ending antiviral treatment. We compared the two COVID-19 cases with similar backgrounds and CT image repeated intervals under treatment. Our report highlighted the unsynchronized expression in the changes of CT image and nucleic acid detection in COVID-19, and lasting positive nucleic acid test result in patients recovered from pneumonia. It may be contributed to recognize the disease and improve prevention."
8497,"TMBIM6, a potential virus target protein identified by integrated multiomics data analysis in SARS-CoV-2-infected host cells.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we collected open access data to analyze the mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that apoptosis-related pathways were enriched in the cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the results of differential expression analysis showed that biological functions related to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and lipid metabolism were disordered. TMBIM6 was identified as a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 in host cells through weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of the time course of expression of host and viral proteins. The expression and related functions of TMBIM6 were subsequently analyzed to illuminate how viral proteins interfere with the physiological function of host cells. The potential function of viral proteins was further analyzed by GEne Network Inference with Ensemble of trees (GENIE3). This study identified TMBIM6 as a target protein associated with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which might provide a novel therapeutic approach for COVID-19 in the future."

8499,Origin of imported SARS-CoV-2 strains in The Gambia identified from whole genome sequences.,"The SARS-CoV-2 disease, first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has become a global pandemic and is causing an unprecedented burden on health care systems and the economy globally. While the travel history of index cases may suggest the origin of infection, phylogenetic analysis of isolated strains from these cases and contacts will increase the understanding and link between local transmission and other global populations. The objective of this analysis was to provide genomic data on the first six cases of SARS-CoV-2 in The Gambia and to determine the source of infection. This ultimately provide baseline data for subsequent local transmission and contribute genomic diversity information towards local and global data. Our analysis has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus identified in The Gambia are of European and Asian origin and sequenced data matched patients' travel history. In addition, we were able to show that two COVID-19 positive cases travelling in the same flight had different strains of SARS-CoV-2. Although whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is still limited in sub-Saharan Africa, this approach has proven to be a highly sensitive, specific and confirmatory tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection."
