1270,Is the Patient Infected with SARS-CoV-2?,The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently uses the nasopharyngeal swab specimen as the reference standard for evaluation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assays. We propose that the patient-infected status algorithm is a superior way to classify whether an individual is infected or not infected.
1271,Transmission event of SARS-CoV-2 delta variant reveals multiple vaccine breakthrough infections.,"Background: This study aims to identify the causative strain of SARS-CoV-2 in a cluster of vaccine breakthroughs. Vaccine breakthrough by a highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain is a risk to global public health. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected vaccine breakthrough cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) by qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) for Wuhan-Hu1 and alpha variant. Positive samples were then sequenced by Swift Normalase Amplicon Panels to determine the causal variant. GATK (genome analysis toolkit) variants were filtered with allele fraction â‰¥80 and min read depth 30x. Results: Viral sequencing revealed an infection cluster of 6 vaccinated patients infected with the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant. With no history of vaccine breakthrough, this suggests the delta variant may possess immune evasion in patients that received the Pfizer BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, and Covaxin BBV152. Conclusions: Delta variant may pose the highest risk out of any currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, with previously described increased transmissibility over alpha variant and now, possible vaccine breakthrough. Funding: Parts of this work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (1U19AI144297) and Baylor College of Medicine internal funding."
1272,The Worldwide Effort to Develop Vaccines for COVID-19.,"There have been recent encouraging reports about the development of vaccines for COVID-19. Given the scale and effects of this pandemic on public health and economies worldwide, there has been an unprecedented approach across the globe, leading to the emergence of vaccine candidates many times faster than the normal process would allow. This review gives up-to-date information as of November 28, 2020, on the latest developments in this area and covers the plans to roll out the most promising vaccines across the entire world to halt the spread of this devastating virus."
1273,CoronaPep: An Anti-Coronavirus Peptide Generation Tool.,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections have adopted the shape of a global pandemic now, demanding an urgent vaccine design. The current work reports contriving an anti-coronavirus peptide scanner tool to discern anti-coronavirus targets in the embodiment of peptides. The proffered CoronaPep tool features the fast fingerprinting of the anti-coronavirus target serving supreme prominence in the current bioinformatics research. The anti-coronavirus target protein sequences reported from the current outbreak are scanned against the anti-coronavirus target data-sets via CORONAPEP which provides precision-based anti-coronavirus peptides. This tool is specifically for the coronavirus data, which can predict peptides from the whole genome, or a gene or protein's list. Besides it is relatively fast, accurate, userfriendly and can generate maximum output from the limited information. The availability of tools like CORONAPEP will immeasurably perquisite researchers in the discipline of oncology and structure-based drug design."
1274,"COVID-19 seroprevalence in military police force, Southern Brazil.","Background: Limited data is available regarding the frequency of COVID-19 in populations that are highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2. In this cross-section study we evaluated COVID-19 seroprevalence in military police forces of 10 major cities in Rio Grande do Sul, South of Brazil. Methods: Sampling was randomly performed in clusters, in respect to the number of professionals at service per city and military unit. Research subjects were evaluated on July 23, 2020 (first wave peak in Brazil). Clinical information was obtained, and venous blood was taken for ELISA testing (IgA, and IgG antibodies). Sample size consisted of 1,592 military workers (33.6% of study population). They were mostly man (81.2%) and young (median 34 years-old). Most had been asymptomatic (75.3%) during pandemic, and 27.5% reported close contact with COVID-19 cases (after a median time of 21 days). Antibodies were detected in 3.3% of the participants, mostly IgA (2.7%), and IgG (1.7%). After 3 weeks, 66.7% of IgA and IgG results turned negative, in addition to 78.3% and 100% of borderline IgA and IgG results, respectively. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of COVID-19 amongst military police was at least 3.4 higher than the findings of other studies performed in the general population, in the same cities and dates. Most detectable antibodies were of IgA class, which implies recent exposure. Asymptomatic people were more prone to have negative antibody titters in the second run."
1275,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in nasopharynx according to clinical phenotype of affected patients.,"Objectives: Duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the upper respiratory tract is extremely variable, but its relation to disease severity is unknown. We investigated this relation in the 530 000 inhabitants of the northeastern Italian province of Udine. Methods: We analysed real-time RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens conducted at the Virology Laboratory of the University Hospital of Udine, Italy (which serves the whole province) from 1 March to 30 April 2020 Specimens were from positive individuals in four groups characterized by different disease severity (critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units, patients admitted to infectious disease units, symptomatic patients visiting the emergency department and not hospitalized, and asymptomatic individuals tested during contact tracing or screening activities). Duration of viral positivity was assessed from the first positive test to the day of the first of two consecutive negative tests. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate differences in the four groups. Results: From 1 March to 30 April, 39 483 RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were conducted on 23 778 individuals, and 974 individuals had a positive test result. Among those with multiple tests (n = 878), mean time to negativity was 23.7 days (standard error 0.3639; median 23, interquartile range 16-30 days). Mean time to negativity was longer in the group admitted to the intensive care unit than in the others, whereas no difference was observed between asymptomatic patients and those with mild disease. Conclusions: Disease control measures should not be adjusted to account for differences in viral shedding according to symptomatic status."
1276,SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma samples of COVID-19 affected individuals: a cross-sectional proof-of-concept study.,"Background: Recent studies showed that plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA seems to be associated with worse COVID-19 outcome. However, whether specific population can be at higher risk of viremia are to date unexplored. Methods: This cross-sectional proof-of-concept study included 41 SARS-CoV-2-positive adult individuals (six affected by haematological malignancies) hospitalized at two major hospital in Milan, for those demographic, clinical and laboratory data were available. SARS-CoV-2 load was quantified by ddPCR in paired plasma and respiratory samples. To assess significant differences between patients with and patients without viremia, Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon test were used for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Results: Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 8 patients (19.5%), with a median (IQR) value of 694 (209-1023) copies/mL. Viremic patients were characterized by an higher mortality rate (50.0% vs 9.1%; p = 0.018) respect to patients without viremia. Viremic patients were more frequently affected by haematological malignancies (62.5% vs. 3.0%; p < 0.001), and had higher viral load in respiratory samples (9,404,000 [586,060-10,000,000] vs 1560 [312-25,160] copies/mL; p = 0.002). Conclusions: Even if based on a small sample population, this proof-of-concept study poses the basis for an early identification of patients at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 viremia, and therefore likely to develop severe COVID-19, and supports the need of a quantitative viral load determination in blood and respiratory samples of haematologic patients with COVID-19 in order to predict prognosis and consequently to help their further management."
1277,Immunological surrogate endpoints of COVID-2019 vaccines: the evidence we have versus the evidence we need.,"In response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, over 200 vaccine candidates against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) are under development and currently moving forward at an unparalleled speed. The availability of surrogate endpoints would help to avoid large-scale filed efficacy trials and facilitate the approval of vaccine candidates, which is crucial to control COVID-19 pandemic. Several phase 3 efficacy trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates are under way, which provide opportunities for the determination of COVID-19 correlates of protection. In this paper, we review current knowledge for existence of COVID-19 correlates of protection, methods for assessment of immune correlates of protection and issues related to COVID-19 correlates of protection."

1279,Summary of the Available Molecular Methods for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 during the Ongoing Pandemic.,"Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an excess in morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Containment strategies rely firstly on rapid and sensitive laboratory diagnosis, with molecular detection of the viral genome in respiratory samples being the gold standard. The reliability of diagnostic protocols could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 genetic variability. In fact, mutations occurring during SARS-CoV-2 genomic evolution can involve the regions targeted by the diagnostic probes. Following a review of the literature and an in silico analysis of the most recently described virus variants (including the UK B 1.1.7 and the South Africa 501Y.V2 variants), we conclude that the described genetic variability should have minimal or no effect on the sensitivity of existing diagnostic protocols for SARS-CoV-2 genome detection. However, given the continuous emergence of new variants, the situation should be monitored in the future, and protocols including multiple targets should be preferred."
