8290,Peridomestic Mammal Susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection.,"Wild animals have been implicated as the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but it is largely unknown how the virus affects most wildlife species and if wildlife could ultimately serve as a reservoir for maintaining the virus outside the human population. We show that several common peridomestic species, including deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, and striped skunks, are susceptible to infection and can shed the virus in respiratory secretions. In contrast, we demonstrate that cottontail rabbits, fox squirrels, Wyoming ground squirrels, black-tailed prairie dogs, house mice, and racoons are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results expand the knowledge base of susceptible species and provide evidence that human-wildlife interactions could result in continued transmission of SARS-CoV-2."

8292,A case of severe course of COVID-19 treated with experimental therapy.,"70-year-old high-risk patient with severe course of COVID-19 hospitalized for progressive dyspnea due to extensive bilateral pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin from day one of hospital stay. Because of progression on the therapy, the convalescent plasma was administered on day three of hospitalization. The patient subsequently improved and was discharged home on day eleven of the hospital stay. Risk factors of severe course of the infection, complications and potential therapies of COVID-19 are discussed."

8294,SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater: State of the knowledge and research needs.,"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which was officially declared by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae that consists of a group of enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genome, which cause diseases ranging from common colds to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although the major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are inhalation of aerosol/droplet and person-to-person contact, currently available evidence indicates that the viral RNA is present in wastewater, suggesting the need to better understand wastewater as potential sources of epidemiological data and human health risks. Here, we review the current knowledge related to the potential of wastewater surveillance to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19, methodologies for the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and information relevant for human health risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2. There has been growing evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and the presence of viral RNA not only in feces of infected individuals but also in wastewater. One of the major challenges in SARS-CoV-2 detection/quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol. Currently available data are also limited for conducting a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for SARS-CoV-2 exposure pathways. However, modeling-based approaches have a potential role to play in reducing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, QMRA parameters obtained from previous studies on relevant respiratory viruses help to inform risk assessments of SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding on the potential role of wastewater in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is largely limited by knowledge gaps in its occurrence, persistence, and removal in wastewater. There is an urgent need for further research to establish methodologies for wastewater surveillance and understand the implications of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater."

8296,Prognostic Value of Lung Ultrasonography in Older Nursing Home Residents Affected by COVID-19.,"Objectives: Lung ultrasonographic (LUS) imaging may play an important role in the management of patients with COVID-19-associated lung injury, particularly in some special populations. However, data regarding the prognostic role of the LUS in nursing home residents, one of the populations most affected by COVID-19, are not still available. Design: Retrospective. Settings and participants: Nursing home residents affected by COVID-19 were followed up with an LUS from April 8 to May 14, 2020, in Chioggia, Venice. Methods: COVID-19 was diagnosed through a nasopharyngeal swab. LUS results were scored using a 12-zone method. For each of the 12 zones (2 posterior, 2 anterior, 2 lateral, for both left and right lungs), the possible score ranged from 0 to 3 (1 = presence of B lines, separated, with <50% of space from the pleural line; 2 = presence of B lines, separated, with >50% of space from the pleural line; 3 = lung thickening with tissuelike aspect). The total score ranged from 0 to 36. Mortality was assessed using administrative data. Data regarding accuracy (and related parameters) were reported. Results: Among 175 nursing home residents, 48 (mean age: 84.1 years; mainly female) were affected by COVID-19. Twelve died during the follow-up period. The mean LUS score was 3. The area under the curve of LUS in predicting mortality was 0.603 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.419-0.787], and it increased to 0.725 (95% CI: 0.41-0.99) after including follow-up LUS controls. Taking an LUS score ≥4 as exposure variable and mortality as outcome, the sensitivity was 58.33% and specificity 63.89%, with a positive likelihood ratio of 1.62 and a negative of 0.65. Conclusions and implications: LUS is able to significantly predict mortality in nursing home residents affected by COVID-19, suggesting that this simple tool can be routinely used in this setting instead of more invasive techniques available only in hospital."
8297,"Positive selection as a key player for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity: Insights into ORF1ab, S and E genes.","The human β-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It causes Covid-19 disease which has become pandemic. Each of the five-known human β-coronaviruses has four major structural proteins (E, M, N and S) and 16 non-structural proteins encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b together (ORF1ab) that are involved in virus pathogenicity and infectivity. Here, we performed detailed positive selection analyses for those six genes among the four previously known human β-coronaviruses and within 38 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to assess signatures of adaptive evolution using maximum likelihood approaches. Our results suggest that three genes (E, S and ORF1ab genes) are under strong signatures of positive selection among human β-coronavirus, influencing codons that are located in functional important protein domains. The E protein-coding gene showed signatures of positive selection in two sites, Asp 66 and Ser 68, located inside a putative transmembrane α-helical domain C-terminal part, which is preferentially composed by hydrophilic residues. Such Asp and Ser sites substitutions (hydrophilic residues) increase the stability of the transmembrane domain in SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, substitutions in the spike (S) protein S1 N-terminal domain have been found, all of them were located on the S protein surface, suggesting their importance in viral transmissibility and survival. Furthermore, evidence of strong positive selection was detected in three of the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins (NSP1, NSP3, NSP16), which are encoded by ORF1ab and play vital roles in suppressing host translation machinery, viral replication and transcription and inhibiting the host immune response. These results are insightful to assess the role of positive selection in the SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins, which will allow to better understand the virulent pathogenicity of the virus and potentially identifying targets for drug or vaccine strategy design."
8298,Rapid point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP).,"Background: Fast, reliable and easy to handle methods are required to facilitate urgently needed point-of-care testing (POCT) in the current coronavirus pandemic. Life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread all over the world, infecting more than 33,500,000 people and killing over 1 million of them as of October 2020. Infected individuals without any symptoms might still transfer the virus to others underlining the extraordinary transmissibility of this new coronavirus. In order to identify early infections effectively, treat patients on time and control disease spreading, rapid, accurate and onsite testing methods are urgently required. Results: Here we report the development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based method to detect SARS-CoV-2 genes ORF8 and N directly from pharyngeal swab samples. The established reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay detects SARS-CoV-2 directly from pharyngeal swab samples without previous time-consuming and laborious RNA extraction. The assay is sensitive and highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection, showing no cross reactivity when tested on 20 other respiratory pathogens. The assay is 12 times faster and 10 times cheaper than routine reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction, depending on the assay used. Conclusion: The fast and easy to handle RT-LAMP assay amplifying specifically the genomic regions ORF8 and N of SARS-CoV-2 is ideally suited for POCT at e.g. railway stations, airports or hospitals. Given the current pandemic situation, rapid, cost efficient and onsite methods like the here presented RT-LAMP assay are urgently needed to contain the viral spread."
8299,Quantitative analysis of ACE2 binding to coronavirus spike proteins: SARS-CoV-2 vs. SARS-CoV and RaTG13.,"The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Bat virus RaTG13 and SARS-CoV are also members of the coronavirus family and SARS-CoV caused a world-wide pandemic in 2003. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and RaTG13 bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through their receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with a higher binding affinity than SARS-CoV and RaTG13. Here we performed molecular dynamics simulation of these binding complexes and calculated their binding free energies using a computational alanine scanning method. Our MD simulation and hotspot residue analysis showed that the lower binding affinity of SARS-CoV to ACE2 vs. SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 can be explained by different hotspot interactions in these two systems. We also found that the lower binding affinity of RaTG13 to ACE2 is mainly due to a mutated residue (D501) which resulted in a less favorable complex formation for binding. We also calculated an important mutation of N501Y in SARS-CoV-2 using both alanine scanning calculation and a thermodynamic integration (TI) method. Both calculations confirmed a significant increase of the binding affinity of the N501Y mutant to ACE2 and explained its molecular mechanism. The present work provides an important theoretical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism in coronavirus spike protein binding to human ACE2."
