390,Hitting the diagnostic sweet spot: Point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 salivary antigen testing with an off-the-shelf glucometer.,"Significant barriers to the diagnosis of latent and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection continue to hamper population-based screening efforts required to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of widely available antiviral therapeutics or vaccines. We report an aptamer-based SARS-CoV-2 salivary antigen assay employing only low-cost reagents ($3.20/test) and an off-the-shelf glucometer. The test was engineered around a glucometer as it is quantitative, easy to use, and the most prevalent piece of diagnostic equipment globally, making the test highly scalable with an infrastructure that is already in place. Furthermore, many glucometers connect to smartphones, providing an opportunity to integrate with contact tracing apps, medical providers, and electronic health records. In clinical testing, the developed assay detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient saliva across a range of viral loads - as benchmarked by RT-qPCR - within 1 h, with 100% sensitivity (positive percent agreement) and distinguished infected specimens from off-target antigens in uninfected controls with 100% specificity (negative percent agreement). We propose that this approach provides an inexpensive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic for distributed screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection at scale."
391,Verification and Validation of SARS-CoV-2 Assay Performance on the Abbott m2000 and Alinity m Systems.,"We verified the analytical performance of the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay on the m2000 system and compared its clinical performance to the CDC 2019-nCoV real-time PCR diagnostic panel and the Thermo Fisher TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit. We also performed a bridging study comparing the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay with the new Abbott Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay. A number of standards, reference materials, and commercially available controls were used for the analytical verification to confirm the limit of detection, linearity, and reproducibility. We used nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens collected in saline for the clinical verification and bridging studies. Overall, we found 91.2% positive percent agreement (PPA; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 76.2 to 98.14%) and a 100% negative percent agreement (NPA; 95% CI = 97.97 to 100%) between the results of the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 and CDC tests with 217 NP specimens (P = 0.13). We found a PPA of 100% (95% CI = 90.26 to 100%) and an NPA of 95.15% (95% CI = 83.47 to 99.4%) between the results of the RealTime and TaqPath tests with 77 NP specimens (P = 0.24). Finally, we tested 203 NP swab specimens for SARS-CoV-2 on the m2000 on the Alinity m systems. The PPA and NPA were 92.2% (95% CI = 85.3 to 96.59%) and 92% (95% CI = 84.8 to 96.5%), respectively (P = 0.4). Although cycle number (Cn) values obtained for the concordant positive samples were highly correlated (R 2 = 0.95), the Cn values were on average 14.14 higher on the Alinity m system due to the unread cycles with the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay."
392,A novel method for conserved sequence extraction with prospective mutation prediction for SARS-CoV-2 PCR primer design.,"While the whole genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 had been revealed, it was also demonstrated that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits identity with the genome of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with ratios of 80 % and 50 % respectively. In the light of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality data, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 came into prominence around the world. As such many RT-PCR kits have been developed by biotechnology scientists. However viruses are fast mutating organisms and in order to increase accuracy, feasibility in long term and avoid the off target results of RT-PCR assays, regions of viral genome with low mutation rate and designing of primers targeting these regions are quite important. In this scope, we are presenting a novel algorithm that could be used for finding low mutation rate regions of SARS-CoV-2 and primers that were designed according to findings from our algorithm in this study."
393,Evaluation of three rapid lateral flow antigen detection tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high demand of diagnostic tools. Rapid antigen detection tests have been developed and many have received regulatory acceptance such as CE IVD or FDA markings. Their performance needs to be carefully assessed. Materials and methods: 158 positive and 40 negative retrospective samples collected in saline and analyzed by a laboratory-developed RT-PCR test were used to evaluate Sofia (Quidel), Standard Q (SD Biosensor), and Panbio™ (Abbott) rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs). A subset of the specimens was subjected to virus culture. Results: The specificity of all RADTs was 100 % and the sensitivity and percent agreement was 80 % and 85 % for Sofia, 81 % and 85 % for Standard Q, and 83 % and 86 % for Panbio™, respectively. All three RADTs evaluated in this study reached a more than 90 % sensitivity for samples with a high viral load as estimated from the low Ct (Cycle threshold) values in the reference RT-PCR. Virus culture was successful in 80 % of specimens with a Ct value <25. Conclusions: As expected, the RADTs were less sensitive than RT-PCR. However, they benefit from the speed and ease of testing, and lower price as compared to RT-PCR. Repeated testing in appropriate settings may improve the overall performance."
394,Performance evaluation of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel.,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the QIAstat-Dx® Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel (QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2), which is a closed, fully automated, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that detects severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 21 other pathogens that cause respiratory disease. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with or suspected of having coronavirus disease 2019 were collected and tested at Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris, France. Using the World Health Organisation-approved real-time-PCR assay developed by the Charité Institute of Virology as the reference, positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated. Results: In total, 189 negative and 88 positive samples were analyzed. QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 had an NPA of 90.48% (95% confidence interval (CI), 85.37%, 94.26%) and a PPA of 94.32% (95% CI, 87.24%, 98.13%). Co-infections were detected by QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 in 4/277 specimens. The methods exhibited comparable failure rates (23/307 [7.5%] vs. 6/298 [2.0%] for QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 and reference methods, respectively). The turnaround time was shorter for QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 compared with the reference method (difference in mean -14:30 h [standard error, 0:03:23; 95% CI, -14:37, -14:24]; P < 0.001). Conclusions: QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 shows good agreement with the reference assay, providing faster and accurate results for detecting SARS-CoV-2."
395,Comparative performance of CRISPR-Cas12a assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection tested with RNA extracted from clinical specimens.,"COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection continue to cause the morbidity and mortality in many countries. Limitations of the gold standard qRT-PCR for diagnosis of this infection includes need for expensive equipment, specialized molecular laboratory, and experienced staff. Currently, CRISPR-based diagnostic method was approved by the U.S. FDA for rapid detection. Several studies developed SARS-CoV-2 detection based on CRISPR-Cas12a platform; however, the validations with RNA extracted from clinical specimens were limited. Therefore, this study evaluated the clinical performance of previously described CRISPR-Cas12a based diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2. According to the results, the CRISPR-Cas12a assays on N1 and S genes provided diagnostic accuracy (≥ 95 %) comparable to the qRT-PCR results. The assays with E, N2 and S genes yielded acceptable sensitivity of detection (≥ 95 %) whereas N1 and S genes provided outstanding specificity of detection (100 %). Preferably, multiple target genes should be detected by using CRISPR-Cas12a to ensure the most effective SARS-CoV-2 detection. Therefore, the N1 and S genes would be attractive target genes for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on CRISPR-Cas12a."
396,An in-well direct lysis method for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real time RT-PCR in eSwab specimens.,"Background: Diagnostic real time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) is usually done using nucleic acid (NA) purified from the sample. In the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reagents and utensils for NA purification has been in short supply. This has generated interest in methods that eliminate the need for NA purification. Objectives: To investigate if addition of detergent to rRT-PCR master mix (MM) enabled in-well direct lysis and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical eSwab specimens. Study design: IGEPAL-CA-630 (IGEPAL) was added to SARS-CoV-2 MM to 0.3 % final concentration and crude sample was added directly to the PCR well containing MM. Cycle of positivity (Cp) and categorical agreement was compared in samples tested in standard rRT-PCR after NA purification and in in-well lysis, direct rRT-PCR. Results: In-well lysis direct rRT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 27/30 previously SARS-CoV-2+ samples with an average bias of 3.26 cycles (95 %CI: 0.08-6.43 cycles). All 30 previously test negative samples remained negative when tested in in-well lysis, direct PCR. Conclusions: Supplementation of detergent to MM was shown to be useful for the detection of SARS CoV-2 in eSwab specimens (COPAN) by direct rRT-PCR without prior NA purification."
397,Differences in Performance Characteristics Among Four High-Throughput Assays for the Detection of Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Using a Common Set of Patient Samples.,"Objectives: Serologic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has experienced a changing landscape of available assays coupled with uncertainty surrounding performance characteristics. Studies are needed to directly compare multiple commercially available assays. Methods: Residual serum samples were identified based on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, clinical test results, and collection dates. Serum samples were analyzed using assays from four different manufacturers: DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, EUROIMMUN anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, and Siemens SARS-CoV-2 Total antibody assays. Results: Samples from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients became increasingly positive as time from symptom onset increased. For patients with latest sample 14 or more days after symptom onset, sensitivities reached 93.1% to 96.6%, 98.3%, and 96.6% for EUROIMMUN, Roche, and Siemens assays, respectively, which were superior to the DiaSorin assay at 87.7%. The specificity of Roche and Siemens assays was 100% and superior to DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN assays, which ranged from 96.1% to 97.0% and 86.3% to 96.4%, respectively. Conclusions: Laboratories should be aware of the advantages and limitations of serology testing options for SARS-CoV-2. The specificity and sensitivity achieved by the Roche and Siemens assays would be acceptable for testing in lower-prevalence regions and have the potential of orthogonal testing advantages if used in combination."
398,Deepening of In Silico Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Detection RT-qPCR Assays in the Context of New Variants.,"For 1 year now, the world is undergoing a coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The most widely used method for COVID-19 diagnosis is the detection of viral RNA by RT-qPCR with a specific set of primers and probe. It is important to frequently evaluate the performance of these tests and this can be done first by an in silico approach. Previously, we reported some mismatches between the oligonucleotides of publicly available RT-qPCR assays and SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from GISAID and NCBI, potentially impacting proper detection of the virus. In the present study, 11 primers and probe sets investigated during the first study were evaluated again with 84,305 new SARS-CoV-2 unique genomes collected between June 2020 and January 2021. The lower inclusivity of the China CDC assay targeting the gene N has continued to decrease with new mismatches detected, whereas the other evaluated assays kept their inclusivity above 99%. Additionally, some mutations specific to new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were found to be located in oligonucleotide annealing sites. This might impact the strategy to be considered for future SARS-CoV-2 testing. Given the potential threat of the new variants, it is crucial to assess if they can still be correctly targeted by the primers and probes of the RT-qPCR assays. Our study highlights that considering the evolution of the virus and the emergence of new variants, an in silico (re-)evaluation should be performed on a regular basis. Ideally, this should be done for all the RT-qPCR assays employed for SARS-CoV-2 detection, including also commercial tests, although the primer and probe sequences used in these kits are rarely disclosed, which impedes independent performance evaluation."
399,Proposed Framework for Considering SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Testing of Unexposed Asymptomatic Workers in Selected Workplaces.,"Objectives: To propose a framework for considering SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing of unexposed asymptomatic workers in selected workplaces. Methods: This is a commentary based on established occupational safety and health principles, published articles, and other pertinent literature, including non-peer-reviewed preprints in medrixiv.org prior to April 16, 2021. Results: Not applicable to this commentary/viewpoint article. Conclusion: Antigen testing is a rapidly evolving and useful public health tool that can be used to guide measures to reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and in selected workplaces. This commentary provides a proposed framework for occupational safety and health practitioners and employers for considering antigen testing as a method to screen asymptomatic workers in selected non-healthcare settings. When applied selectively, antigen testing can be a useful, effective part of a comprehensive workplace program for COVID-19 prevention and control."
