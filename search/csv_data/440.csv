4392,Diagnostic value of using a combination of nucleic acid and specific antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus disease 2019.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged disease with various clinical manifestations and imaging features. The diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on a positive nucleic acid amplification test by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the clinical manifestations and imaging features of COVID-19 are non-specific, and nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 can have false-negative results. It is presently believed that detection of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is an effective screening and diagnostic indicator for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, a combination of nucleic acid and specific antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 will be more effective to diagnose COVID-19, especially to exclude suspected cases."
4393,Comparison of saliva and oro-nasopharyngeal swab sample in the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19.,"Background: Healthcare personnel are at risk of becoming infected while taking upper and/or lower respiratory tract specimens. Therefore, there is a need for sampling methods that do not risk infecting them. In this study, we aimed to compare the saliva and Oro-Nasopharyngeal Swab (ONS) sampling methods. Methods: Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 included patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Group 2 included patients with COVID-19 compatible findings in lung computed tomography (CT), but with a negative PCR. Group 3 included patients who presented to the emergency department with COVID-19 compatible complaints but had normal CT. Saliva and ONS samples were taken on the third day of hospitalization in groups 1 and 2, whereas in group 3, they were taken at the time of admission to the hospital. Results: A total of 64 patients were included in the study. The average age was 51.04 Â± 17.9 years, and 37 (57.8%) were male. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 27 (42.2%) patients' saliva samples. While the sensitivity and positive predictive value of saliva samples were 85.2%, specificity and negative predictive value were 89.2%. The value of kappa was in substantial agreement (0.744), and it was found statistically significant (<0.001). Conclusions: Saliva samples can be used instead of ONS samples in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Investigating SARS-CoV-2 with saliva is cheaper, easier for the patient and overall, and, most importantly, it poses much less risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination to healthcare personnel."
4394,Protecting our vulnerable in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons learnt from Malta.,"Objectives: COVID-19 is a health burden threatening the elderly and those with comorbidities. Malta is an ageing and cardiometabolic country. The study depicts how Malta protected the elderly and the effect of vaccination on this subpopulation. Study design: Observational study with quantitative analyses. Method: Data were obtained from Malta's COVID dashboard, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and Maltese newspapers. The case-fatality ratio (CFR) and Years of Life Lost (YLLs) for COVID were calculated. Comparisons were made between COVID-19 mortality and YLL to the pre-COVID leading mortality causes. Comparative observations were made between positive and mortality cases stratified by age groups in relation to the cumulative vaccination doses. Results: The elderly were cocooned during the first wave (CFR 0.98) through the Vulnerable Act, with only 10.80% of positive cases and seven out nine deaths above 65 years. The Vulnerable Act was not reinstated again, with 13.68% of positive cases and 91.34% (n = 369) of deaths above 65 years during the second wave (CRF 1.39). The elderly were given priority in COVID-19 vaccination rollout leading to an inverse relationship between positive cases/mortality and vaccination coverage. Conclusion: The elderly should be protected with timely restrictions to reduce morbidity, mortality and burden on healthcare systems. Vaccination is key to protecting the elderly, although mitigation measures, such as physical distancing, are still required to prevent the resurgence of infections and hospitalizations, especially in this group."
4395,Cross-Sectional Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Among Skilled Nursing Facility Employees and Residents Across Facilities in Seattle.,"Background: Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are high-risk settings for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Infection rates among employees are infrequently described. Objective: To describe SARS-CoV-2 rates among SNF employees and residents during a non-outbreak time period, we measured cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence across multiple sites in the Seattle area. Design: SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed for SNF employees and residents using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A subset of employees completed a sociodemographic and symptom questionnaire. Participants: Between March 29 and May 13, 2020, we tested 1583 employees and 1208 residents at 16 SNFs for SARS-CoV-2. Main measure: SARS-CoV-2 testing results and symptom report among employees and residents. Key results: Eleven of the 16 SNFs had one or more resident or employee test positive. Overall, 46 (2.9%) employees had positive or inconclusive testing for SARS-CoV-2, and among those who completed surveys, most were asymptomatic and involved in direct patient care. The majority of employees tested were female (934, 73%), and most employees were Asian (392, 30%), Black (360, 28%), or white (360, 28%). Among the 1208 residents tested, 110 (9.1%) had positive or inconclusive results. There was no association between the presence of positive residents and positive employees within a SNF (p = 0.62, McNemar's test). Conclusions: In the largest study of SNFs to date, SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected among both employees and residents. Employees testing positive were often asymptomatic and involved in direct patient care. Surveillance testing is needed for SNF employees and residents during the pandemic response."
4396,Intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine: results from a population-based survey in Canada.,"Background: The success of any COVID-19 vaccine program ultimately depends on high vaccine uptake. This study determined overall intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and identified factors that predict intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Canada, specifically in key priority groups identified by the American Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) for early immunization. Methods: Individuals from research cohorts from the general population of British Columbia aged 25-69 were invited complete an online survey based on validated scales and theoretical frameworks to explore intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Two multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to determine factors associated with intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Of 4948 respondents, 79.8% intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. In multivariable modeling, respondents who intended to receive the vaccine had higher vaccine attitudinal scores (p < 0.001), reported greater influence of direct social norms (p = 0.001), and indirect social norms, including their family physician (p = 0.024), and Provincial Health Officer (p = 0.011). Older individuals (> 60 years) were more likely to intend to receive the vaccine, while females (95%CI 0.57,0.93), those with less than high school education (95%CI 0.5,0.76), those who self-identified as non-white (95%CI 0.60,0.92), self-identified as Indigenous (95%CI 0.36,0.84) and essential non-health care workers (95%CI 0.59,0.86) had lower adjusted odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: To optimize vaccine coverage, public health should focus on key messages around vaccine safety and benefit, and leverage trusted practitioners for messaging. As certain key populations identified by NACI and ACIP for early immunization report a lower intention to vaccinate, there is a need for in-depth education and support for these communities to ensure optimal uptake."
4397,"In silico comparative study of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and antigenic proteins in BCG, OPV, MMR and other vaccines: evidence of a possible putative protective effect.","Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral pandemic disease that may induce severe pneumonia in humans. In this paper, we investigated the putative implication of 12 vaccines, including BCG, OPV and MMR in the protection against COVID-19. Sequences of the main antigenic proteins in the investigated vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 proteins were compared to identify similar patterns. The immunogenic effect of identified segments was, then, assessed using a combination of structural and antigenicity prediction tools. Results: A total of 14 highly similar segments were identified in the investigated vaccines. Structural and antigenicity prediction analysis showed that, among the identified patterns, three segments in Hepatitis B, Tetanus, and Measles proteins presented antigenic properties that can induce putative protective effect against COVID-19. Conclusions: Our results suggest a possible protective effect of HBV, Tetanus and Measles vaccines against COVID-19, which may explain the variation of the disease severity among regions."
4398,Dynamic Changes of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 Patients at Early Stage of Outbreak.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world with high mortality. To diagnose promptly and accurately is the vital step to effectively control its pandemic. Dynamic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies which are important for diagnosis of infection have not been fully demonstrated. In this retrospective, single-center, observational study, we enrolled the initial 131 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Jin-Yin-Tan Hospital who had at least one-time antibody tested during their hospitalization. The dynamic changes of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in 226 serum samples were detected by ELISA. The sensitivities of IgM and IgG ELISA detection were analyzed. Result showed that the sensitivity of the IgG ELISA detection (92.5%) was significantly higher than that of the IgM (70.8%) (P < 0.001). The meantimes of seroconversion for IgM and IgG were 6 days and 3 days, respectively. The IgM and IgG antibody levels peaked at around 18 days and 23 days, and then IgM fell to below the baseline level at about day 36, whereas IgG maintained at a relatively high level. In conclusion, antibodies should be detected to aid in diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. IgG could be a sensitive indicator for retrospective diagnosis and contact tracing, while IgM could be an indicator of early infection."
4399,Recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive test in patients with COVID-19: a report of two cases.,"Background: The recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results in patients with COVID-19 is becoming more important and warrants more attention. Case presentation: This study reports 2 cases, a child with mild COVID-19 and an adult female with moderate COVID-19, who were discharged after three consecutive negative nucleic acid tests and were later readmitted to the hospital for recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity. By tracking the patients' symptoms, serum antibodies, and imaging manifestations after readmission, we found that they showed a trend of gradual improvement and recovery throughout treatment. They were cured without additional treatment, with the appearance of antibodies and the recovery of immune functions. Conclusions: It is deemed extremely necessary to improve the discharge standard of care. At the same time, nucleic acid detection is recommended to increase the dynamic monitoring of serum antibodies and imaging, strengthen the management of discharged patients, and appropriately extend the home or centralized isolation time."
