7560,Feasibility of collecting and processing of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda.,"Introduction: Evidence that supports the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for treatment of COVID-19 is increasingly emerging. However, very few African countries have undertaken the collection and processing of CCP. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of collecting and processing of CCP, in preparation for a randomized clinical trial of CCP for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, persons with documented evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in Uganda were contacted and screened for blood donation via telephone calls. Those found eligible were asked to come to the blood donation centre for further screening and consent. Whole blood collection was undertaken from which plasma was processed. Plasma was tested for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) and anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody titers. SARS-CoV-2 testing was also done on nasopharyngeal swabs from the donors. Results: 192 participants were contacted of whom 179 (93.2%) were eligible to donate. Of the 179 eligible, 23 (12.8%) were not willing to donate and reasons given included: having no time 7(30.4%), fear of being retained at the COVID-19 treatment center 10 (43.5%), fear of stigma in the community 1 (4.3%), phobia for donating blood 1 (4.3%), religious issues 1 (4.4%), lack of interest 2 (8.7%) and transport challenges 1 (4.3%). The median age was 30 years and females accounted for 3.7% of the donors. A total of 30 (18.5%) donors tested positive for different TTIs. Antibody titer testing demonstrated titers of more than 1:320 for all the 72 samples tested. Age greater than 46 years and female gender were associated with higher titers though not statistically significant. Conclusion: CCP collection and processing is possible in Uganda. However, concerns about stigma and lack of time, interest or transport need to be addressed in order to maximize donations."
7561,Multicenter comparison of the Cobas 6800 system with the RealStar RT-PCR kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: RT-PCR testing is crucial in the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of reliable and comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas® (Roche) and the RealStar® assay (Altona). Methods: Assessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas® assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMérieux). Results: Overall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76 %. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99 %. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (Cobas® minus RealStar®) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct. Conclusions: In this comparison, both RealStar® and Cobas® assays provided comparable qualitative results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar® assay, probably due to a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays."
7562,COVID-19 Vaccines: Preparing for Vaccination in the Context of Clinical Oncology Care.,"Background: In the environment of an infectious pandemic, vaccines are a primary public health strategy to prevent the spread of disease. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is heightened interest in safe and effective vaccines and their use in the context of clinical oncology practice. Objectives: This article provides foundational information about vaccines in general and vaccines developed to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the United States, as well as clinical nurse strategies to apply vaccines in clinical oncology practice. Methods: The article is based on a review of public health literature and reputable websites about vaccines and their development in clinical care. Findings: This foundational information about vaccines reviews their history and development, as well as the development of COVID-19 vaccines specifically, and discusses COVID-19 vaccines as part of clinical oncology care. Supporting best practices in clinical oncology care, nurses can provide factual, evidence-based information about vaccine safety, effectiveness, and safe administration."
7563,Developing a Framework for Pandemic COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation: a Modified Delphi Consensus Study in Korea.,"Background: This study presents a framework for determining the allocation and distribution of the limited amount of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: After analyzing the pandemic strategies of the major organizations and countries and with a literature review conducted by a core panel, a modified Delphi survey was administered to 13 experts in the fields of vaccination, infectious disease, and public health in the Republic of Korea. The following topics were discussed: 1) identifying the objectives of the vaccination strategy, 2) identifying allocation criteria, and 3) establishing a step-by-step vaccination framework and prioritization strategy based on the allocation criteria. Two rounds of surveys were conducted for each topic, with a structured questionnaire provided via e-mail in the first round. After analyzing the responses, a meeting with the experts was held to obtain consensus on how to prioritize the population groups. Results: The first objective of the vaccination strategy was maintenance of the integrity of the healthcare system and critical infrastructure, followed by reduction of morbidity and mortality and reduction of community transmission. In the initial phase, older adult residents in care homes, high-risk health and social care workers, and personal support workers who work in direct contact with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients would be prioritized. Expansion of vaccine supply would allow immunization of older adults not included in phase 1, followed by healthcare workers not previously included and individuals with comorbidities. Further widespread vaccine supply would ensure availability to the extended adult age groups (50-64 years old), critical workers outside the health sector, residents who cannot socially distance, and, eventually, the remaining populations. Conclusion: This survey provides the much needed insight into the decision-making process for vaccine allocation at the national level. However, flexibility in adapting to strategies will be essential, as new information is constantly emerging."
7564,Socioeconomic disparities and COVID-19 vaccination acceptance: a nationwide ecologic study.,"Objective: To analyse the correlation between COVID-19 vaccination percentage and socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: A nationwide ecologic study based on open-sourced, anonymized, aggregated data provided by the Israel Ministry of Health. The correlations between municipal SES, vaccination percentage and active COVID-19 cases during the vaccination campaign were analysed by using weighted Pearson correlations. To assess the adequacy of first dose vaccination rollout relative to the municipality COVID-19 disease burden, a metric termed the vaccination need ratio was devised by dividing the total number of active cases (per 10 000 people) by the vaccination percentage of the population over 60 in each municipality, and its correlation with the SES was examined. Results: 23 days after initiation of the vaccination campaign, 760 916 (56.8%) individuals over the age of 60 were vaccinated in Israel with the first dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. A negative correlation was found between the COVID-19 active case burden and the vaccination percentage of the study population in each municipality (r = -0.47, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.30). The vaccination percentage significantly correlated with the municipal SES (r = 0.83, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.87). This finding persisted but was attenuated over a 5-week period. A negative correlation between the vaccination need ratio and municipal SES (r = -0.80, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.66) was found. Discussion: Lower COVID-19 vaccination percentage was associated with lower SES and high active disease burden. Vaccination efforts should focus on areas with lower SES and high disease burden to assure equality of vaccine allocation and potentially provide a more diligent disease mitigation."
7565,"Clinical and Laboratory Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, the Virus Causing COVID-19.","In December 2019, a novel beta (β) coronavirus eventually named SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, causing an outbreak of severe and even fatal pneumonia in humans. The virus has spread very rapidly to many countries across the world, resulting in the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Clinically, the diagnosis of this unprecedented illness, called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), becomes difficult because it shares many symptoms with other respiratory pathogens, including influenza and parainfluenza viruses. Therefore, laboratory diagnosis is crucial for the clinical management of patients and the implementation of disease control strategies to contain SARS-CoV-2 at clinical and population level. Here, we summarize the main clinical and imaging findings of COVID-19 patients and discuss the advances, features, advantages, and limitations of different laboratory methods used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis."

7567,SARS-CoV-2 mucosal antibody development and persistence and their relation to viral load and COVID-19 symptoms.,"Although serological studies have shown that antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 play an important role in protection against (re)infection, the dynamics of mucosal antibodies during primary infection and their potential impact on viral load and the resolution of disease symptoms remain unclear. During the first pandemic wave, we assessed the longitudinal nasal antibody response in index cases with mild COVID-19 and their household contacts. Nasal and serum antibody responses were analysed for up to nine months. Higher nasal receptor binding domain and spike protein-specific antibody levels at study inclusion were associated with lower viral load. Older age was correlated with more frequent COVID-19 related symptoms. Receptor binding domain and spike protein-specific mucosal antibodies were associated with the resolution of systemic, but not respiratory symptoms. Finally, receptor binding domain and spike protein-specific mucosal antibodies remained elevated up to nine months after symptom onset."
7568,[Recommendations for normalizing the medical practices of burn treatment during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019].,"2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is one of the beta coronaviruses and is identified as the pathogen of the severe "" coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"" in 2019. China manages COVID-19 according to the reguirement of the highest level infectious diseases in China. Currently, the prevention and control of COVID-19 in China is at a critical period. Burn Department as an emergency discipline is confronted with risk of 2019-nCoV infection. Based on the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (6th trial edition), in combination with the latest literature at home and abroad, the features of the COVID-19, the recommendations for the COVID-19 prevention and control issued by the National Health Commission of China, and the management experience of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment of other related disciplines, we put forward some recommendations for the medical practices of burn treatment during the outbreak of the COVID-19 in outpatient and emergency, inpatient treatment, and the management of operation theatres and wards, etc. We hope these recommendations could benefit the medical professionals in the field of burn treatment and relevant hospital management during the outbreak of COVID-19, improve burn treatment, and avoid or reduce the risk of infection of medical staff."
7569,Nonstructural protein 7 and 8 complexes of SARS-CoV-2.,"The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the world has led to millions of infection cases and caused a global public health crisis. Current research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious coronavirus that spreads rapidly through communities. To understand the mechanisms of viral replication, it is imperative to investigate coronavirus viral replicase, a huge protein complex comprising up to 16 viral nonstructural and associated host proteins, which is the most promising antiviral target for inhibiting viral genome replication and transcription. Recently, several components of the viral replicase complex in SARS-CoV-2 have been solved to provide a basis for the design of new antiviral therapeutics. Here, we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8 tetramer, which comprises two copies of each protein representing nsp7's full-length and the C-terminus of nsp8 owing to N-terminus proteolysis during the process of crystallization. We also identified a long helical extension and highly flexible N-terminal domain of nsp8, which is preferred for interacting with single-stranded nucleic acids."
