1930,The strength of association between pre-and post-booster BNT162b2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies levels depends on the immunoassay.,"Objectives: Reliable evidence suggests that anticipating the humoral response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines is essential for predicting their clinical effectiveness. In this work, we sought to determine the extent to which the response of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies BNT162b2 booster measured with four different commercial immunoassays could be predicted after initial homologous vaccination. Methods: This observational study enrolled 181 SARS-CoV-2 baseline seronegative healthcare workers (mean age 42±13 years; 59.7% females), who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Antibodies levels were assessed with Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S, ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG II, Snibe S-RBD IgG, and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG. The correlation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies 21 days after the first vaccine dose and 30 days after the second dose was assessed with Pearson's test. Results: A significant correlation was found between serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies levels after the first (T1) and second (T2) BNT162b2 vaccine dose with all immunoassays, though the strength of such association depended on the immunoassay. Briefly, the highest correlation was found for LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG (r=0.71), followed by ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG II (r=0.65), Snibe S-RBD IgG (r=0.52), and then Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (r=0.40). Conclusion: The value of predicting post-booster values of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies levels from pre-booster levels significantly depends on the immunoassay used."
1931,Ultra-absorptive Nanofiber Swabs for Improved Collection and Test Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 and other Biological Specimens.,"Following the COVID-19 outbreak, swabs for biological specimen collection were thrust to the forefront of healthcare materials. Swab sample collection and recovery are vital for reducing false negative diagnostic tests, early detection of pathogens, and harvesting DNA from limited biological samples. In this study, we report a new class of nanofiber swabs tipped with hierarchical 3D nanofiber objects produced by expanding electrospun membranes with a solids-of-revolution-inspired gas foaming technique. Nanofiber swabs significantly improve absorption and release of proteins, cells, bacteria, DNA, and viruses from solutions and surfaces. Implementation of nanofiber swabs in SARS-CoV-2 detection reduces the false negative rates at two viral concentrations and identifies SARS-CoV-2 at a 10× lower viral concentration compared to flocked and cotton swabs. The nanofiber swabs show great promise in improving test sensitivity, potentially leading to timely and accurate diagnosis of many diseases."

1933,Comparison of adverse drug reactions among four COVID-19 vaccines in Europe using the EudraVigilance database: Thrombosis at unusual sites.,"Background: Real-world experience with adenoviral vector vaccines against COVID-19 raised some safety concerns. Cases of cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT) associated with thrombocytopenia have been observed after the first dose of the adenoviral vector vaccines CHADOX1 NCOV-19 and AD26.COV2.S. Objectives: To assess the reporting rate of CVT as adverse drug reaction (ADR) for the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in Europe. Patients and methods: This observational study assessed the CVT reporting rate attributed to four COVID-19 vaccines authorized in Europe, namely Tozinameran (Pfizer-Biontech), CX-024414 (Moderna), CHADOX1 NCOV-19 (AstraZeneca), and AD26.COV2.S (Janssen). Data on thrombotic ADRs reported on EudraVigilance database between January 1, 2021 and July 30, 2021, were collected. ADRs referring to CVT were identified. The reporting rate of CVT was expressed as 1 million individual vaccinated-days with 95% confidence interval. Finally, an observed-to-expected (OE) analysis was performed. Results: The reporting rate of CVT per 1 million person vaccinated-days was 1.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-2.12) for Tozinameran, 5.63 (95% CI, 4.74-6.64) for CX-024414, 21.60 (95% CI, 20.16-23.11) for CHADOX1 NCOV-19, and 11.48 (95% CI, 9.57-13.67) for AD26.COV2.S. CVT occurred alongside thrombocytopenia for the four vaccines. The OE ratio was greater than one for all four vaccines, both with the lowest and the highest CVT background incidence. Conclusions: This report on EudraVigilance data strengthens anecdotal findings on CVT following COVID-19 vaccinations. Although the European Medicines Agency released an alert only for CHADOX1 NCOV-19 and AD26.COV2.S, Tozinameran and CX-024414 also are complicated by CVT, albeit to lesser extent."

1937,Assay dependence of long-term kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.,"Since the worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the question raised whether infected patients would elicit long-lasting protective immunity. Several companies developed serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In this study, we compared 4 different serology assays in convalescents up to 7 months post-infection. Both Abbott assays showed a significative decrease of IgG antibodies over time. Whereas the Elecsys Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 N assay (Roche) initially showed a significant increase, antibody titers significantly decreased at the latest timepoint. Although not significant, the Elecsys Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 S assay (Roche) showed tendency towards increasing titers overtime. Our data showed that results of SARS-CoV-2 serology should be interpreted with caution."
1938,Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in older people.,"Several vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are on the cusp of regulatory approval. Their safety and efficacy in older people is critical to their success. Even though care home residents and older people are likely to be amongst the first to be vaccinated, these patient groups are usually excluded from clinical trials. Data from several Phase II trials have given cause for optimism, with strong antibody responses and reassuring safety profiles but, with the exception of AstraZeneca's vaccine, recruited few older people. Overall, the sparse data from Phase II trials suggest a reduction in both antibody responses and mild to moderate adverse events in well older people compared to younger participants. Many of the Phase III trials have made a conscious effort to recruit older people, and interim analyses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine have led to press releases announcing high degrees of efficacy. However, older people with co-morbidities and frailty have once again been largely excluded and there are no published data on safety and efficacy in this group. Although the speed and impact of the pandemic on older people with frailty justify an approach where they are offered vaccination first, patients and their carers and supervising health care professionals alike will need to make a decision on accepting vaccination based on limited evidence. Here we review the main candidate vaccines that may become available, with a focus on the evidence of safety and efficacy in older people."
1939,OpenABM-Covid19-An agent-based model for non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 including contact tracing.,"SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the world, causing high mortality and unprecedented restrictions on social and economic activity. Policymakers are assessing how best to navigate through the ongoing epidemic, with computational models being used to predict the spread of infection and assess the impact of public health measures. Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks. By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries. OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing, and vaccination programmes. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day, allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 are its Python and R interfaces, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic."
