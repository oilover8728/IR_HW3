9060,Potential protective role of the anti-PD-1 blockade against SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The outbreak of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and its global dissemination became the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. In patients undergoing immunotherapy, the effect and path of viral infection remain uncertain. In addition, viral-infected mice and humans show T-cell exhaustion, which is identified after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Notably, they regain their T-cell competence and effectively prevent viral infection when treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Four clinical trials are officially open to evaluate anti-PD-1 antibody administration's effectiveness for cancer and non-cancer individuals influenced by COVID-19 based on these findings. The findings may demonstrate the hypothesis that a winning strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection could be the restoration of exhausted T-cells. In this review, we outline the potential protective function of the anti-PD-1 blockade against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the aim to develop SARS-CoV-2 therapy."
9061,"Attitudes about COVID-19 Lockdown among General Population, France, March 2020.","Because the effectiveness of a coronavirus disease lockdown in curbing coronavirus disease spread depends on public support, acquiring real-time information about the way populations reacted to the lockdown is crucial. In France, such public support remained fragile among low-income persons, probably because the lockdown exacerbated preexisting social inequalities and conflicts."
9062,RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19.,"According to five new studies, therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) is not associated with an increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or with an increased risk of severe disease or in-hospital death among patients with COVID-19."
9063,The first few days of a SARS-CoV-2 infection viewed at single-cell resolution.,"What transpires soon after inhaling Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the respiratory virus causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Where does infection begin? What are the features of subsequent virus spread? How might host responses quickly contain infection? Two recently published manuscripts have evaluated infection in primary cultures of well-differentiated cells to address these questions and bring more light on the proviral and antiviral components operating during the initial days after SARS-CoV-2 exposure."
9064,Sars-Cov-2 infection related inflammatory and demyelinating disease; a brief case series.,"Background: Since March 2020, during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it has been observed that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has neurological involvement with various clinical tables. Methods: We present 3 new cases admitted to our clinic with various neurological findings which were affected by SARS-CoV-2. Results: Imaging studies have shown that inflammatory/demyelinizing lesions appeared in different areas of the central nervous system which were accepted as an atypical demyelinating spectrum associated with Covid 19. Conclusions: With increasing experience, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may also have a neurotrophic effect. The spectrum of neurological involvement is also expanding as the pandemic continues. These 3 cases suggest that the virus plays a role in the clinical onset of the inflammatory/demyelinating disease."
9065,[Therapeutic Effect of Convalescent Plasma Transfusion on Fulminant Viral Infectious Diseases--Review].,"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has started to erupt in Wuhan since December 2019, and then the cases of COVID-19 increased rapidly, the epidemic situation spreaded to most area of China. Owing to the lack of specific drugs at present, convalescent plasma therapy becomes an alternative treatment. However, the choice of the donor, suitable patients, timing of treatment, administrate dose, the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment are not clear. This article reviews the clinical studies and case reports of convalescent plasma therapy in several previous viral infectious diseases in order to provide clues for the treatment of COVID-19."
9066,Digital Droplet PCR for SARS-CoV-2 Resolves Borderline Cases.,"Objectives: The Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was the first droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assay to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization approval, but it has not been evaluated clinically. We describe the performance of ddPCR-in particular, its ability to confirm weak-positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results. Methods: We clinically validated the Bio-Rad Triplex Probe ddPCR Assay. The limit of detection was determined by using serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in an artificial viral envelope. The ddPCR assay was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications on specimens confirmed to be positive (n = 48) or negative (n = 30) by an FDA-validated reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay on the m2000 RealTime system (Abbott). Ten borderline positive cases were also evaluated. Results: The limit of detection was 50 copies/mL (19 of 20 positive). Forty-seven specimens spanning a range of quantification cycles (2.9-25.9 cycle numbers) were positive by this assay (47 of 48; 97.9% positive precent agreement), and 30 negative samples were confirmed as negative (30 of 30; 100% negative percent agreement). Nine of 10 borderline cases were positive when tested in triplicate. Conclusions: The ddPCR of SARS-CoV-2 is an accurate method, with superior sensitivity for viral RNA detection. It could provide definitive evaluation of borderline positive cases or suspected false-negative cases."
9067,Association between seasonal flu vaccination and COVID-19 among healthcare workers.,"Background: In next fall and winter, SARS-CoV-2 could circulate in parallel with seasonal influenza. The dual epidemics will result in considerable morbidity and mortality; therefore, influenza vaccination may be essential. Recent studies found increased risk of coronavirus in individuals receiving influenza vaccination. Aims: Our aim is to analyse the association between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 in a population of healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods: IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 3520 HCWs at a large hospital in Northern Italy. For each participant, we collected data on flu immunization status for the last five flu seasons. Logistic regression was used to test associations between seasonal flu vaccination status and a positive serology tests for COVID-19. Results: During the last five flu seasons, 2492 vaccinations were administered. Serology tests were negative for 3196 (91%) HCWs and residents and only 21 (1%) people had an equivocal test (12.0-15.0 AU/mL). Only 128 (4%) people received a diagnosis of COVID-19, with a positive swab test. No flu vaccinations for the last five flu seasons were specifically associated with diagnosis of COVID-19 or with positive results of serology tests. Conclusions: Flu vaccinations did not appear to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Influenza vaccination should continue to be recommended for HCWs and for individuals at increased risk for severe illness from respiratory infection."
9068,Microbial co-infections in COVID-19: Associated microbiota and underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis.,"The novel coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has traumatized the whole world with the ongoing devastating pandemic. A plethora of microbial domains including viruses (other than SARS-CoV-2), bacteria, archaea and fungi have evolved together, and interact in complex molecular pathogenesis along with SARS-CoV-2. However, the involvement of other microbial co-pathogens and underlying molecular mechanisms leading to extortionate ailment in critically ill COVID-19 patients has yet not been extensively reviewed. Although, the incidence of co-infections could be up to 94.2% in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the fate of co-infections among SARS-CoV-2 infected hosts often depends on the balance between the host's protective immunity and immunopathology. Predominantly identified co-pathogens of SARS-CoV-2 are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Legionella pneumophila and Clamydia pneumoniae followed by viruses including influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. The cross-talk between co-pathogens (especially lung microbiomes), SARS-CoV-2 and host is an important factor that ultimately increases the difficulty of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19. Simultaneously, co-infecting microbiotas may use new strategies to escape host defense mechanisms by altering both innate and adaptive immune responses to further aggravate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Better understanding of co-infections in COVID-19 is critical for the effective patient management, treatment and containment of SARS-CoV-2. This review therefore necessitates the comprehensive investigation of commonly reported microbial co-pathogens amid COVID-19, their transmission pattern along with the possible mechanism of co-infections and outcomes. Thus, identifying the possible co-pathogens and their underlying molecular mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may shed light in developing diagnostics, appropriate curative and preventive interventions for suspected SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in the current pandemic."
9069,Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 with IgG from COVID-19-convalescent plasma.,"While there are various attempts to administer COVID-19-convalescent plasmas to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, neither appropriate approach nor clinical utility has been established. We examined the presence and temporal changes of the neutralizing activity of IgG fractions from 43 COVID-19-convalescent plasmas using cell-based assays with multiple endpoints. IgG fractions from 27 cases (62.8%) had significant neutralizing activity and moderately to potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell-based assays; however, no detectable neutralizing activity was found in 16 cases (37.2%). Approximately half of the patients (~ 41%), who had significant neutralizing activity, lost the neutralization activity within ~ 1 month. Despite the rapid decline of neutralizing activity in plasmas, good amounts of SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibodies were persistently seen. The longer exposure of COVID-19 patients to greater amounts of SARS-CoV-2 elicits potent immune response to SARS-CoV-2, producing greater neutralization activity and SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibody amounts. The dilution of highly-neutralizing plasmas with poorly-neutralizing plasmas relatively readily reduced neutralizing activity. The presence of good amounts of SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibodies does not serve as a surrogate ensuring the presence of good neutralizing activity. In selecting good COVID-19-convalescent plasmas, quantification of neutralizing activity in each plasma sample before collection and use is required."
