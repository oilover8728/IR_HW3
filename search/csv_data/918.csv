9170,Resolution of Persistent COVID-19 After Convalescent Plasma in a Patient with B Cell Aplasia.,
9171,[The first wave of COVID-19 in Intensive care].,"In December 2019, in Wuhan, a new human infectious pathology was born, COVID-19, consisting above all in pneumoniae, induced by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 because of the respiratory distress it caused (SARS for severe acute respiratory syndrome, and CoV for Coronavirus). A real health and planetary crisis has appeared, much more substantial than that linked to SARS-CoV-1 in 2002-2004 and to MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) in 2012. In addition to respiratory damage that can be dramatic, this pathology is complicated by the frequency of cardiovascular, renal and coagulation diseases. Health care systems have had to adapt urgently, in the absence of hindsight from the pathology, and without effective therapeutic weapons. Through this review of the literature, we detail our local practices for the overall management of patients hospitalized in Intensive care."
9172,ACE-2-Derived Biomimetic Peptides for the Inhibition of Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2.,"SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus causing overwhelming death and infection worldwide, has emerged as a pandemic. Compared to its predecessor SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more infective for being highly contagious and exhibiting tighter binding with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2). The entry of the virus into host cells is mediated by the interaction of its spike protein with hACE-2. Thus, a peptide that has a resemblance to hACE-2 but can overpower the spike protein-hACE-2 interaction will be a potential therapeutic to contain this virus. The non-interacting residues in the receptor-binding domain of hACE-2 have been mutated to generate a library of 136 new peptides. Out of this library, docking and virtual screening discover seven peptides that can exert a stronger interaction with the spike protein than hACE-2. A peptide derived from simultaneous mutation of all the non-interacting residues of hACE-2 yields almost three-fold stronger interaction than hACE-2 and thus turns out here to be the best peptide inhibitor of the novel coronavirus. The binding of the best peptide inhibitor with the spike protein is explored further by molecular dynamics, free energy, and principal component analysis, which demonstrate its efficacy compared to hACE-2. The delivery of the screened inhibitors with nanocarriers like metal-organic frameworks will be worthy of further consideration to boost their efficacy."

9174,Liquid-based cytological and immunohistochemical study of nasopharyngeal swab from persons under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Introduction: We describe cytologic and immunohistologic findings in virus transport medium on cases under investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Cytologic findings in cases under investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection from one hundred consecutive nasopharyngeal swab were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry and SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR determination were performed to detect virus. Results: No viral inclusions were noted in squamous cells obtained from virus transport medium. Immunohistochemical study with monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein showed positivity in squamous cells. No positivity was present in others cellular components. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 predominantly localizes squamous cells in cytology samples of patients with RT-PCR positive determination of SARSCoV-2. The results of the current study support the notion that the nasopharyngeal region is the anatomical station that SARS-CoV-2 infects first, and the infection can lead to the migration of the virus into the lower airways."
9175,COVID-19 Preliminary Case Series: Characteristics of EMS Encounters with Linked Hospital Diagnoses.,"Background: Few studies have examined the prehospital presentation, assessment, or treatment of patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this preliminary report is to describe prehospital encounters for patients with a COVID-19 hospital diagnosis and/or COVID-19 EMS suspicion versus those with neither a hospital diagnosis nor EMS suspicion of the disease. Methods: This case series evaluated electronic patient care records from EMS agencies participating in a large national bi-directional data exchange. All records for 9-1-1 responses between March 1 and April 19, 2020, resulting in transport to a hospital, with at least one ICD-10 outcome returned via the data exchange were included. Hospital ICD-10 codes used to determine COVID-19 diagnoses included B97.2, B97.21, B97.29, B34.2, and U07.1. COVID-19 EMS suspicion was defined as a documented EMS primary or secondary impression of COVID-19, or indication of COVID-19 suspicion in the prehospital free-text narrative. Comparisons were stratified by COVID-19 hospital diagnosis and COVID-19 EMS suspicion. Descriptive and comparative statistics are presented. Results: There were 84,540 EMS patient records with linked hospital ICD-10 codes included. Of those, 814 (1%) patients had a COVID-19 hospital diagnosis. Overall, COVID-19 EMS suspicion was documented for 3,204 (4%) patients. A COVID-19 EMS suspicion was documented for 636 (78%) of hospital diagnosed COVID-19 patients. Those with COVID-19 hospital diagnoses were more likely to present with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and fever during the EMS encounter. EMS responses for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were also more likely to originate from a skilled nursing/assisted living facility. EMS PPE (eye protection, mask, or gown) use was more frequently documented on records of patients who had hospital diagnosed COVID-19. Conclusion: In this large sample of prehospital encounters, EMS COVID-19 suspicion demonstrated sensitivity of 78% and positive predictive value of 20% compared with hospital ICD-10 codes. These data indicate that EMS suspicion alone is insufficient to determine appropriate utilization of PPE."
9176,Potential of application of the RNA interference phenomenon in the treatment of new coronavirus infection COVID-19.,"COVID-19 has killed more than 4 million people to date and is the most significant global health problem. The first recorded case of COVID-19 had been noted in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and already on March 11, 2020, World Health Organization declared a pandemic due to the rapid spread of this infection. In addition to the damage to the respiratory system, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing severe complications that can affect almost all organ systems. Due to the insufficient effectiveness of the COVID-19 therapy, there is an urgent need to develop effective specific medicines. Among the known approaches to the creation of antiviral drugs, a very promising direction is the development of drugs whose action is mediated by the mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi). A small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule suppresses the expression of a target gene in this regulatory pathway. The phenomenon of RNAi makes it possible to quickly create a whole series of highly effective antiviral drugs, if the matrix RNA (mRNA) sequence of the target viral protein is known. This review examines the possibility of clinical application of siRNAs aimed at suppressing reproduction of the SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the experience of similar studies using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection models. It is important to remember that the effectiveness of siRNA molecules targeting viral genes may decrease due to the formation of viral resistance. In this regard, the design of siRNAs targeting the cellular factors necessary for the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 deserves special attention."
9177,Effectiveness of the measures aimed at containing Sars-cov-2 virus spreading in work settings: a survey in companies based in the Veneto region of Italy.,"«Effectiveness of the measures aimed at containing Sars-cov-2 virus spreading in work settings: a survey in companies based in the Veneto region of Italy». Introduction:: During the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic, occupational health physicians worked to respond to different needs of workers, employers, and health authorities. In collaboration with the Prevention Department of the Veneto region of Italy, a survey was promoted in nine manufacturing companies in the province of Padua, to investigate the prevalence of asymptomatic SarsCov-2 virus and the immunological status of 1,267 workers. Scope:: The study was aimed at verifying the effectiveness of measures to contain the virus spread among workers in the workplace as required by the agreement between the social partners signed on March 14, 2020. Methods:: The survey was carried out at workplaces by trained health physicians and almost all company workers enrolled on a voluntary basis. Each worker was tested for viral RNA using nasopharyngeal swab and for IgM and IgG antibodies by drawing venous or capillary blood, according to the availability of tests at that difficult period. Results:: Swab-positive workers were 0.3%, and subjects with positive serological tests were 1.6% of the total workers examined. Discussion:: The diagnostic test is based on the search for viral RNA through nasopharyngeal swab. To evaluate the immunological status of workers the CLIA or Elisa quantitative serological test should be preferred. Measures to contain the virus spreading at the workplace seem to be effective, as working settings do not entail any additional risk of SarsCov-2 infection."
9178,Implementation and Outcomes of a Mobile Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Program in the United States During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in the United States around March 2020. Because of limited access to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the authors' region, a mobile ECMO team was implemented by April 2020 to serve patients with COVID-19. Several logistical and operational needs were assessed and addressed to ensure a successful program, including credentialing, equipment management, and transportation. A multidisciplinary team was included in the planning, decision-making, and implementation of the mobile ECMO. From April 2020 to January 2021, mobile ECMO was provided to 22 patients in 13 facilities across four southern California counties. The survival to hospital discharge of patients with COVID-19 who received mobile ECMO was 52.4% (11 of 21) compared with 45.2% (14 of 31) for similar patients cannulated in-house. No significant patient or transportation complications occurred during mobile ECMO. Neither the ECMO nor transport teams experianced unprotected exposures to or infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Herein, the implementation of the mobile ECMO team is reviewed, and patient characteristics and outcomes are described."
