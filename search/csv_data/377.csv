3760,Ongoing Clinical Trials for the Management of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"COVID-19 has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic with a significant health and economic burden. There are currently no approved treatments or preventative therapeutic strategies. Hundreds of clinical studies have been registered with the intention of discovering effective treatments. Here, we review currently registered interventional clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 to provide an overall summary and insight into the global response."
3761,Current advances in the detection of COVID-19 and evaluation of the humoral response.,"The new outbreak caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 started at the end of 2019 and was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, several diagnostic approaches have been re-adapted, and also improved from the previous detections of SARS and MERS coronavirus. The best strategy to handle this situation seems to rely on a triad of detection methods: (i) highly sensitive and specific techniques as the gold standard method, (ii) easier and faster point of care tests accessible for large population screening, and (iii) serology assays to complement the direct detection and to use for surveillance. In this study, we assessed the techniques and tests described in the literature, their advantages and disadvantages, and the interpretation of the results. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is undoubtedly the gold standard technique utilized not only for diagnostics, but also as a standard for comparison and validation of newer approaches. Other nucleic acid amplification methods have been shown to be adequate as point of care (POC) diagnostic tests with similar performance as RT-qPCR. The analysis of seroconversion with immunotests shows the complexity of the immune response to COVID-19. The detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can also help to detect previously infected asymptomatic individuals with negative RT-qPCR tests. Nevertheless, more controlled serology cohort studies should be performed as soon as possible to understand the immune response to SARS-CoV-2."

3763,Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among health care workers in a country with low burden of COVID-19.,"Introduction: Greece is a country with limited spread of SARS-CoV-2 and cumulative infection attack rate of 0.12% (95% CI 0.06-0.26). Health care workers (HCWs) are a well-recognized risk group for COVID-19. The study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a nosocomial setting and assess potential risk factors. Methods: HCWs from two hospitals participated in the study. Hospital-1 was a tertiary university affiliated center, involved in the care of COVID-19 patients while hospital-2 was a tertiary specialized cardiac surgery center not involved in the care of these patients. A validated, CE, rapid, IgM/IgG antibody point-of-care test was used. Comparative performance with a reference globally available assay was assessed. Results: 1,495 individuals consented to participate (response rate 77%). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 weighted prevalence was 1.26% (95% CI 0.43, 3.26) overall and 0.53% (95% CI 0.06, 2.78) and 2.70% (95% CI 0.57, 9.19) in hospital-1 and hospital-2, respectively although the study was underpowered to detect statistically significant differences. The overall, hospital-1, and hospital-2 seroprevalence was 10, 4 and 22 times higher than the estimated infection attack rate in general population, respectively. Suboptimal use of personal protective equipment was noted in both hospitals. Conclusions: These data have implications for the preparedness of a second wave of COVID-19 epidemic, given the low burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, in concordance with national projections."
3764,An original multiplex method to assess five different SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.,"Objectives: Accurate SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are urgently needed to help diagnose infection, determine past exposure of populations and assess the response to future vaccines. The study aims at assessing the performance of the multiplex D-tek COVIDOT 5 IgG assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (N, S1+S2, S1, S2 and RBD). Methods: Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 218 samples obtained from 46 rRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n=118) collected before the COVID-19 pandemic with a potential cross-reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay were included in the specificity analysis. Results: A gradual dynamic trend since symptom onset was observed for all IgG antibodies. Sensitivities before day 14 were suboptimal. At ≥21 days, sensitivities reached 100% (93.4-100%) for N, S1+S2, S2 and RBD-directed IgG and 96.3% (87.3-99.6%) for S1-directed IgG. In 42 out of 46 patients (91.3%), all five antibodies were detected at ≥14 days. The four remaining patients had between 2 and 4 positive antibodies at their respective maximal follow-up period. The specificity was 100 % for S1+S2, S2 and RBD, 98.3% for N and 92.4% (86.0-96.5%) for S1-directed IgG. The combined use of antigens increases the early sensitivity whilst enforcing high specificity. Conclusions: Sensitivities at ≥21 days and specificities were excellent, especially for N, S1+S2, S2 and RBD-directed IgG. Caution is however required when interpreting single S1-directed reactivities. Using a multiplex assay complies with the orthogonal testing algorithm of the CDC and allows a better and critical interpretation of the serological status of a patient."

From January to July 2020, 121 AGE stool samples were screened by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. We detected SARS-CoV-2 in 27.5% of samples received during the epidemic period. No infectious viruses were observed in Vero E6 cells."
3766,"Temporal relationship between serial RT-PCR results and serial chest CT imaging, and serial CT changes in coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia: a descriptive study of 155 cases in China.","Objective: To determine CT's role in the early detection of COVID-19 infection and serial CT changes in the disease course in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: From January 21 to February 18, 2020, all of the patients who were suspected of novel coronavirus infection and verified by RT-PCR tests were retrospectively enrolled in our study. All of the patients underwent serial RT-PCR tests and serial CT imaging. The temporal relationship between the serial RT-PCR results (negative conversion to positive, positive to negative) and serial CT imaging was investigated, and serial CT changes were evaluated. Results: A total of 155 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Chest CT detection time of COVID-19 pneumonia was 2.61 days earlier than RT-PCR test (p = 0.000). The lung CT improvement time was significantly shorter than that of RT-PCR conversion to negative (p = 0.000). Three stages were identified from the onset of the initial symptoms: stage 1 (0-3 days), stage 2 (4-7 days), and stage 3 (8-14 days and later). Ground glass opacity (GGO) was predominant in stage 1, then consolidation and crazy paving signs were dramatically increased in stage 2. In stage 3, fibrotic lesions were rapidly increased. There were significant differences in the main CT features (p = 0.000), number of lobes involved (p = 0.001), and lesion distribution (p = 0.000) among the different stages. Conclusion: Chest CT detected COVID-19 pneumonia earlier than the RT-PCR results and can be used to monitor disease course. Combining imaging features with epidemiology history and clinical information could facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Key points: • The chest CT detection time of COVID-19 pneumonia was 2.61 days earlier than that of an initial RT-PCR positive result (t = - 7.31, p = 0.000). • The lung CT improvement time was significantly shorter than that of RT-PCR conversion to negative (t = - 4.72, p = 0.000). • At the early stage (0-3 days), the CT features of COVID-19 were predominantly GGO and small-vessel thickening; at stage 2 (4-7 days), GGO evolved to consolidation and crazy paving signs. At stage 3 (8-14 days and later), fibrotic lesions significantly increased, accompanied by consolidation, GGO, and crazy paving signs."
3767,Testing vaccines in the time of Covid: The changing landscape.,"The initial trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were randomised control trials (RCT) with a placebo as control. The use of a placebo was ethically justified because, as with any new and emerging infectious disease, there was no known vaccine. There are now at least eight vaccines that have been shown to be effective and approved for emergency use, so the use of a placebo in the control group is no longer ethically justified. This article discusses why ethical guidelines should be continually evaluated in a changing landscape and why trust is so important."
3768,"Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance, Intention, and Hesitancy: A Scoping Review.","COVID-19 vaccine is regarded as the most promising means of limiting the spread of or eliminating the pandemic. The success of this strategy will rely on the rate of vaccine acceptance globally. The study aims to examine the factors that influence COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, intention, and hesitancy. PubMed was searched comprehensively for articles using the keyword ""COVID-19 vaccine surveys."" Of the 192 records, 22 studies were eligible for the review. Eighty-two percent of these studies were conducted among the general population. Gender, age, education, and occupation were some of the socio-demographic variables associated with vaccine acceptance. Variables such as trust in authorities, risk perception of COVID-19 infection, vaccine efficacy, current or previous influenza vaccination, and vaccine safety affected vaccine acceptance. Globally, in March 2020, the average vaccine acceptance observed was 86% which dropped to 54% in July 2020 which later increased to 72% in September 2020. Globally, the average rate of vaccine hesitancy in April 2020 was 21%, which increased to 36% in July 2020 and later declined to 16% in October 2020. Large variability in vaccine acceptance and high vaccine hesitancy can influence the efforts to eliminate the COVID-19. Addressing the barriers and facilitators of vaccines will be crucial in implementing effective and tailored interventions to attain maximum vaccine coverage."
3769,"Leveraging Transfer Learning to Analyze Opinions, Attitudes, and Behavioral Intentions Toward COVID-19 Vaccines: Social Media Content and Temporal Analysis.","Background: The COVID-19 vaccine is considered to be the most promising approach to alleviate the pandemic. However, in recent surveys, acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low. To design more effective outreach interventions, there is an urgent need to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines. Objective: Our objective was to analyze the potential of leveraging transfer learning to detect tweets containing opinions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines, and to explore temporal trends as well as automatically extract topics across a large number of tweets. Methods: We developed machine learning and transfer learning models to classify tweets, followed by temporal analysis and topic modeling on a dataset of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets posted from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We used the F1 values as the primary outcome to compare the performance of machine learning and transfer learning models. The statistical values and P values from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test were used to assess whether users' perceptions changed over time. The main topics in tweets were extracted by latent Dirichlet allocation analysis. Results: We collected 2,678,372 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from 841,978 unique users and annotated 5000 tweets. The F1 values of transfer learning models were 0.792 (95% CI 0.789-0.795), 0.578 (95% CI 0.572-0.584), and 0.614 (95% CI 0.606-0.622) for these three tasks, which significantly outperformed the machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine). The prevalence of tweets containing attitudes and behavioral intentions varied significantly over time. Specifically, tweets containing positive behavioral intentions increased significantly in December 2020. In addition, we selected tweets in the following categories: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, positive behavioral intentions, and negative behavioral intentions. We then identified 10 main topics and relevant terms for each category. Conclusions: Overall, we provided a method to automatically analyze the public understanding of COVID-19 vaccines from real-time data in social media, which can be used to tailor educational programs and other interventions to effectively promote the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines."
