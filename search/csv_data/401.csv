4000,"Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in elderly long-term care facility residents, Spain, weeks 53 2020 to 13 2021.","Residents in long-term care facilities (LTCF) experienced a large morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain and were prioritised for early COVID-19 vaccination. We used the screening method and population-based data sources to obtain estimates of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness for elderly LTCF residents. The estimates were 71% (95% CI: 56-82%), 88% (95% CI: 75-95%), and 97% (95% CI: 92-99%), against SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic), and COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths, respectively."
4001,COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among the Public in Kuwait: A Cross-Sectional Survey.,"Vaccine hesitancy (uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations) is a major barrier to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in the long term. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the public in Kuwait, to understand their attitudes towards vaccines in general, and to identify predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 4147 adults aged ≥ 18 years. The snowball sampling strategy was used for data collection through social media and e-mails. A total of 3061 (73.8%) respondents indicated that they were vaccinated or intending to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 infection, while 1086 (26.2%) expressed their vaccine hesitancy. The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were the concerns about the vaccine's possible side effects, its rushed development, and its efficacy in preventing the infection. Over half (57.2%) of respondents expressed intermediate to high levels of negative attitude towards vaccines in general. On the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the findings revealed that vaccine hesitancy was significantly more prevalent among respondents aged 30-64 years; females; married or divorced; residents of Hawalli, Al-Farwaniyah, Al-Jahra, and Mubarak Al-Kabeer; had intermediate monthly average income; non-smokers; not feeling worried about catching the infection; do not know whether any of their family members have been infected or died because of COVID-19 infection; do not have a large extent of confidence in the Kuwait health system's ability to handle the pandemic; did not receive influenza vaccine during the last year; refused or elected to forego a doctor-recommended vaccine; did not receive adequate information from the public health authorities/healthcare providers about the COVID-19 vaccines; none of their first-degree family members received or were intending to receive the vaccine; and expressed intermediate to high levels of negative attitudes towards vaccines in general. The present findings provide a steer as to the groups that most need to be reached to increase the rates of vaccine uptake."
4002,Primary Source of Information About COVID-19 as a Determinant of Perception of COVID-19 Severity and Vaccine Uptake : Source of Information and COVID-19.,"Background: Identifying the key determinants of vaccine uptake in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical to increasing vaccination rates, especially for Medicare beneficiaries. Objective: We examined how the source of COVID-19 information shapes perceptions of COVID-19 severity and the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Medicare beneficiaries. Design, setting, and participants: We included 6478 Medicare beneficiaries from the Fall 2020 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement. Main measures: Our dependent variables were perception of COVID-19 severity and the likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Our key independent variable was the beneficiaries' primary source of information about COVID-19 and included six mutually exclusive categories: traditional news sources, guidance from government officials, social media, other webpages/Internet, friends or family members, or health care providers. Key results: Compared to those relying on traditional news sources or guidance from governmental officials, those relying on other sources had lower perceptions of COVID-19 severity and lower likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Those relying on social media had the lowest levels in all measures (65.5% for those who agreed that COVID-19 is more contagious than the flu, 62.1% for those who agreed that COVID-19 is more deadly than the flu, 87.8% for those who agreed that all should take COVID-19 precautions, and 43.3% for those who answered that they would get a COVID-19 vaccine). The likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine uptake was also low among those relying on health care providers (55.5%). These findings remained similar even after adjusting for perceptions of COVID-19 severity in the relationship between the source of COVID-19 information and the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Conclusions: The primary source of information that Medicare beneficiaries used to learn about COVID-19 may play a critical role in shaping perceptions of COVID-19 severity and attitudes toward getting a COVID-19 vaccine."
4003,Spotlight on COVID-19: from biology to therapy and prevention.,"In this COVID-19 Focus Issue, we highlight a collection of recently published The FEBS Journal articles that consider the broader aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from the debunking of urban myths to highlighting some of the most pressing questions concerning SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment, prevention and pathology. The collection comprises two review articles, six Viewpoints, two research papers and one commentary. We hope that these articles will provide readers with an informative and interesting overview that will promote further critical analysis of currently available data and observations on COVID-19."

4005,Neurological complications of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients: The registry of a neurology department in the first wave of the pandemic.,"Objective: To describe the spectrum of neurological complications observed in a hospital-based cohort of COVID-19 patients who required a neurological assessment. Methods: We conducted an observational, monocentric, prospective study of patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis hospitalized during the 3-month period of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary hospital in Madrid (Spain). We describe the neurological diagnoses that arose after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. These diagnoses could be divided into different groups. Results: Only 71 (2.6%) of 2750 hospitalized patients suffered at least one neurological complication (77 different neurological diagnoses in total) during the timeframe of the study. The most common diagnoses were neuromuscular disorders (33.7%), cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) (27.3%), acute encephalopathy (19.4%), seizures (7.8%), and miscellanea (11.6%) comprising hiccups, myoclonic tremor, Horner syndrome and transverse myelitis. CVDs and encephalopathy were common in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to neuromuscular disorders, which usually appeared later on (p = 0.005). Cerebrospinal fluid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction was negative in 15/15 samples. The mortality was higher in the CVD group (38.1% vs. 8.9%; p = 0.05). Conclusions: The prevalence of neurological complications is low in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Different mechanisms appear to be involved in these complications, and there was no evidence of direct invasion of the nervous system in our cohort. Some of the neurological complications can be classified into early and late neurological complications of COVID-19, as they occurred at different times following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms."
4006,"SARS-CoV-2 Proteome Harbors Peptides Which Are Able to Trigger Autoimmunity Responses: Implications for Infection, Vaccination, and Population Coverage.","Autoimmune diseases (ADs) could occur due to infectious diseases and vaccination programs. Since millions of people are expected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccinated against it, autoimmune consequences seem inevitable. Therefore, we have investigated the whole proteome of the SARS-CoV-2 for its ability to trigger ADs. In this regard, the entire proteome of the SARS-CoV-2 was chopped into more than 48000 peptides. The produced peptides were searched against the entire human proteome to find shared peptides with similar experimentally confirmed T-cell and B-cell epitopes. The obtained peptides were checked for their ability to bind to HLA molecules. The possible population coverage was calculated for the most potent peptides. The obtained results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes share 23 peptides originated from ORF1ab polyprotein, nonstructural protein NS7a, Surface glycoprotein, and Envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among these peptides, 21 peptides had experimentally confirmed equivalent epitopes. Amongst, only nine peptides were predicted to bind to HLAs with known global allele frequency data, and three peptides were able to bind to experimentally confirmed HLAs of equivalent epitopes. Given the HLAs which have already been reported to be associated with ADs, the ESGLKTIL, RYPANSIV, NVAITRAK, and RRARSVAS were determined to be the most harmful peptides of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. It would be expected that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccination against this pathogen could significantly increase the ADs incidences, especially in populations harboring HLA-B*08:01, HLA-A*024:02, HLA-A*11:01 and HLA-B*27:05. The Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania are at higher risk of AD development."

4008,One or two dose regimen of the SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA vaccine INO-4800 protects against respiratory tract disease burden in nonhuman primate challenge model.,"Safe and effective vaccines will provide essential medical countermeasures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we assessed the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the intradermal delivery of INO-4800, a synthetic DNA vaccine candidate encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the rhesus macaque model. Single and 2 dose vaccination regimens were evaluated. Vaccination induced both binding and neutralizing antibodies, along with IFN-γ-producing T cells against SARS-CoV-2. Upon administration of a high viral dose (5 × 106 pfu) via the intranasal and intratracheal routes we observed significantly reduced virus load in the lung and throat, in the vaccinated animals compared to controls. 2 doses of INO-4800 was associated with more robust vaccine-induced immune responses and improved viral protection. Importantly, histopathological examination of lung tissue provided no indication of vaccine-enhanced disease following SARS-CoV-2 challenge in INO-4800 immunized animals. This vaccine candidate is currently under clinical evaluation as a 2 dose regimen."
4009,Factors Associated with the Delayed Termination of Viral Shedding in COVID-19 Patients with Mild Severity in South Korea.,"Background and objectives: We aimed to analyze factors associated with the period of viral shedding in patients with confirmed COVID-19 who experienced only mild symptoms. Materials and methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study from three community treatment centers (CTCs) of South Korea. All patients included were admitted to the three centers before 31 March 2020. We collected data about clinical characteristics and the result of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Viral shedding was terminated within 32 days and 36 days in 75% and 90% of patients, respectively (range: 8-49 days). The mean period of viral shedding was 23.8 ± 8.7 days. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the existence of underlying comorbidities lowered the probability of the termination of viral shedding (HR = 0.561, 95% CI 0.388-0.812). Female sex and presence of COVID-19-associated symptoms also lowered the probability, but the significance was marginal. Conclusions: The existence of underlying comorbidities was associated with delayed termination of viral shedding in COVID-19 patients with mild severity."
