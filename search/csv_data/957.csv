9563,Preparing for the next pandemic: Lessons from rapid scale-up of SARS-CoV-2 testing in a South African high-throughput automated HIV molecular laboratory.,"Africa's readiness to respond to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic was tested due to reliance on rapid turn-around-time of polymerase chain reaction results for clinical management, isolation and quarantine decisions. The NHLS HIV Molecular Laboratory in Johannesburg, South Africa, is one of the largest automated HIV molecular laboratories worldwide. Despite its extensive molecular capacity and experience in managing high volumes acquired from a large HIV program, significant challenges were encountered during its rapid transition to large scale SARS-CoV-2 testing. We describe the strategies employed to manage these challenges that resulted in a 30% improvement in SARS-CoV-2 test turn-around-time during the first wave peak during which approximately 25000 samples were tested per month, and further improvement during the second wave peak, with 81% within targeted turn-around-time."
9564,"Coordinated Strategy for a Model-Based Decision Support Tool for Coronavirus Disease, Utah, USA.","The coronavirus disease pandemic has highlighted the key role epidemiologic models play in supporting public health decision-making. In particular, these models provide estimates of outbreak potential when data are scarce and decision-making is critical and urgent. We document the integrated modeling response used in the US state of Utah early in the coronavirus disease pandemic, which brought together a diverse set of technical experts and public health and healthcare officials and led to an evidence-based response to the pandemic. We describe how we adapted a standard epidemiologic model; harmonized the outputs across modeling groups; and maintained a constant dialogue with policymakers at multiple levels of government to produce timely, evidence-based, and coordinated public health recommendations and interventions during the first wave of the pandemic. This framework continues to support the state's response to ongoing outbreaks and can be applied in other settings to address unique public health challenges."
9565,"Flavonols as potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteases (3CL(pro) and PL(pro)), spike protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor (ACE2).","The novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents the actual greatest global public health crisis. The lack of efficacious drugs and vaccines against this viral infection created a challenge for scientific researchers in order to find effective solutions. One of the promising therapeutic approaches is the search for bioactive molecules with few side effects that display antiviral properties in natural sources like medicinal plants and vegetables. Several computational and experimental studies indicated that flavonoids especially flavonols and their derivatives constitute effective viral enzyme inhibitors and possess interesting antiviral activities. In this context, the present study reviews the efficacy of many dietary flavonols as potential antiviral drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 enzymes and proteins including Chymotrypsin-Like Protease (3CLpro), Papain Like protease (PLpro), Spike protein (S protein) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and also their ability to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. The relationship between flavonol structures and their SARS-CoV-2 antiviral effects were discussed. On the other hand, the immunomodulatory, the anti-inflammatory and the antiviral effects of secondary metabolites from this class of flavonoids were reported. Also, their bioavailability limitations and toxicity were predicted."

9568,Targeting Polyamines Inhibits Coronavirus Infection by Reducing Cellular Attachment and Entry.,"Coronaviruses first garnered widespread attention in 2002 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from bats in China and rapidly spread in human populations. Since then, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged and still actively infects humans. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the resulting disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID19) have rapidly and catastrophically spread and highlighted significant limitations to our ability to control and treat infection. Thus, a basic understanding of entry and replication mechanisms of coronaviruses is necessary to rationally evaluate potential antivirals. Here, we show that polyamines, small metabolites synthesized in human cells, facilitate coronavirus replication and the depletion of polyamines with FDA-approved molecules significantly reduces coronavirus replication. We find that diverse coronaviruses, including endemic and epidemic coronaviruses, exhibit reduced attachment and entry into polyamine-depleted cells. We further demonstrate that several molecules targeting the polyamine biosynthetic pathway are antiviral in vitro. In sum, our data suggest that polyamines are critical to coronavirus replication and represent a highly promising drug target in the current and any future coronavirus outbreaks."
9569,Development of a large volume concentration method for recovery of coronavirus from wastewater.,"Levels of severe acute respiratory coronavirus type 2 (SARS CoV 2) RNA in wastewater could act as an effective means to monitor coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within communities. However, current methods used to detect SARS CoV 2 RNA in wastewater are limited in their ability to process sufficient volumes of source material, inhibiting our ability to assess viral load. Typically, viruses are concentrated from large liquid volumes using two stage concentration, primary and secondary. Here, we evaluated a dead-end hollow fiber ultrafilter (D-HFUF) for primary concentration, followed by the CP Select™ for secondary concentration from 2 L volumes of primary treated wastewater. Various amendments to each concentration procedure were investigated to optimally recover seeded OC43 (betacoronavirus) from wastewater. During primary concentration, the D-HFUF recovered 69 ± 18% (n = 29) of spiked OC43 from 2 L of wastewater. For secondary concentration, the CP Select™ system using the Wastewater Application settings was capable of processing 100 mL volumes of primary filter eluates in <25 min. A hand-driven syringe elution proved to be significantly superior (p = 0.0299) to the CP Select™ elution for recovering OC43 from filter eluates, 48 ± 2% compared to 31 ± 3%, respectively. For the complete method (primary and secondary concentration combined), the D-HFUF and CP select/syringe elution achieved overall 22 ± 4% recovery of spiked OC43 through (n = 8) replicate filters. Given the lack of available standardized methodology confounded by the inherent limitations of relying on viral RNA for wastewater surveillance of SARS CoV 2, it is important to acknowledge these challenges when interpreting this data to estimate community infection rates. However, the development of methods that can substantially increase sample volumes will likely allow for reporting of quantifiable viral data for wastewater surveillance, equipping public health officials with information necessary to better estimate community infection rates."
