710,Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva using a guanidium based transport medium suitable for RT-PCR diagnostic assays.,"Background: Upper respiratory samples used to test for SARS-CoV-2 virus may be infectious and present a hazard during transport and testing. A buffer with the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at the time of sample collection could simplify and expand testing for COVID-19 to non-conventional settings. Methods: We evaluated a guanidium thiocyanate-based buffer, eNAT™ (Copan) as a possible transport and inactivation medium for downstream Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 in eNAT and in diluted saliva was studied at different incubation times. The stability of viral RNA in eNAT was also evaluated for up to 7 days at room temperature (28°C), refrigerated conditions (4°C) and at 35°C. Results: SARS-COV-2 virus spiked directly in eNAT could be inactivated at >5.6 log10 PFU/ml within a minute of incubation. When saliva was diluted 1:1 in eNAT, no cytopathic effect (CPE) on VeroE6 cells was observed, although SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected even after 30 min incubation and after two cell culture passages. A 1:2 (saliva:eNAT) dilution abrogated both CPE and detectable viral RNA after as little as 5 min incubation in eNAT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virus spiked at 5X the limit of detection remained positive up to 7 days of incubation in all tested conditions. Conclusion: eNAT and similar guanidinium thiocyanate-based media may be of value for transport, stabilization, and processing of clinical samples for RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection."
711,The Spike of SARS-CoV-2: Uniqueness and Applications.,"The Spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is critical for its ability to attach and fuse into the host cells, leading to infection, and transmission. In this review, we have initially performed a meta-analysis of keywords associated with the S protein to frame the outline of important research findings and directions related to it. Based on this outline, we have reviewed the structure, uniqueness, and origin of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interactions of the Spike protein with host and its implications in COVID-19 pathogenesis, as well as drug and vaccine development, are discussed. We have also summarized the recent advances in detection methods using S protein-based RT-PCR, ELISA, point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay, and graphene-based field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors. Finally, we have also discussed the emerging Spike mutants and the efficacy of the Spike-based vaccines against those strains. Overall, we have covered most of the recent advances on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and its possible implications in countering this virus."
712,COVID-19 testing and diagnosis: A comparison of current approaches.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a novel coronavirus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation since March 2020. To date, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has exceeded 47 million and more than 1.2 million people have lost their lives to the disease. The disease is spreading at an exponential rate with no signs of slowing down. COVID-19 testing and early diagnosis play a crucial role in not just patient management, but also the prevention of the further spread of the disease. Various diagnostic approaches have been applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. This article will critically review these diagnostic approaches and compare each with the gold-standard, which is viral RNA detection using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)."
713,SARS-CoV-2 screening of asymptomatic women admitted for delivery must be performed with a combination of microbiological techniques: an observational study.,"Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the value of systematic screening in asymptomatic women admitted for spontaneous delivery with a combination of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cycle threshold (Ct) and serum antibodies. Methods: Since May 6 all women admitted for spontaneous delivery underwent RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs and specific antibodies IgG of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in serum that were performed as part of routine clinical care in our institution. Ct of the PCR was recorded. We analyzed the first 100 women consecutively admitted for spontaneous delivery at our institution. Results: Nine women were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples (9%) and 13 (13%) presented positive specific antibodies of the coronavirus. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 prior exposure was 15%. The Ct determination (RT-PCR test) of our 9 positive patients ranged from 36 to 41 cycles with a median of 40. Vaginal delivery occurred in 94% of the cases and only 6% underwent a cesarean section, always for obstetric reasons. No fetal transmission was observed and maternal and neonatal prognosis was excellent. Conclusions: During epidemic episodes in asymptomatic women in labor, universal testing with RT-PCR (considering Ct determination), and the detection of antibodies, permits a better interpretation of the results and avoid unnecessary isolation procedures."

716,Rapid visual detection of SARS-CoV-2 by colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification.,"Evaluation of the performance of a new set of primers defined from the ORF1ab sequence, and its combination with a previously published set of primers from the N sequence, to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique is presented. The ORF1ab primer set enables visual detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 16 min. In addition, a simultaneous reaction with both ORF1ab and N primers allows for higher sensitivity of detection, particularly when low numbers of copies are present (250 viral RNA copies). Further, the protocol is able to detect viral RNA in saliva samples. The procedure reported could be easily implemented in the generation of a new and sensitive rapid point-of care device for SARS-CoV-2 RNA visual detection."
717,Clinical Characteristics and Viral RNA Detection in Children With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in the Republic of Korea.,"Importance: There is limited information describing the full spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in children. Objective: To analyze the full clinical course and the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectability in children confirmed with COVID-19 in the Republic of Korea, where rigorous public health interventions have been implemented. Design, setting, and participants: This case series of children with COVID-19 was conducted in 20 hospitals and 2 nonhospital isolation facilities across the country from February 18, 2020, to March 31, 2020. Children younger than 19 years who had COVID-19 were included. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19, detected via SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab or sputum by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical manifestations during the observation period, including the time and duration of symptom occurrence. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was also analyzed. Results: A total of 91 children with COVID-19 were included (median [range] age, 11 [0-18] years; 53 boys [58%]). Twenty children (22%) were asymptomatic during the entire observation period. Among 71 symptomatic cases, 47 children (66%) had unrecognized symptoms before diagnosis, 18 (25%) developed symptoms after diagnosis, and only 6 (9%) were diagnosed at the time of symptom onset. Twenty-two children (24%) had lower respiratory tract infections. The mean (SD) duration of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory samples was 17.6 (6.7) days. Virus RNA was detected for a mean (SD) of 14.1 (7.7) days in asymptomatic individuals. There was no difference in the duration of virus RNA detection between children with upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections (mean [SD], 18.7 [5.8] days vs 19.9 [5.6] days; P = .54). Fourteen children (15%) were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and/or hydroxychloroquine. All recovered, without any fatal cases. Conclusions and relevance: In this case series study, inapparent infections in children may have been associated with silent COVID-19 transmission in the community. Heightened surveillance using laboratory screening will allow detection in children with unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 infection."
718,Is a COVID-19 vaccine developed by nature already at work?,"The COVID-19 positive cases are increasing at an alarming rate across the world. On the contrary, the morbidity and mortality are showing decreasing trend as time progresses. The most intriguing part is the rise in asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive cases in the population, which made us speculate some kind of gradual development of immunity in the population. To date, no attention has been given to the accumulation of killed/inactivated/degenerated SARS-CoV-2 associated molecular particle patterns (SAMPPs). In this paper, we introduced the concept of SAMMPs and its existence on inanimate objects is quite conceivable due to the size of SARS-CoV-2 and exuberant shedding of the virus in respiratory secretions. SAMPPs can come into the contact with mucosal surfaces and thereof associated antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Thus, we hypothesized the existence of SAMPPs mediated the development of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has caused an increase in the incidence rate of asymptomatic cases and a decrease in mortality rate. To understand the existence of SAMPPs associated natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2, future population based serological testing are recommended to investigate serum antibody levels against various molecular particles associated with SAMPPs."
719,Clinical and laboratory findings and PCR results in severe and non-severe COVID19 patients based on CURB-65 and WHO severity indices.,"Background: The importance of clinicolaboratory characteristics of COVID-19 made us report our findings in the Alborz province according to the latest National Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in outpatients and inpatients (trial five versions, 25 March 2020) of Iran by emphasizing rRT-PCR results, clinical features, comorbidities, and other laboratory findings in patients according to the severity of the disease. Methods: In this study, 202 patients were included, primarily of whom 164 had fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This cross-sectional, two-center study that involved 164 symptomatic adults hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 5 and April 5, 2020, was performed to analyze the frequency of rRT-PCR results, distribution of comorbidities, and initial clinicolaboratory data in severe and non-severe cases, comparing the compatibility of two methods for categorizing the severity of the disease. Results: According to our findings, 111 patients were rRT-PCR positive (67.6%), and 53 were rRT-PCR negative (32.4%), indicating no significant difference between severity groups that were not related to the date of symptoms' onset before admission. Based on the National Guideline, among vital signs and symptoms, mean oxygen saturation and frequency of nausea showed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05); however, no significant difference was observed in comorbidities. In CURB-65 groups, among vital signs and comorbidities, mean oxygen saturation, diabetes, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, chronic heart disease (CHD), and asthma showed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was seen in symptoms. Conclusion: In this study, rRT-PCR results of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were not related to severity categories. From initial clinical characteristics, decreased oxygen saturation appears to be a more common abnormality in severe and non-severe categories. National Guideline indices seem to be more comprehensive to categorize patients in severity groups than CURB-65, and there was compatibility just in non-severe groups of National Guideline and CURB-65 categories."
