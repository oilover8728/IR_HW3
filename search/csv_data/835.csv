8340,Immune response induced by oral administration with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in mice.,"Background: The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights the need to develop safe and effective vaccines with a top priority. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, and several vaccines are currently available. Efforts need to be undertaken to counter the threat of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Results: We generated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, EBY100/pYD1-RBD, in which the full-length receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was expressed on the surface of yeast. Mice vaccinated orally with unadjuvanted EBY100/pYD1-RBD could produce significant humoral and mucosal responses as well as robust cellular immune responses. Notably, EBY100/pYD1-RBD elicited a mixed Th1/Th2-type cellular immune response with a Th1-biased immune response in a mouse model. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of the RBD as a key target to design and develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and provide evidence of oral administration of a S. cerevisiae-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine eliciting significant immune responses. Most importantly, the S. cerevisiae surface display system can serve as a universal technology platform and be applied to develop other oral viral or bacterial vaccines."
8341,Suitability of databases in the Asia-Pacific for collaborative monitoring of vaccine safety.,"Introduction: Information regarding availability of electronic healthcare databases in the Asia-Pacific region is critical for planning vaccine safety assessments particularly, as COVID-19 vaccines are introduced. This study aimed to identify data sources in the region, potentially suitable for vaccine safety surveillance. This manuscript is endorsed by the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology (ISPE). Methods: Nineteen countries targeted for database reporting were identified using published country lists and review articles. Surveillance capacity was assessed using two surveys: a 9-item introductory survey and a 51-item full survey. Survey questions related to database characteristics, covariate and health outcome variables, vaccine exposure characteristics, access and governance, and dataset linkage capability. Other questions collated research/regulatory applications of the data and local publications detailing database use for research. Results: Eleven databases containing vaccine-specific information were identified across 8 countries. Databases were largely national in coverage (8/11, 73%), encompassed all ages (9/11, 82%) with population size from 1.4 to 52 million persons. Vaccine exposure information varied particularly for standardized vaccine codes (5/11, 46%), brand (7/11, 64%) and manufacturer (5/11, 46%). Outcome data were integrated with vaccine data in 6 (55%) databases and available via linkage in 5 (46%) databases. Data approval processes varied, impacting on timeliness of data access. Conclusions: Variation in vaccine data availability, complexities in data access including, governance and data release approval procedures, together with requirement for data linkage for outcome information, all contribute to the challenges in building a distributed network for vaccine safety assessment in the Asia-Pacific and globally. Common data models (CDMs) may help expedite vaccine safety research across the region."
8342,3CL hydrolase-based multiepitope peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoinformatics.,"The present study provides the first multiepitope vaccine construct using the 3CL hydrolase protein of SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) enzyme is essential for proteolytic maturation of the virus. This study was based on immunoinformatics and structural vaccinology strategies. The design of the multiepitope vaccine was built using helper T-cell and cytotoxic T-cell epitopes from the 3CL hydrolase protein along with an adjuvant to enhance immune response; these are joined to each other by short peptide linkers. The vaccine also carries potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes, and interferon-Î³-inducing epitopes. Epitopes of the constructed multiepitope vaccine were found to be antigenic, nonallergic, nontoxic, and covering large human populations worldwide. The vaccine construct was modeled, validated, and refined by different programs to achieve a high-quality three-dimensional structure. The resulting high-quality model was applied for conformational B-cell epitope selection and docking analyses with toll-like receptor-3 for understanding the capability of the vaccine to elicit an immune response. In silico cloning and codon adaptation were also performed with the pET-19b plasmid vector. The designed multiepitope peptide vaccine may prompt the development of a vaccine to control SARS-CoV-2 infection."
8343,"Vaccine complacency and dose distribution inequities limit the benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination, despite a positive trend in use.","Sustainable demand for seasonal influenza vaccines is a component of national security strategies for pandemic preparedness. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has revealed many weaknesses in the capacity of countries to design and execute sustainable vaccination programs. An influenza pandemic remains a global threat and yet there is no global monitoring system for assessing progress towards influenza vaccination coverage targets. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations' (IFPMA) Influenza Vaccine Supply International Task Force (IVS) developed a survey method in 2008 to estimate seasonal influenza vaccination coverage rates, which in turn serves as a crude estimate of pandemic preparedness. It provides evidence to guide expanded efforts for pandemic preparedness, specifically for increasing COVID-19 vaccine immunization levels. Furthermore, the results presented herein serve as a proxy for assessing the state of pandemic preparedness at a global and regional level. This paper adds data from 2018 and 2019 to the previous analyses. The current data show an upward or stable global trend in seasonal influenza vaccine dose distributed per 1,000 population with a 7% increase between 2017 and 2018 and 6% increase between 2018 and 2019. However, considerable regional inequities in access to vaccine persist. Three regions, Africa, the Middle-east, and Southeast Asia together account for 50% of the global population but only 6% of distributed seasonal influenza vaccine doses. This is an important finding in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as distribution of influenza vaccine doses in many ways reflects access to COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, improving seasonal vaccine uptake rates is critical for optimizing the annual benefits by reducing the huge annual influenza-associated societal burdens and by providing protection to vulnerable individuals against serious complications from seasonal influenza infections."
8344,A review of COVID-19 convalescent plasma use in COVID-19 with focus on proof of efficacy.,"Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is rapidly becoming an established consideration in the treatment of COVID-19 patients though there is a need to critically review this area for proof of efficacy. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) present in CP generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein are considered to play main role in viral clearance. CP infusion may also help in the modulation of immune response by its immunomodulatory effect. The FDA allows for administration of CP to COVID-19 patients. The present published literature in COVID-19 is limited to case series and randomised controlled trial where plasma therapy was used in moderate, severe and critically ill patients. Though multiple uncertainties exist regarding to its efficacy, appropriate donor selection and NAb titres, the efficacy data of CP use inCOVID-19 is limited having shown hope with early and severe to critically ill COVID-19 patients."
8345,Structure and regulation of coronavirus genomes: state-of-the-art and novel insights from SARS-CoV-2 studies.,"Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, harboring the largest viral RNA genomes known to date. Apart from the primary sequence encoding for all the viral proteins needed for the generation of new viral particles, certain regions of CoV genomes are known to fold into stable structures, controlling several aspects of CoV life cycle, from the regulation of the discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs, to the packaging of the genome into new virions. Here we review the current knowledge on CoV RNA structures, discussing it in light of the most recent discoveries made possible by analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genome."
8346,Integrated network analysis reveals new genes suggesting COVID-19 chronic effects and treatment.,"The COVID-19 disease led to an unprecedented health emergency, still ongoing worldwide. Given the lack of a vaccine or a clear therapeutic strategy to counteract the infection as well as its secondary effects, there is currently a pressing need to generate new insights into the SARS-CoV-2 induced host response. Biomedical data can help to investigate new aspects of the COVID-19 pathogenesis, but source heterogeneity represents a major drawback and limitation. In this work, we applied data integration methods to develop a Unified Knowledge Space (UKS) and used it to identify a new set of genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 host response, both in vitro and in vivo. Functional analysis of these genes reveals possible long-term systemic effects of the infection, such as vascular remodelling and fibrosis. Finally, we identified a set of potentially relevant drugs targeting proteins involved in multiple steps of the host response to the virus."
8347,Potential role of interferons in treating COVID-19 patients.,"The recently public health crises in the world is emerged by spreading the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also named COVID-19. The virus is originated in bats and transported to humans via undefined intermediate animals. This virus can produce from weak to severe respiratory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), pneumonia and even death in patients. The COVID-19 disease is distributed by inhalation via contaminated droplets or contact with infected environment. The incubation time is from 2 to 14 day and the symptoms are typically fever, sore throat, cough, malaise, fatigue, breathlessness among others. It needs to be considered that many infected people are asymptomatic. Developing various immunological and virological methods to diagnose this disease is supported by several laboratories. Treatment is principally supportive; however, there are several agents that are using in treating of COVID-19 patients. Interferons (IFNs) have shown to be crucial in fighting with COVID-19 disease and can be a suitable candidate in treatment of these patients. Combination therapy can be more effective than monotherapy to cure this disease. Prevention necessitates to be performed by isolation of suspected people and home quarantine as well as taking care to infected people with mild or strict disease at hospitals. As the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has accelerated, developing effective therapy is an urgent requirement to battle the virus and prevent further pandemic. In this manuscript we reviewed available information about SARS-CoV-2 and probable therapies for COVID-19 patients."
8348,Convalescent Plasma and Coronavirus Disease 2019: Time for Reassessment.,
8349,[Research on coronavirus disease 2019 field disinfection technology for prevention and control].,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has had a serious impact in the world. In the absence of vaccines and therapeutic drugs, disinfection has become an important technical means to block the spread of the virus. By analyzing the characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we studied a series of disinfection technologies for COVID-19. During the outbreak of COVID-19, Jinan Second Center for Disease Control and Prevention disinfected the houses of the cases to be investigated in a community. The effectiveness of the disinfection technology was verified through the process of disinfection preparation, sampling before disinfection, field disinfection, sampling after disinfection and evaluation of disinfection effect. Compared the data before and after disinfection, the killing rate of the total bacterial colonies in the air and on the surface of the object was more than or equal to 90%, and no SARS-CoV-2 was detected after disinfection. The results show that the disinfection effect of the disinfection technology meets the standard. Finally, through the analysis of the wrong way of disinfection and the harm of over disinfection, the importance of scientific disinfection and precise disinfection are emphasized, and the research has a good guiding value for prevention and control of the epidemic."
