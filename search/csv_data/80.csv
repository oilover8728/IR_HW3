790,Recent Advances in Novel Lateral Flow Technologies for Detection of COVID-19.,"The development of reliable and robust diagnostic tests is one of the most efficient methods to limit the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, most laboratory diagnostics for COVID-19, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are expensive, time-consuming, and require highly trained professional operators. On the other hand, the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a simpler, cheaper device that can be operated by unskilled personnel easily. Unfortunately, the current technique has some limitations, mainly inaccuracy in detection. This review article aims to highlight recent advances in novel lateral flow technologies for detecting SARS-CoV-2 as well as innovative approaches to achieve highly sensitive and specific point-of-care testing. Lastly, we discuss future perspectives on how smartphones and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be integrated to revolutionize disease detection as well as disease control and surveillance."
791,Positive Ratio of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Validity of Pre-Screening Criteria at an Outpatient Screening Center during the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Japan.,"Despite the increase in COVID-19 cases globally, the number of cases in Japan has been relatively low, and an explosive surge in the prevalence has not occurred. In March 2020, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan recommended the original criteria for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, although there was a lack of evidence for appropriate targets for COVID-19 testing. This study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 positive ratio and pre-screening criteria in Tokyo immediately after the insurance-covered SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing became available in Japan. We subjected 277 individuals with mild symptoms in metropolitan Tokyo (positive: 9.0%) from March 9 to 29, 2020, to SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. The results revealed that 25 (9.0%) of them were PCR-positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the MHLW criteria were 100% and 10.7%, respectively. When the criteria excluded nonspecific symptoms, fatigue, and dyspnea, the sensitivity slightly decreased to 92%, and the specificity increased to 22.2%. The specificity was highest when the fever criterion was ≥37.5°C for ≥4 days, and exposure/travel history, including age and underlying comorbidities, was considered. Our findings suggest that the MHLW criteria, including the symptoms and exposure/travel history, may be useful for COVID-19 pre-screening."
792,Novel indel mutation in the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples that were diagnosed positive in a commercial RT-PCR assay.,"Commercially available reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits are being used as an important tool to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical laboratories worldwide. However, some kits lack sufficient clinical evaluation due to the need for emergency use caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here we found that a novel insertion/deletion mutation in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 samples is a cause of negative results for the N gene in a widely used assay that received emergency use authorization (EUA) from US FDA and Conformite Europeenne-in vitro diagnostics (CE-IVD) from EU. Although SARS-CoV-2 is diagnosed positive by other target probes in the assay, our findings provide an evidence of the genetic variability and rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as well as a reference in designing commercial RT-PCR assays."
793,Therapeutic and Vaccine Options for COVID-19: Status after Six Months of the Disease Outbreak.,"An outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by an infection of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This new virus belongs to the group of enveloped RNA beta-coronaviruses. Symptoms may differ in various infected persons, but major presentations include dry cough, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, fever, and general malaise. The disease appears to be more severe in patients above the age of 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. There is still no approved vaccine against COVID-19, but more than a hundred are at different stages of development. It is known that the development of new drugs takes a relatively long time, so several known and already-approved drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of this disease. In this review, we explore the therapeutic and vaccine options that are available for COVID-19 6 months after its outbreak. Most noteworthy among the therapeutic options are dexamethasone, remdesivir, Avigan (favipiravir) and convalescent plasma."
794,Specific allelic discrimination of N501Y and other SARS-CoV-2 mutations by ddPCR detects B.1.1.7 lineage in Washington State.,"Real-time epidemiological tracking of variants of concern (VOCs) can help limit the spread of more contagious forms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), such as those containing the N501Y mutation. Typically, genetic sequencing is required to be able to track VOCs in real-time. However, sequencing can take time and may not be accessible in all laboratories. Genotyping by RT-ddPCR offers an alternative to rapidly detect VOCs through discrimination of specific alleles such as N501Y, which is associated with increased transmissibility and virulence. Here we describe the first cases of the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Washington State by using a combination of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RT-ddPCR, and next-generation sequencing. We initially screened 1035 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by our CDC-based laboratory-developed assay using ThermoFisher's multiplex RT-PCR COVID-19 assay over four weeks from late December 2020 to early January 2021. S gene target failures (SGTF) were subsequently assayed by RT-ddPCR to confirm four mutations within the S gene associated with the B.1.1.7 lineage: a deletion at amino acid (AA) 69-70 (ACATGT), deletion at AA 145, (TTA), N501Y mutation (TAT), and S982A mutation (GCA). All four targets were detected in two specimens; follow-up sequencing revealed a total of 9 mutations in the S gene and phylogenetic clustering within the B.1.1.7 lineage. Next, we continued screening samples for SGTF detecting 23 additional B.1.1.7 variants by RT-ddPCR and confirmed by sequencing. As VOCs become increasingly prevalent, molecular diagnostic tools like RT-ddPCR can be utilized to quickly, accurately, and sensitively distinguish more contagious lineages of SARS-CoV-2."
795,Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR Using Different Sample Sources: Review of the Literature.,"Objective: The most widely used diagnostic technique for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It can be done on different samples: nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) or oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), and self-collected saliva. However, negative findings do not rule out infection. Methods: A review was conceived to discuss advantages and limitations of the available diagnostic modalities for nonserologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR; the article also proposes some practical suggestions to improve diagnostic reliability. Results: A total of 16 papers (corresponding to 452 patients) of the 56 initially identified were included. Most of the papers describe findings from different samples obtained in limited case series; comparative studies are missing. Conclusions: Diagnostic accuracy of NPS and OPS is suboptimal and the risk of contaminated aerosol dispersal is not negligible. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found in self-collected saliva specimens of many infected patients within 7 to 10 days after symptom onset. There is an urgent need for comparative trials to define the diagnostic modality of choice. Adequate education and training of health care personnel is mandatory."
796,Fast-track ruling in/out SARS-CoV-2 infection with rapid 0/1.5 h molecular test in patients with acute coronary syndromes.,"Aims: Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) often arrive in the catheterization (cath) lab directly from the field or an emergency department without an accurate triage for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Although in the pandemic period the treatment in the cath laboratory of high-risk ACS should not be delayed because the operators wear special protection systems, the subsequent risk of contagion in a non-Covid coronary care unit could be high in the case of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We tested the possibility of a fast-track protocol in 51 consecutive patients (mean age 65 ± 12 years) transferred from spokes centres or from the field to our HUB centre and admitted to our coronary care unit (CCU). Once the patient had arrived in the cath lab, the nasopharyngeal swab was performed. The real-time PCR to extract RNA for SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed with an automated rapid molecular Xpert Xpress test. Meanwhile, coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention was performed if necessary. Results: In this fast-track protocol, the time to perform nasopharyngeal swab was 11 ± 11 min; time spent to transport nasopharyngeal swab to the laboratory was 29 ± 20 min; time to detect viral nucleic acid was 68 ± 16 min. The overall time from the execution of nasopharyngeal swab to the result was 109 ± 26 min. The results were immediately put into the hospital computer system and made readily available. Depending on the test result, patients were then transferred to the regular CCU or Covid area. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that 0-1.5 h fast-track triage for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is feasible in patients with ACS. The execution of nasopharyngeal swab in the cath lab and its analysis with a rapid molecular test allows rapid stratification of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
797,Assessment of an Online Tool to Simulate the Effect of Pooled Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Populations.,This diagnostic study describes an online tool created with actual severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus copy number data to help policy makers understand how pooled testing compares with single-sample testing in different populations.
798,A plug-and-play platform of ratiometric bioluminescent sensors for homogeneous immunoassays.,"Heterogeneous immunoassays such as ELISA have become indispensable in modern bioanalysis, yet translation into point-of-care assays is hindered by their dependence on external calibration and multiple washing and incubation steps. Here, we introduce RAPPID (Ratiometric Plug-and-Play Immunodiagnostics), a mix-and-measure homogeneous immunoassay platform that combines highly specific antibody-based detection with a ratiometric bioluminescent readout. The concept entails analyte-induced complementation of split NanoLuc luciferase fragments, photoconjugated to an antibody sandwich pair via protein G adapters. Introduction of a calibrator luciferase provides a robust ratiometric signal that allows direct in-sample calibration and quantitative measurements in complex media such as blood plasma. We developed RAPPID sensors that allow low-picomolar detection of several protein biomarkers, anti-drug antibodies, therapeutic antibodies, and both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. With its easy-to-implement standardized workflow, RAPPID provides an attractive, fast, and low-cost alternative to traditional immunoassays, in an academic setting, in clinical laboratories, and for point-of-care applications."
799,Reduction in COVID-19 prevalence in healthcare workers in a university hospital in southern Brazil after the start of vaccination.,"Introduction: The quick spread of SARS-CoV-2 led to the development of vaccines that are capable of reducing infection and the number of more severe COVID-19 cases. Aim: To assess COVID-19 prevalence among healthcare workers (HCWs) after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study on the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosis among 7523 HCWs vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 with CoronaVac and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in a university hospital, in southern Brazil, between January 18 and March 18, 2021.The variables evaluated were: sex, age, work area, role, source of infection, previous diagnosis of COVID-19, date of vaccine administration, type of vaccine, and need for hospitalization. The statistical analysis used Poisson regression and Fisher's exact test with SPSS software version 25, and a level of significance set at 5%. Results: 813 vaccinated HCWs showed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, of whom 35.4% (288) had a detectable result after undergoing RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. There was a reduction of 62% in new cases of COVID-19 among HCWs in the institution 7 weeks after the start of vaccine rollout. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the vaccines used by the institution reduced the number of COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the vaccines."
