2723,Failure to Detect Viral RNA in Follicular Fluid Aspirates from a SARS-CoV-2-Positive Woman.,"Although there is no known difference between the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant and non-pregnant women based on the studies published until now, in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments were suspended during the pandemic due to uncertainties with the suggestions of associated societies. However, we do not have enough data on the exact effects of SARS-CoV-2 on fertility and pregnancy and whether there are damaging effects on IVF outcome. There is no available evidence about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by either sexual way or through intrauterine insemination (IUI) or IVF. Up until now, there is no report to document the presence or absence of viral RNA in follicular fluid of SARS-CoV-2-positive women. In this paper, we present a case of oocyte retrieval from a SARS-CoV-2-positive woman and the search for viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the follicular fluid aspirates."
2724,"Optimal symptom combinations to aid COVID-19 case identification: Analysis from a community-based, prospective, observational cohort.","Objectives: Diagnostic work-up following any COVID-19 associated symptom will lead to extensive testing, potentially overwhelming laboratory capacity whilst primarily yielding negative results. We aimed to identify optimal symptom combinations to capture most cases using fewer tests with implications for COVID-19 vaccine developers across different resource settings and public health. Methods: UK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset symptoms and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one case (test per case [TPC]) were calculated for different symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was applied to generate combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity. Findings: UK and US cohorts included 122,305 (1,202 positives) and 3,162 (79 positive) individuals. Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47 TPC. The combination with highest sensitivity (fatigue, anosmia/ageusia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, sore throat) identified 96% cases requiring 96 TPC. Interpretation: We confirmed the significance of COVID-19 specific symptoms for triggering RT-PCR and identified additional symptom combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity that maximize case capture given different resource settings."
2725,COVID-19: laboratory diagnosis for clinicians. An updating article.,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviridae comprises a large family, of which at least seven members are known to cause respiratory diseases in humans. Coronaviruses have the ability to infect virtually all major groups of animals and, eventually, can infect humans. SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus to cross the species barrier and infect humans. This virus was identified in an outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. Its entire genome is inscribed on a single strand of ribonucleic acid. Some proteins present on the surface of the virus act as facilitators for its entry into host cells, while others, apparently, are related to its pathogenesis. Coronaviruses are responsible for respiratory infections in humans and some animals. The infection is often mild to moderate in intensity, but some coronaviruses may cause serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which occurred in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses can activate an excessive and unregulated immune response, which may promote SARS development. Although the lungs are one of the target organs, the hypoxia mechanism is systemic and other organs begin to suffer both through lack of oxygen and through deregulation of inflammation control mechanisms."
2726,Challenge Trials: What Are the Ethical Problems?,"If, as is alleged, challenge trials of vaccines against COVID-19 are likely to save thousands of lives and vastly diminish the economic and social harms of the pandemic while subjecting volunteers to risks that are comparable to kidney donation, then it would seem that the only sensible objection to such trials would be to deny that they have low risks or can be expected to have immense benefits. This essay searches for a philosophical rationale for rejecting challenge trials while supposing that they have huge benefits and relatively low risks. Although it finds some force in objections to challenge trials grounded in the obligations of researchers to limit the harms imposed on some individuals for the benefit of others, it argues that there is no compelling objection to challenge trials of vaccines for COVID-19-if they have the benefits and risks that have been claimed."

2728,"Accelerated COVID-19 vaccine development: milestones, lessons, and prospects.","The development of effective vaccines to combat infectious diseases is a complex multi-year and multi-stakeholder process. To accelerate the development of vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel pathogen emerging in late 2019 and spreading globally by early 2020, the United States government (USG) mounted an operation bridging public and private sector expertise and infrastructure. The success of the endeavor can be seen in the rapid advanced development of multiple vaccine candidates, with several demonstrating efficacy and now being administered around the globe. Here, we review the milestones enabling the USG-led effort, the methods utilized, and ensuing outcomes. We discuss the current status of COVID-19 vaccine development and provide a perspective for how partnership and preparedness can be better utilized in response to future public-health pandemic emergencies."
2729,What containment strategy leads us through the pandemic crisis? An empirical analysis of the measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Since January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has been progressing at a rapid pace. To keep the pandemic at bay, countries have implemented various measures to interrupt the transmission of the virus from person to person and prevent an overload of their health systems. We analyze the impact of these measures implemented against the COVID-19 pandemic by using a sample of 68 countries, Puerto Rico and the 50 federal states of the United States of America, four federal states of Australia, and eight federal states of Canada, involving 6,941 daily observations. We show that measures are essential for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. After controlling for daily COVID-19 tests, we find evidence to suggest that school closures, shut-downs of non-essential business, mass gathering bans, travel restrictions in and out of risk areas, national border closures and/or complete entry bans, and nationwide curfews decrease the growth rate of the coronavirus and thus the peak of daily confirmed cases. We also find evidence to suggest that combinations of these measures decrease the daily growth rate at a level outweighing that of individual measures. Consequently, and despite extensive vaccinations, we contend that the implemented measures help contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and ease the overstressed capacity of the healthcare systems."
