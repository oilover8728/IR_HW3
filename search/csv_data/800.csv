7990,The cardiovascular disorders and prognostic cardiac biomarkers in COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a worldwide epidemic disease affecting increasing number of patients. Although the virus primarily targets respiratory system, cardiovascular involvement has been reported in accumulating studies. In this review, we first describe the cardiac disorders in human with various types of CoV infection, and in animals infected with coronavirus. Particularly, we will focus on the association of cardiovascular disorders upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and prognostic cardiac biomarkers in COVID-19. Besides, we will discuss the possible mechanisms underlying cardiac injury resulted from SARS-CoV-2 infection including direct myocardial injury caused by viral infection, reduced level of ACE2, and inflammatory response during infection. Improved understandings of cardiac disorders associated with COVID-19 might predict clinical outcome and provide insights into more rational treatment responses in clinical practice."
7991,The role of autophagy in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection: An overview on virophagy-mediated molecular drug targets.,"Autophagy-dependent cell death is a prominent mechanism that majorly contributes to homeostasis by maintaining the turnover of organelles under stressful conditions. Several viruses, including coronaviruses (CoVs), take advantage of cellular autophagy to facilitate their own replication. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a beta-coronavirus (β-CoVs) that mediates its replication through a dependent or independent ATG5 pathway using specific double-membrane vesicles that can be considered as similar to autophagosomes. With due attention to several mutations in NSP6, a nonstructural protein with a positive regulatory effect on autophagosome formation, a potential correlation between SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis mechanisms and autophagy can be expected. Certain medications, albeit limited in number, have been indicated to negatively regulate autophagy flux, potentially in a way similar to the inhibitory effect of β-CoVs on the process of autophagy. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support their direct antagonizing effect on CoVs. Off-target accumulation of a major fraction of FDA-approved autophagy modulating drugs may result in adverse effects. Therefore, medications that have modulatory effects on autophagy could be considered as potential lead compounds for the development of new treatments against this virus. This review discusses the role of autophagy/virophagy in controlling SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the potential therapeutic implications."
7992,RT-qPCR Testing of SARS-CoV-2: A Primer.,"Testing for the presence of coronavirus is an essential diagnostic tool for monitoring and managing the current COVID-19 pandemic. The only reliable test in current use for testing acute infection targets the genome of SARS-CoV-2, and the most widely used method is quantitative fluorescence-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Despite its ubiquity, there is a significant amount of uncertainty about how this test works, potential throughput and reliability. This has resulted in widespread misrepresentation of the problems faced using this test during the current COVID-19 epidemic. This primer provides simple, straightforward and impartial information about RT-qPCR."
7993,Oral manifestations of COVID-19: Brief review.,"The infection with a new type of virus - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first described in December 2019, in Wuhan, China. Due to the gastrointestinal mucosa tropism of the virus, an attempt was made to describe the oral manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which permits the attachment of the virus, is present also in the oral cavity. There are many symptoms in the oral cavity; among them, the most prevalent ones are dysgeusia (taste disorders), oral pain, the exacerbation of autoimmune diseases as well as the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections. Ulcerations and aphthous stomatitis are also often mentioned. The research shows that there are many oral symptoms in COVID-19, but the coexistence with the main disease has not been fully stated and understood. There is still no clearance on whether the oral symptoms are the manifestations of the disease or occur due to the loss of the immune response. Therefore, further studies on this subject should be conducted."

7995,Ethanol Susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Enveloped Viruses.,"Ethanol is an effective disinfectant against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. However, its effective concentration has not been shown, and we therefore analyzed the effects of different concentrations of ethanol on SARS-CoV-2. When SARS-CoV-2 was treated with varying ethanol concentrations and examined for changes in infectivity, the ethanol concentration at which 99% of the infectious titers were reduced was 24.1% (w/w) [29.3% (v/v)]. For reference, ethanol susceptibility was also examined with other envelope viruses, including influenza virus, vesicular stomatitis virus in the family Rhabdoviridae, and Newcastle disease virus in the family Paramyxoviridae, and the 99% inhibitory concentrations were found to be 28.8%(w/w) [34.8% (v/v)], 24.0% (w/w) [29.2% (v/v)], and 13.3% (w/w) [16.4% (v/v)], respectively. Some differences from SARS-CoV-2 were observed, but the differences were not significant. It was concluded that ethanol at a concentration of 30%(w/w) [36.2% (v/v)] almost completely inactivates SARS-CoV-2."
7996,An enlightening role for cytokine storm in coronavirus infection.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, China has dispersed rapidly worldwide. Although most patients present with mild fever, cough with varying pulmonary shadows, a significant portion still develops severe respiratory dysfunction. And these severe cases are often associated with manifestations outside the respiratory tract. Currently, it is not difficult to find inflammatory cytokines upregulated in the blood of infected patients. However, some complications in addition to respiratory system with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are impossible to explain or cannot be attributed to virus itself. Thus excessive cytokines and their potentially fatal adverse effects are probably the answer to the multiple organ dysfunctions and growing mortality. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying cytokine storm, summarizes its pathophysiology and improves understanding of cytokine storm associated with coronavirus infections by comparing SARS-CoV-2 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)."
7997,Animal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2.,"COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has rapidly spread to 216 countries and territories since first outbreak in December of 2019, posing a substantial economic losses and extraordinary threats to the public health worldwide. Although bats have been suggested as the natural host of SARS-CoV-2, transmission chains of this virus, role of animals during cross-species transmission, and future concerns remain unclear. Diverse animal coronaviruses have extensively been studied since the discovery of avian coronavirus in 1930s. The current article comprehensively reviews and discusses the current understanding about animal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 for their emergence, transmission, zoonotic potential, alteration of tissue/host tropism, evolution, status of vaccines and surveillance. This study aims at providing guidance for control of COVID-19 and preventative strategies for possible future outbreaks of zoonotic coronavirus via cross-species transmission."
7998,Exploring the magic bullets to identify Achilles' heel in SARS-CoV-2: Delving deeper into the sea of possible therapeutic options in Covid-19 disease: An update.,"The symptoms associated with Covid-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in severe conditions can cause multiple organ failure and fatality via a plethora of mechanisms, and it is essential to discover the efficacious and safe drug. For this, a successful strategy is to inhibit in different stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and host cell reactions. The current review briefly put forth the summary of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and highlight the critical areas of understanding in genomics, proteomics, medicinal chemistry, and natural products derived drug discovery. The review further extends to briefly put forth the updates in the drug testing system, biologics, biophysics, and their advances concerning SARS-CoV-2. The salient features include information on SARS-CoV-2 morphology, genomic characterization, and pathophysiology along with important protein targets and how they influence the drug design and development against SARS-CoV-2 and a concerted and integrated approach to target these stages. The review also gives the status of drug design and discovery to identify the drugs acting on critical targets in SARS-CoV-2 and host reactions to treat Covid-19."
7999,Nanobiosensors for the Detection of Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and Other Pandemic/Epidemic Respiratory Viruses: A Review.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is considered a public health emergency of international concern. The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused this pandemic has spread rapidly to over 200 countries, and has drastically affected public health and the economies of states at unprecedented levels. In this context, efforts around the world are focusing on solving this problem in several directions of research, by: (i) exploring the origin and evolution of the phylogeny of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome; (ii) developing nanobiosensors that could be highly effective in detecting the new coronavirus; (iii) finding effective treatments for COVID-19; and (iv) working on vaccine development. In this paper, an overview of the progress made in the development of nanobiosensors for the detection of human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is presented, along with specific techniques for modifying the surface of nanobiosensors. The newest detection methods of the influenza virus responsible for acute respiratory syndrome were compared with conventional methods, highlighting the newest trends in diagnostics, applications, and challenges of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 causative virus) nanobiosensors."
