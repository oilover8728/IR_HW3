941,Imaging findings of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19.,"Background: A hyperinflammatory immune-mediated shock syndrome has been recognised in children exposed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To describe typical imaging findings in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19. Materials and methods: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, imaging studies and clinical data from children treated for multisystem inflammatory syndrome were collected from multiple centres. Standardised case templates including demographic, biochemical and imaging information were completed by participating centres and reviewed by paediatric radiologists and paediatricians. Results: We included 37 children (21 boys; median age 8.0 years). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 15/37 (41%) children and immunoglobulins in 13/19 children (68%). Common clinical presentations were fever (100%), abdominal pain (68%), rash (54%), conjunctivitis (38%) and cough (32%). Thirty-three children (89%) showed laboratory or imaging findings of cardiac involvement. Thirty of the 37 children (81%) required admission to the intensive care unit, with good recovery in all cases. Chest radiographs demonstrated cardiomegaly in 54% and signs of pulmonary venous hypertension/congestion in 73%. The most common chest CT abnormalities were ground-glass and interstitial opacities (83%), airspace consolidation (58%), pleural effusion (58%) and bronchial wall thickening (42%). Echocardiography revealed impaired cardiac function in half of cases (51%) and coronary artery abnormalities in 14%. Cardiac MRI showed myocardial oedema in 58%, pericardial effusion in 42% and decreased left ventricular function in 25%. Twenty children required imaging for abdominal symptoms, the commonest abnormalities being free fluid (71%) and terminal ileum wall thickening (57%). Twelve children underwent brain imaging, showing abnormalities in two cases. Conclusion: Children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome showed pulmonary, cardiac, abdominal and brain imaging findings, reflecting the multisystem inflammatory disease. Awareness of the imaging features of this disease is important for early diagnosis and treatment."
942,Low-dose and oral exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may help us understand and prevent severe COVID-19.,"Background: The effectiveness and sustainability of current public health interventions designed to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission remain of great concern in many settings, especially in the absence of a transmission-preventing vaccine. Hypothesis: It was hypothesized that a more targeted set of interventions focusing on preventing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), rather than SARS-CoV-2 transmission, would be less disruptive to society. To identify these, it would be helpful to better understand how the infecting dose of SARS-CoV-2 and its route of infection influence the clinical outcome, immunological protection, and likelihood of onward transmission. Proposal: It is suggested that carefully controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies involving intranasal and oral administration of progressively increasing doses of SARS-CoV-2, starting with low levels, to healthy young adult volunteers may be the most expeditious and definitive way to answer these questions. Such studies would differ in objective from CHIM proposals designed to expedite vaccine development, although the latter might be adapted to address some of the questions raised here. Implications: Results from the studies proposed here could help elucidate the relationship of infection to COVID-19 and thereby provide a scientific basis for more targeted and sustainable application of public health control measures, and inform the design of improved immunotherapeutics and more targeted vaccine development."
943,A systematic review of asymptomatic infections with COVID-19.,"Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late December 2019, it has brought significant harm and challenges to over 200 countries and regions around the world. However, there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, but they are able to transmit the virus to others. There are difficulties in screening for asymptomatic infections, which makes it more difficult for national prevention and control of this epidemic. This article reviews the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of asymptomatic infections with COVID-19, hoping it would be helpful for early prevention and control of this severe public health threat worldwide."
944,"Novel Coronavirus-2019 (2019-nCoV): Perspectives of emergence, prophylaxis and predicted treatment approaches.","Emergence of novel coronavirus-2019 has become an international health concern. The objective of this review is to focus on 2019-nCoV emergence, prophylaxis and to predict the treatment approaches. The first case of 2019-nCoV was noted in Wuhan, China. The WHO has announced this epidemic as pandemic. The 2019-nCoV has +ve ssRNA (29903bp), lipid-bilayer envelope spiked with glycoprotein and bears genome sequences similar to bat coronavirus RaTG13. Antiviral agents like Interferon, Darunavir, Ribavirin, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Camostat mesylate may be considered for clinical trials. Chinese herbals may be effective against 2019-nCoV. These include Saikosaponins (triterpene glycosides), Amentoflavone, Scutellarein, Myricetin, extracts of Isatis indigotica, and Houttuynia cordata. Another treatment approach is to administer plasma from COVID-19 recovered patients. RNA vaccines, recombinant vector based vaccine and ACE-2 receptor like molecules may be employed for immunization against COVID-19. Moreover, immunity can be boosted against 2019-nCoV by regular exercise. We have checked Thymoquinone as ligand for various targets of 2019-nCoV (receptor binding domain of spike, RNA polymerase, protease, Nsp9 RNA binding protein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, endoribonuclease) by protein-ligand docking server SwissDoc. Thymoquinone can bind effectively to the targets of 2019-nCoV. Hence, it may be an effective candidate for the treatment of COVID-19."
945,Performance evaluation of three automated quantitative immunoassays and their correlation with a surrogate virus neutralization test in coronavirus disease 19 patients and pre-pandemic controls.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is currently ongoing, meanwhile vaccinations are rapidly underway in some countries. The quantitative immunoassays detecting antibodies against spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 have been developed based on the findings that they have a better correlation with the neutralizing antibody. Methods: The performances of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG, and Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S were evaluated on 173 sera from 126 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 151 pre-pandemic sera. Their correlations with GenScript cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit were also analyzed on 173 sera from 126 SARS-CoV-2 patients. Results: Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant and Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S showed the highest overall sensitivity (96.0%), followed by LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG (93.6%). The specificities of Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG were 100.0%, followed by Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (99.3%). Regarding the correlation with cPass neutralization antibody assay, LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG showed the best correlation (Spearman rho = 0.88), followed by Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant and Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (all rho = 0.87). Conclusions: The three automated quantitative immunoassays showed good diagnostic performance and strong correlations with neutralization antibodies. These assays will be useful in diagnostic assistance, evaluating the response to vaccination, and the assessment of herd immunity in the future."

947,Virus detection via programmable Type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems.,"Among the currently available virus detection assays, those based on the programmable CRISPR-Cas enzymes have the advantage of rapid reporting and high sensitivity without the requirement of thermocyclers. Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system is a multi-component and multipronged immune effector, activated by viral RNA that previously has not been repurposed for disease detection owing in part to the complex enzyme reconstitution process and functionality. Here, we describe the construction and application of a virus detection method, based on an in vivo-reconstituted Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system. This system harnesses both RNA- and transcription-activated dual nucleic acid cleavage activities as well as internal signal amplification that allow virus detection with high sensitivity and at multiple settings. We demonstrate the use of the Type III-A system-based method in detection of SARS-CoV-2 that reached 2000 copies/μl sensitivity in amplification-free and 60 copies/μl sensitivity via isothermal amplification within 30 min and diagnosed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in both settings. The high sensitivity, flexible reaction conditions, and the small molecular-driven amplification make the Type III-A system a potentially unique nucleic acid detection method with broad applications."
948,Engineering luminescent biosensors for point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.,"Current serology tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies mainly take the form of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays or lateral flow assays, which are either laborious, expensive or lacking sufficient sensitivity and scalability. Here we present the development and validation of a rapid, low-cost, solution-based assay to detect antibodies in serum, plasma, whole blood and to a lesser extent saliva, using rationally designed split luciferase antibody biosensors. This new assay, which generates quantitative results in 30 min, substantially reduces the complexity and improves the scalability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibody tests. This assay is well-suited for point-of-care, broad population testing, and applications in low-resource settings, for monitoring host humoral responses to vaccination or viral infection."
949,"Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, replicating or non-replicating, using RT-PCR.","To identify animals susceptible to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 contaminated meat is from a SARS-CoV-2-infected animal, a convenient and safe method was developed for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a replicating or non-replicating status in samples using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This strategy can also be applied to develop assays for the detection of other viruses, either replicating or not."
