7550,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children and Their Parents in Southwest Germany.,"Importance: School and daycare closures were enforced as measures to confine the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, based on the assumption that young children may play a key role in severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread. Given the grave consequences of contact restrictions for children, a better understanding of their contribution to the COVID-19 pandemic is of great importance. Objective: To describe the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children aged 1 to 10 years, compared with a corresponding parent of each child, in a population-based sample. Design, setting, and participants: This large-scale, multicenter, cross-sectional investigation (the COVID-19 BaWü study) enrolled children aged 1 to 10 years and a corresponding parent between April 22 and May 15, 2020, in southwest Germany. Exposures: Potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Main outcomes and measures: The main outcomes were infection and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunofluorescence tests. Discordant results were clarified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, a second enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or an in-house Luminex-based assay. Results: This study included 4964 participants: 2482 children (median age, 6 [range, 1-10] years; 1265 boys [51.0%]) and 2482 parents (median age, 40 [range, 23-66] years; 615 men [24.8%]). Two participants (0.04%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was low in parents (1.8% [95% CI, 1.2-2.4%]) and 3-fold lower in children (0.6% [95% CI, 0.3-1.0%]). Among 56 families with at least 1 child or parent with seropositivity, the combination of a parent with seropositivity and a corresponding child with seronegativity was 4.3 (95% CI, 1.19-15.52) times higher than the combination of a parent who was seronegative and a corresponding child with seropositivity. We observed virus-neutralizing activity for 66 of 70 IgG-positive serum samples (94.3%). Conclusions and relevance: In this cross-sectional study, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a period of lockdown in southwest Germany was particularly low in children aged 1 to 10 years. Accordingly, it is unlikely that children have boosted the pandemic. This SARS-CoV-2 prevalence study, which appears to be the largest focusing on children, is instructive for how ad hoc mass testing provides the basis for rational political decision-making in a pandemic."
7551,COVID-19 diagnosis and management: a comprehensive review.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a novel coronavirus from the same family as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has spread worldwide leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals. Here, we provide an overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19. We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'. We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues. Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy. In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality."
7552,Comprehensive Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in a Public Health Virology Laboratory.,"SARS-CoV-2 has become a major global concern as of December 2019, particularly affecting healthcare workers. As person-to-person transmission is airborne, crowded closed spaces have high potential for rapid virus spread, especially early in the pandemic when social distancing and mask wearing were not mandatory. This retrospective study thoroughly investigates a small-scale SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Israel's central virology laboratory (ICVL) in mid-March 2020, in which six staff members and two related family members were infected. Suspicions regarding infection by contaminated surfaces in ICVL facilities were nullified by SARS-CoV-2 negative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of work surfaces swipe tests. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced and mutation analyses showed inclusion of all samples to clades 20B and 20C, possessing the spike mutation D614G. Phylogenetic analysis clarified transmission events, confirming S1 as having infected at least three other staff members and refuting the association of a staff member's infected spouse with the ICVL transmission cluster. Finally, serology tests exhibited IgG and IgA antibodies in all infected individuals and revealed the occurrence of asymptomatic infections in additional staff members. This study demonstrates the advantages of molecular epidemiology in elucidating transmission events and exemplifies the importance of good laboratory practice, distancing and mask wearing in preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread, specifically in healthcare facilities."
7553,[Evaluation of the effects of immunotherapy and mesenchymal stem cells transplantation in the treatment of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients].,"Objective: To analyze the immunotherapy and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and focus on exploring the effects of immunotherapy and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) transplantation in the critically ill patients' treatment. Methods: Fity-five COVID-19 patients were admitted to the Fifth People's Hospital of Wuxi from January 23rd to March 31st, 2020 as the research object. The demographic characteristics of the cases and the methods of immunotherapy were analyzed, focusing on the immunized indicators, positivity of pathogens and clinical indicators of critically ill COVID-19 patient, and the effects of immunotherapy and stem cell transplantation were evaluated. Results: Aged, male and people with comorbidities were the main risk factors in the development of severe and critical COVID-19. All of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n = 55) had been treated with interferon-α (IFN-α), of which 81.8% (n = 45, mild and ordinary) of the patients were recovered, 14.6% (n = 8) of the patients were converted to severe, 3.6% (n = 2) of the patients were converted to critical, and some severe patients were treated with gamma globulin and albumin as adjuvant treatment. Critically ill patients were not only treated with IFN-α, gamma globulin and albumin, but also treated with convalescent plasma and MSC transplantation. Due to pulmonary hemorrhage and persistently low blood oxygen saturation, terminal lung transplantation therapy was implemented. The total number of lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and B cells in peripheral blood of the two critical COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced, and the functions of lung, liver, and kidney were severely damaged on admission, manifested as significant increase of the levels of blood C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), etc. and decrease of blood oxygen saturation, and type I respiratory failure, and the noninvasive assisted ventilation was needed to improve. After adjuvant immunotherapy such as gamma globulin, the nucleic acid of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) turned into negative. The CRP of one critically ill patient was significantly lower than the value at admission (minimum of 21 mg/L). But the lung inflammation progressed rapidly, and the pathological results of the lung tissue from the lung transplantation showed hemorrhage and irreversible fibrosis. The ability to secrete immunoglobulin A (IgA) was significantly reduced. Liver function had been significantly improved and stabilized after treatment with convalescent plasma during the recovery period. MSC transplantation treatment reduced the BUN level by > 50% compared with the previous period, and the total number of lymphocytes in the patient increased by more than 2 times (rose from 0.23×109/L to 0.57×109/L), but the total amount of lymphocytes was still lower than the normal reference value (< 1.1×109/L). The lung inflammation lesions were obviously absorbed, and the vital signs were stable. Conclusions: In addition to IFN, gamma globulin, antiserum and MSC transplantation therapy can help clear the virus and reduce inflammation. Although MSC transplantation fail to completely change the immunecompromised state of critically ill patients, it controlled the progression of inflammation in the liver and kidneys."
7554,Understanding false positives and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and BD MAX SARS-CoV-2 assays.,"Several real-time RT-PCR assays have received Emergency Use Authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration. The BD MAX™ SARS-CoV-2 assay, run by the BD MAX™ system, is a qualitative test that detects the SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene regions, N1 and N2. The human RNase P gene is used as the endogenous nucleic acid extraction control. The Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, run by the GeneXpert system, detects the pan-sarbecovirus E gene and the N2 region of the N gene. We evaluated the performance characteristics of the BD and Cepheid assays using matched patient samples. We also analyzed comparative Ct values for both assays using 183 positive samples tested at this facility. In addition, we mitigated reporting false positive results without relying on interpretive software. We found that both systems showed comparable sensitivity. We found an approximately 3.5% false positive rate from the BD MAX™ system results."
7555,IFCC interim guidelines on rapid point-of-care antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.,"With an almost unremittent progression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections all around the world, there is a compelling need to introduce rapid, reliable, and high-throughput testing to allow appropriate clinical management and/or timely isolation of infected individuals. Although nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) remains the gold standard for detecting and theoretically quantifying SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in various specimen types, antigen assays may be considered a suitable alternative, under specific circumstances. Rapid antigen tests are meant to detect viral antigen proteins in biological specimens (e.g. nasal, nasopharyngeal, saliva), to indicate current SARS-CoV-2 infection. The available assay methodology includes rapid chromatographic immunoassays, used at the point-of-care, which carries some advantages and drawbacks compared to more conventional, instrumentation-based, laboratory immunoassays. Therefore, this document by the International Federation for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Taskforce on COVID-19 aims to summarize available data on the performance of currently available SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid detection tests (Ag-RDTs), providing interim guidance on clinical indications and target populations, assay selection, and evaluation, test interpretation and limitations, as well as on pre-analytical considerations. This document is hence mainly aimed to assist laboratory and regulated health professionals in selecting, validating, and implementing regulatory approved Ag-RDTs."
7556,COVID-19 in a state of Brazilian Northeast: Prevalence and associated factors in people with flu-like syndrome.,"Aims and objectives: To estimate the prevalence and associated factors of COVID-19 in people with flu-like syndrome in Ceará, Brazil. Background: COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has led to a worldwide public health emergency. More than 30,000 cases were confirmed in Brazil, especially in the States of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Ceará. The capital of the Ceará State is the one with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Brazil. Estimating the prevalence of the disease and its associated factors is important to offer adequate health care. Design: A cross-sectional study with secondary data of people notified with flu-like syndrome and COVID-19 test results. Methods: 19,967 cases of flu-like syndrome were analysed according to the result of the COVID-19 test. Predictive variables were as follows: age range, sex, women in puerperium, presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, haematological illness, immunodeficiencies, neurological diseases, obesity, renal diseases and Down syndrome. Robust Poisson regression models estimated the prevalence ratios of COVID-19. The research was reported via STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. Results: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the population was 10.37%. In the final model, the following variables were associated with COVID-19: aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Conclusion: Among the flu-like syndrome cases, COVID-19 prevalence was high. In the Ceará State, clinical factors such as aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes can enhance the prevalence of COVID-19 by up to 2.57 times. Relevance to clinical practice: The identification of factors that are associated with the enhanced prevalence of COVID-19 facilitates early diagnosis, and adequate and prompt treatment. This knowledge may avoid an unfavourable prognosis of the disease."
7557,Deposition distribution of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the human airways upon exposure to cough-generated droplets and aerosol particles.,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been emerged as a rapidly spreading pandemic. The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the acinar airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the acinar airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid to how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated droplets and aerosol particles. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Particle size distribution, breathing parameters supposing normal breathing through the nose, and viral loads were taken from the literature. We found that the probability of direct infection of the acinar airways due to inhalation of particles emitted by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of viruses deposited in the extrathoracic airways is about 7 times higher than in the acinar airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less dangerous. The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the acinar airways. Therefore, even non-specific treatment forms like disinfection of the throat and nasal and oral mucosa may effectively keep the viral load of the upper airways low enough to avoid or prolong the progression of the disease. In addition, using a tissue or cloth in order to absorb droplets and aerosol particles emitted by own coughs of infected patients before re-inhalation is highly recommended even if they are alone in quarantine."
7558,Comparison of Primer-Probe Sets among Different Master Mixes for Laboratory Screening of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"Background: There is a shortage of chemical reagents for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnosis and a surge of SARS-CoV-2 cases, especially in limited-resource settings. Therefore, the combination of an optimal assay kit is necessary. Methods: We compared the ability to screen SARS-CoV-2 among three primer-probe sets in two different master mixes, Invitrogen™ SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR and LightCycler Multiplex RNA Virus Master. Results: The assay with TIB-Molbiol, IDT, and Phu Sa sets for LightCycler Multiplex RNA Virus Master or Invitrogen™ SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR showed positive results from a single reaction of triplicate in the three days of 4.8 copies per reaction. R squared and amplification efficiency were 0.97 and ranged from 107 to 108%, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that TIB-Molbiol, IDT, and Phu Sa primer-probe sets could be beneficial for the laboratory screening of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR assay of E gene. There is a need to consider the combination of these reagent sets as a new strategy to increase the testing capacity of screening programs for COVID-19."
7559,Association between detectable SARS-COV-2 RNA in anal swabs and disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease 2019.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was found in the intestines and feces, but its clinical significance is not completely clear. We aim to characterize the longitudinal test results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs and to explore the association with disease severity. Methods: We included laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, who were hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital and excluded those who had not received anal swabs for SARS-COV-2 RNA testing. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained. Throat swabs and anal swabs were collected periodically for SARS-COV-2 RNA detection. Results: Two hundred and seventeen eligible patients (median aged 50 years, 50.2% were females) were analyzed. 21.2% (46/217) of the patients were detected with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs. The duration of viral RNA was longer, but the viral load was lower in anal swabs than throat swabs in the early stage of the disease. During a median follow-up of 20 days, 30 (13.8%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxemia. Detectable viral RNA in anal swabs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-5.24), increased C-reactive protein (aHR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.35-7.32) and lymphocytopenia (aHR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.46-6.67) were independently associated with ICU admission. The cumulative incidence of ICU admission was higher among patients with detectable viral RNA in anal swabs (26.3% vs 10.7%, P = .006). Conclusion: Detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the digestive tract was a potential warning indicator of severe disease."
