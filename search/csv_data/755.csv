7542,"Association of a High-Efficiency Particulate Air Filter COVID-19 Testing Booth With Testing Capacity, Cost Per Test Acquired, and Use of Personal Protective Equipment.","This quality improvement study compares COVID-19 testing throughput, personal protective equipment use, and cost per test before vs after the introduction of high-efficiency particulate air–filtered, positive-pressure Hexapod personal protection booths at a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts."
7543,[Case fatality rate of COVID-19: absence of epidemiological pattern].,"Objective: Analyze a set of indicators to understand the variability of the evolution and impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in a set of selected countries. Method: Ecological study of a group of countries with more than 200 reported cases. Demographic variables, health expenditure variables, and variables about characteristics of health services were included as explanatory variables. and incidence, mortality and fatality rates have been analyzed as response variables. In addition, a relative fatality index has been created. Data are from international organizations. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to estimate the magnitude of the associations. Results: Number of tests and of medical professionals are associated with a higher incidence rate. Mortality and case fatality rate are not associated with demographic, health expenditure, or health services variables. Conclusion: Differences suggest a general underestimation of the magnitude of the epidemic. Improvement of case identification and effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance systems is necessary."
7544,Longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 8000 U.S. first-time convalescent plasma donations.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent individuals carry antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that, through a plasma donation, can be used as a potential therapeutic either in direct transfusion or for the manufacture of hyperimmune globulin (HIG). The success of such interventions depends on the antibody potency in such plasma donations, but little information on the collection of potent units is currently available. Study design and methods: A total of 8749 plasma units, collected from April until September 2020 from first-time U.S. COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors, were characterized for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by Abbott chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). The period between COVID-19 onset until donation and donor age, ethnicity, sex, and COVID-19 severity were evaluated against the obtained signal (index S/C). Results: A marked decrease in mean index S/C was seen over the plasma collection period surveyed, which was significantly correlated to decreases in mean plasma donor age (p < .0001; R2 = .726) and percentage of donations obtained from COVID-19 convalescent patients who had been hospitalized (p = .001; R2 = .4426). The highest titer plasma units were obtained soon after convalescence from COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization, from advanced age donors, and from Black/African/Hispanic American versus White/Caucasian ethnicities, whereas there was no effect of donor sex on the values obtained with the Abbott CMIA. Conclusion: Since the onset of the pandemic, the average SARS-CoV-2 IgG values of first-time U.S. COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations have significantly dropped, mainly due to donations from progressively younger aged donors who tend to experience less severe COVID-19."
7545,"Positive results for patients with COVID-19 discharged form hospital in Chongqing, China.","Background: Since December 2019, over 80,000 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed in China. With the increasing number of recovered patients, more attention should be paid to the follow-up of these patients. Methods: In the study, 576 patients with COVID-19 discharged from hospital in Chongqing, China from January 24, 2020, to March 10, 2020 were evaluated by viral nucleic acid tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) to determine if they could be released from quarantine. Among the 576 patients, 61 patients (10.6%) had positive RT-PCR test results of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyze the demographics, clinical characteristics and treatment of 61 patients. Results: These positive patients were characterized by older age, chronic medical illness and mild conditions. 38 (62.3%) patients who were asymptomatic without abnormalities on chest radiographs were found in the positive with COVID-19. Also, they showed positive results of stool or sputum specimens with negative results of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The median duration of positive result of SARS-CoV-2 was varied from 3 days to 35 days in the patients discharged from hospital with no family member infection. Conclusions: Multi-site screening of SARS-CoV-2 including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, stool and sputum specimens could be considered to improve the diagnosis, treatment and infection control in patients with COVID-19. Our findings provide the important information and clinical evidence for the improved management of patients recovered from COVID-19."
7546,The impact of preoperative screening system on head and neck cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: Recommendations from the nationwide survey in Japan.,"Objective: the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hospitals worldwide are at risk of nosocomial infection. Preoperative identification of COVID-19 in patients who are scheduled to be admitted to the hospital is essential to preventing the collapse of medical facility. In Japan, the preoperative observation and screening tests with the RT-PCR testing for the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and chest CT scan are recommended for head and neck cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We conducted surveys of the current situation in Japan through the internet. Results: Chest CT scan was fully performed (90%), but the RT-PCR testing was not adequately performed (51%). Conclusion: Although the current screening system can be considered effective to a certain extent, we recommend further widespread use of pre-admission RT-PCR testing not only for patients with head and neck cancer surgery but also for all the hospitalized patients, in order to promote safer treatments, during the COVID-19 pandemic."
7547,Eosinopenia <100/muL as a marker of active COVID-19: An observational prospective study.,"Objectives: To analyse the diagnostic performance of eosinopenia, alone or combined with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and/or lymphocytes, as a marker of active COVID-19 in patients hospitalized for suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: A prospective observational study including patients hospitalized for suspicion of COVID-19 in a COVID unit was performed from 20th March to 5th April 2020, in Perpignan, France. Patients for which there was a doubt upon diagnosis, who were recently under oral corticosteroids, had myeloid malignancy or human immunodeficient virus infection were excluded. SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using an RT-PCR assay, from nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Complete blood count were performed for all patients. Results: One-hundred and twenty-one patient were included: 57 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 64 patients were not. Eosinophil count was lower in the COVID-19 group (median: 0/μL versus 70/μL, p < 0.0001). To diagnose COVID-19, eosinopenia had a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 78.1% while lymphopenia's were 73.7% and 62.5% respectively. Using area under curve (AUC) of receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curves, eosinophil's optimal cut-off level was 10/μL, sensitivity and specificity were 86%, and 79.7% respectively. Regarding the eosinophil/PMN ratio, the optimal cut-off level was 3.344, sensitivity and specificity were 87.7% and 73.4% respectively. The AUC of lymphocyte/PMN ratio was significantly lower than eosinophil/PMN ratio's (0.621 versus 0.846, p = 0.0003). Conclusion: Eosinopenia - <10/μL - and eosinophil/PMN ratio are useful, low-cost, reproducible tools to help diagnose COVID-19, during an epidemic period, in a population of hospitalized patients admitted for suspicion of COVID-19."
7548,A comprehensive analysis of the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines.,"The numbers of cases and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are continuously increasing. Many people are concerned about the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the published trials of COVID-19 vaccines and the real-world data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Globally, our research found that the efficacy of all vaccines exceeded 70%, and RNA-based vaccines had the highest efficacy of 94.29%; moreover, Black or African American people, young people, and males may experience greater vaccine efficacy. The spectrum of vaccine-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is extremely broad, and the most frequent ADRs are pain, fatigue, and headache. Most ADRs are tolerable and are mainly grade 1 or 2 in severity. Some severe ADRs have been identified (thromboembolic events, 21-75 cases per million doses; myocarditis/pericarditis, 2-3 cases per million doses). In summary, vaccines are a powerful tool that can be used to control the COVID-19 pandemic, with high efficacy and tolerable ADRs. In addition, the spectrum of ADRs associated with the vaccines is broad, and most of the reactions appear within a week, although some may be delayed. Therefore, ADRs after vaccination need to be identified and addressed in a timely manner."
7549,"United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH): a retrospective cohort study using linked routinely collected data, study protocol.","Introduction: COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, causing significant morbidity and mortality. People from ethnic minorities, particularly those working in healthcare settings, have been disproportionately affected. Current evidence of the association between ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes in people working in healthcare settings is insufficient to inform plans to address health inequalities. Methods and analysis: This study combines anonymised human resource databases with professional registration and National Health Service data sets to assess associations between ethnicity and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and death in healthcare workers in the UK. Adverse COVID-19 outcomes will be assessed between 1 February 2020 (date following first confirmed COVID-19 case in UK) and study end date (31 January 2021), allowing 1-year of follow-up. Planned analyses include multivariable Poisson, logistic and flexible parametric time-to-event regression within each country, adjusting for core predictors, followed by meta-analysis of country-specific results to produce combined effect estimates for the UK. Mediation analysis methods will be explored to examine the direct, indirect and mediated interactive effects between ethnicity, occupational group and COVID-19 outcomes. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval for the UK-REACH programme has been obtained via the expedited HRA COVID-19 processes (REC ref: 20/HRA/4718, IRAS ID: 288316). Research information will be anonymised via the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank before release to researchers. Study results will be submitted for publication in an open access peer-reviewed journal and made available on our dedicated website (https://uk-reach.org/). Trial registration number: ISRCTN11811602."
