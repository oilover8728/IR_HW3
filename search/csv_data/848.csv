8471,Public Perspectives on COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritization.,"Importance: As COVID-19 vaccine distribution continues, policy makers are struggling to decide which groups should be prioritized for vaccination. Objective: To assess US adults' preferences regarding COVID-19 vaccine prioritization. Design, setting, and participants: This survey study involved 2 independent, online surveys of US adults aged 18 years and older, 1 conducted by Gallup from September 14 to 27, 2020, and the other conducted by the COVID Collaborative from September 19 to 25, 2020. Samples were weighted to reflect sociodemographic characteristics of the US population. Exposures: Respondents were asked to prioritize groups for COVID-19 vaccine and to rank their prioritization considerations. Main outcomes and measures: The study assessed prioritization preferences and agreement with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's Preliminary Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine. Results: A total of 4735 individuals participated, 2730 (1474 men [54.1%]; mean [SD] age, 59.2 [14.5] years) in the Gallup survey and 2005 (944 men [47.1%]; 203 participants [21.5%] aged 55-59 years) in the COVID Collaborative survey. In both the Gallup COVID-19 Panel and COVID Collaborative surveys, respondents listed health care workers (Gallup, 93.6% [95% CI, 91.2%-95.3%]; COVID Collaborative, 80.0% [95% CI, 78.0%-81.9%]) and adults of any age with serious comorbid conditions (Gallup, 78.6% [95% CI, 75.2%-81.7%]; COVID Collaborative, 72.9% [95% CI, 70.7%-74.9%]) among their 4 highest priority groups. Respondents of all political affiliations agreed with prioritizing Black, Hispanic, Native American, and other communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (Gallup, 74.2% [95% CI, 70.6%-77.5%]; COVID Collaborative, 84.9% [95% CI, 83.1%-86.5%]), and COVID Collaborative respondents were willing to be preceded in line by teachers and childcare workers (92.5%; 95% CI, 91.2%-93.7%) and grocery workers (85.9%; 95% CI, 84.2%-87.5%). Older respondents in both surveys were significantly less likely than younger respondents to prioritize healthy adults aged 65 years and older among their 4 highest priority groups (Gallup, 23.7% vs 39.1% [χ2 = 2160.8; P < .001]; COVID Collaborative, 23.3% vs 28.8% [χ2 = 5.0198; P = .03]). COVID Collaborative respondents believed the 4 most important considerations for prioritization were preventing COVID-19 spread (78.4% [95% CI, 76.3%-80.3%]), preventing the most deaths (72.1% [95% CI, 69.9%-74.2%]), preventing long-term complications (68.9% [66.6%-71.9%]), and protecting frontline workers (63.8% [95% CI, 61.5%-66.1%]). Conclusions and relevance: US adults broadly agreed with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's prioritization framework. Respondents endorsed prioritizing racial/ethnic communities that are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and older respondents were significantly less likely than younger respondents to endorse prioritizing healthy people older than 65 years. This provides reason for caution about COVID-19 vaccine distribution plans that prioritize healthy adults older than a cutoff age without including those younger than that age with preexisting conditions, that aim solely to prevent the most deaths, or that give no priority to frontline workers or disproportionately affected communities."
8472,Strategies and Experiences of the Small Laboratory to Cope with the Mass Nucleic Acid Test of SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak, which began in late 2019, continues to ravage the globe and has become the greatest threat to human health. As nucleic acid test is the primary means of screening for COVID-19, this makes the laboratory the most important node in the epidemic prevention and control system. Methods: As a small laboratory in the hospital, we can meet a large number of demands for nucleic acid test by optimizing staff process, strictly disinfecting experimental batches and changing experimental methods. Results: Through the improvement of the above aspects, our daily maximum detection quantity has been increased from 256/day to 1,012/day. Besides, none of the medical staff has been infected. And there have been no nosocomial infections. Conclusions: Nucleic acid laboratories, especially small laboratories, should promptly adjust their strategies in the face of unexpected outbreaks and conduct risk assessment in accordance with laboratory activities."
8473,A novel STING agonist for cancer immunotherapy and a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine adjuvant.,"A novel STING agonist, CDGSF, ipsilaterally modified with phosphorothioate and fluorine, was synthesized. The phosphorothioate in CDGSF might be a site for covalent conjugation. Injection of CDGSF generated an immunogenic (""hot"") tumor microenvironment to suppress melanoma, more efficiently than dithio CDG. In particular, immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using CDGSF as an adjuvant elicited an exceptionally high antibody titer and a robust T cell response, overcoming the drawbacks of aluminum hydroxide. These results highlighted the therapeutic potential of CDGSF for cancer immunotherapy and the adjuvant potential of the STING agonist in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for the first time."
8474,Race to arsenal COVID-19 therapeutics: Current alarming status and future directions.,"The on-going pandemic of COVID-19 wreaked by a viral infection of SARS-CoV-2, has generated a catastrophic plight across the globe. Interestingly, one of the hallmarks of COVID-19 is the so-called 'cytokine storm' due to attack of SARS-Cov-2 in the lungs. Considering, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy could contribute against SARS-CoV-2 viruses attack because of their immune modulatory and anti-inflammatory ability linked to their stemness, to the arsenal of treatments for COVID-19. Another novel therapeutic strategies include the blockade of rampant generation of pro-inflammatory mediators like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), degradation of viral protein capsids by PROTACs, composed of Ubiquitin-proteasome framework, and ubiquitination-independent pathway directing the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (nCoV N) and proteasome activator (PA28γ), etc. This review is consequently an endeavour to highlight the several aspects of COVID-19 with incorporation of important treatment strategies discovered to date and putting the real effort on the future directions to put them into the perspective."
8475,High-throughput wastewater analysis for substance use assessment in central New York during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Wastewater entering sewer networks represents a unique source of pooled epidemiological information. In this study, we coupled online solid-phase extraction with liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry to achieve high-throughput analysis of health and lifestyle-related substances in untreated municipal wastewater during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Twenty-six substances were identified and quantified in influent samples collected from six wastewater treatment plants during the COVID-19 pandemic in central New York. Over a 12 week sampling period, the mean summed consumption rate of six major substance groups (i.e., antidepressants, antiepileptics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, synthetic opioids, and central nervous system stimulants) correlated with disparities in household income, marital status, and age of the contributing populations as well as the detection frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater and the COVID-19 test positivity in the studied sewersheds. Nontarget screening revealed the covariation of piperine, a nontarget substance, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater collected from one of the sewersheds. Overall, this proof-of-the-concept study demonstrated the utility of high-throughput wastewater analysis for assessing the population-level substance use patterns during a public health crisis such as COVID-19."
8476,"Performing the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab for 2019-novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) safely: How to dress, undress, and technical notes.","Background: To show how to safely perform nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs for 2019-novel coronavirus. Methods: The video describes in detail the dressing and undressing procedures of health personnel, with the appropriate personal protective equipment. Technical notes for the execution of the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab are also provided to avoid sampling errors. Results: The undressing phase is the procedure with the highest risk of self-contamination for the health worker. Following the various steps as shown in the video, there were no cases of contagion among the otolaryngology team appointed to perform the swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of safely performing nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs for identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA."
8477,Mutation-Specific SARS-CoV-2 PCR Screen: Rapid and Accurate Detection of Variants of Concern and the Identification of a Newly Emerging Variant with Spike L452R Mutation.,"The emergence of more transmissible and/or more virulent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOC) has triggered intensive genomic surveillance, which is costly and difficult to sustain operationally over the long term. To address this problem, we developed a set of four multiplex mutation-specific PCR-based assays with same-day reporting that can detect five VOC and three variants of interest (VOI), as defined in the March 2021 guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/). The screening results were compared to the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and showed 100% concordance for strain typing for B.1.1.7 (n = 25) and P.1 (n = 5) variants using spike (S) mutation S-N501Y, S-E484K, and S-H69-V70del assays. The S-L450R assay, designed to detect the B.1.427/429 VOC, also identified multiple isolates of a newly emerging multiply mutated B.1.526.1 variant that is now rapidly increasing in the eastern United States. PCR approaches can be easily adopted in clinical laboratories, providing rapid screening methods to allow early detection of newly emergent variants and to efficiently triage cases for full genomic sequencing."
