1320,New vaccine production platforms used in developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.,"The threat of the current coronavirus disease pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is accelerating the development of potential vaccines. Candidate vaccines have been generated using existing technologies that have been applied for developing vaccines against other infectious diseases. Two new types of platforms, mRNA- and viral vector-based vaccines, have been gaining attention owing to the rapid advancement in their methodologies. In clinical trials, setting appropriate immunological endpoints plays a key role in evaluating the efficacy and safety of candidate vaccines. Updated information about immunological features from individuals who have or have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 continues to guide effective vaccine development strategies. This review highlights key strategies for generating candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and considerations for vaccine development and clinical trials."

1322,Use of the variplex SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP as a rapid molecular assay to complement RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Background: Molecular assays based on reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) may be useful for rapid diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of the easy performance and the option to bypass RNA extraction. Objectives: This study was designed to evaluate the clinical performance of the CE-labeled variplexTM real time SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay in comparison to commercial RT-PCRs. Study design: RNA extracted from pharyngeal swabs was tested by variplex™ RT-LAMP and Corman's LightMix™ E gene RT-PCR as reference. Samples of respiratory secretions from Coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) and negative control patients were analyzed by variplex™ without RNA extraction and tested in parallel with the Allplex™ and VIASURE BD MAX RT-PCRs. Results: Using isolated RNA variplex™ RT-LAMP showed a sensitivity of 75 % compared to LightMix E gene RT-PCR but contrary to the latter it produced no false-positive results. For the evaluation of samples from respiratory secretions concordance analysis showed only a moderate agreement between the variplex™ RT-LAMP conducted on unprocessed samples and Allplex™ and VIASURE RT-PCRs (Cohen's κ ranging from 0.52-0.56). Using the approach to define a sample as true-positive when at least two assays gave a positive result the clinical sensitivities were as follows: 76.3 % for variplex™, 84.2 % for Allplex™ and 68.4 % for VIASURE. However, when results of RT-PCR and RT-LAMP were combined diagnostic sensitivity was increased to 92-100 %. Conclusion: The variplex RT-LAMP may serve as a rapid test to be combined with a RT-PCR assay to increase the diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected COVID-19 infection."
1323,"Development of a Novel, Genome Subtraction-Derived, SARS-CoV-2-Specific COVID-19-nsp2 Real-Time RT-PCR Assay and Its Evaluation Using Clinical Specimens.","The pandemic novel coronavirus infection, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has affected at least 190 countries or territories, with 465,915 confirmed cases and 21,031 deaths. In a containment-based strategy, rapid, sensitive and specific testing is important in epidemiological control and clinical management. Using 96 SARS-CoV-2 and 104 non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genomes and our in-house program, GolayMetaMiner, four specific regions longer than 50 nucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were identified. Primers were designed to target the longest and previously untargeted nsp2 region and optimized as a probe-free real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The new COVID-19-nsp2 assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.8 TCID50/mL and did not amplify other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses. Assay reproducibility in terms of cycle threshold (Cp) values was satisfactory, with the total imprecision (% CV) values well below 5%. Evaluation of the new assay using 59 clinical specimens from 14 confirmed cases showed 100% concordance with our previously developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel reference assay. A rapid, sensitive, SARS-CoV-2-specific real-time RT-PCR assay, COVID-19-nsp2, was developed."

1325,Super-rapid race for saving lives by developing COVID-19 vaccines.,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people and claimed thousands of lives. Starting in China, it is arguably the most precipitous global health calamity of modern times. The entire world has rocked back to fight against the disease and the COVID-19 vaccine is the prime weapon. Even though the conventional vaccine development pipeline usually takes more than a decade, the escalating daily death rates due to COVID-19 infections have resulted in the development of fast-track strategies to bring in the vaccine under a year's time. Governments, companies, and universities have networked to pool resources and have come up with a number of vaccine candidates. Also, international consortia have emerged to address the distribution of successful candidates. Herein, we summarize these unprecedented developments in vaccine science and discuss the types of COVID-19 vaccines, their developmental strategies, and their roles as well as their limitations."
1326,Early approval of COVID-19 vaccines: Pros and cons.,"The development of safe and effective vaccines has been an overriding priority for controlling the 2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. From the onset, COVID-19 has caused high mortality and economic losses and yet has also offered an opportunity to advance novel therapeutics such as DNA and mRNA vaccines. Although it is hoped that the swift acceptance of such vaccines will prevent loss of life, rejuvenate economies and restore normal life, there could also be significant pitfalls. This perspective provides an overview of future directions and challenges in advancing promising vaccine platforms to widespread therapeutic use."
1327,"Challenges of SARS-CoV-2 prevention in flights, suggested solutions with potential on-site diagnosis resembling cancer biomarkers and urgency of travel medicine.","Objective: The current pandemic makes the international flights facing multiple challenges including infection during flights. Here the objective is to analyze the infection trend of flights from a regional data set and discuss the solutions for diagnosis and travel medicine. Materials and methods: The public data was applied for trend analysis and new solutions were provided based on the current diagnosis information and resembling cancer diagnosis. Results: Flights infection has decreased since the large-scale cease of flights. Challenges of prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in flights exist due to testing accuracy, asymptomatic and many other factors including people gathering. To avoid the pandemic worsen, the solutions are provided for new coming flight resumes. Hotel, mandatory PPE, airport diagnosis, rapid imaging/biomarker diagnosis by advanced high-technology and emergency-travel medicine department are suggested as solutions. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 prevention in flights needs multiple solutions by potential on-site diagnosis and urgent establishment of a travel medicine unit at airport."
1328,The Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay enables high ratio pooling saving reagents and improving turnaround time.,"Background: The Hologic Aptima™ TMA SARS-CoV-2 assay was employed to test pooled nasopharyngeal (NP) samples to evaluate the performance of pooled sample testing and characterize variables influencing results. Methods: Results on 1033 previously tested NP samples were retrieved to characterize the relative light units (RLU) of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples in the tested population. The pooling strategy of combining 10 SARS-CoV-2 samples into one pool (10/1) was used in this study. The results were compared with neat sample testing using the same Aptima™ TMA SARS-CoV-2 assay and also the CDC RT-PCR and the Cepheid SARS-CoV-2 assays. Results: The Aptima assay compares favorably with both CDC RT-PCR and the Cepheid SARS-CoV-2 assays. Once samples are pooled 10 to 1 as in our experiments, the resulting signal strength of the assay suffers. A divide opens between pools assembled from strong-positive versus only weak-positive samples. Pools of the former can be reliably detected with positive percent agreement (PPA) of 95.2%, while pools of the latter are frequently misclassified as negative with PPA of 40%. When the weak-positive samples with kRLU value lower than 1012 constitute 3.4% of the total sample profile, the assay PPA approaches 93.4% suggesting that 10/1 pooled sample testing by the Aptima assay is an effective screening tool for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Performing pooled testing, one should monitor the weak positives with kRLU lower than 1012 or quantification cycle (Cq) value higher than 35 on an ongoing basis and adjust pooling approaches to avoid reporting false negatives."
1329,Emerging treatment strategies for COVID-19 infection.,"The new type of coronavirus (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2 originated from Wuhan, China and has led to a worldwide pandemic. COVID-19 is a novel emerging infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 characterized as atypical pneumonia. As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, sore throat, fatigue, cough, and dyspnoea combined with recent exposure. Most of the patients with COVID-19 have mild or moderate disease, however up to 5-10% present with severe and even life-threatening disease course. The mortality rates are approximately 2%. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective and specific antiviral treatment. Currently, supportive care measures such as ventilation oxygenation and fluid management remain the standard of care. Several clinical trials are currently trying to identify the most potent drug or combination against the disease, and it is strongly recommended to enroll patients into ongoing trials. Antivirals can be proven as safe and effective only in the context of randomized clinical trials. Currently several agents such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, monoclonal antibodies, antisense RNA, corticosteroids, convalescent plasma and vaccines are being evaluated. The large numbers of therapeutic interventions aim to define the most efficacious regimen. The aim of this article is to describe the treatment strategies that have been used for COVID-19 patients and review all the available literature."
