3361,Improved diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by using nucleoprotein and spike protein fragment 2 in quantitative dual ELISA tests.,"The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the causative agent of the 2020 worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Antibody testing is useful for diagnosing historic infections of a disease in a population. These tests are also a helpful epidemiological tool for predicting how the virus spreads in a community, relating antibody levels to immunity and for assessing herd immunity. In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were recombinantly produced and used to analyse serum from individuals previously exposed, or not, to SARS-CoV-2. The nucleocapsid (Npro) and spike subunit 2 (S2Frag) proteins were identified as highly immunogenic, although responses to the former were generally greater. These two proteins were used to develop two quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that when used in combination resulted in a highly reliable diagnostic test. Npro and S2Frag-ELISAs could detect at least 10% more true positive coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases than the commercially available ARCHITECT test (Abbott). Moreover, our quantitative ELISAs also show that specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins tend to wane rapidly even in patients who had developed severe disease. As antibody tests complement COVID-19 diagnosis and determine population-level surveillance during this pandemic, the alternative diagnostic we present in this study could play a role in controlling the spread of the virus."
3362,CRISPR-Cas12-based detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"An outbreak of betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 began in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID-19, the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, rapidly spread to produce a global pandemic. We report development of a rapid (<40 min), easy-to-implement and accurate CRISPR-Cas12-based lateral flow assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory swab RNA extracts. We validated our method using contrived reference samples and clinical samples from patients in the United States, including 36 patients with COVID-19 infection and 42 patients with other viral respiratory infections. Our CRISPR-based DETECTR assay provides a visual and faster alternative to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR assay, with 95% positive predictive agreement and 100% negative predictive agreement."
3363,Neutralizing and cross-reacting antibodies: implications for immunotherapy and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in 2019 and quickly spread globally, causing a pandemic. There is an urgent need to develop vaccines against the virus, and both convalescent plasma and immune globulin are currently in clinical trials for treatment of patients with COVID-19. It is unclear whether antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 have neutralizing capacity and whether they can protect from future infection. Seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been circulating for decades. It is currently unknown whether antibodies against seasonal HCoV may cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Data from neonates suggest that trans-placental antibodies against HCoV may have neutralizing capacity. Here we briefly review the epidemiologic observations on HCoV and discuss the potential implications for neutralizing and cross-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2."

3365,COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy and Lactation: Current Research and Gaps in Understanding.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the urgent need to develop vaccine strategies optimized for pregnant people and their newborns, as both populations are at risk of developing severe disease. Although not included in COVID-19 vaccine development trials, pregnant people have had access to these vaccines since their initial release in the US and abroad. The rapid development and distribution of novel COVID-19 vaccines to people at risk, including those who are pregnant and lactating, presents an unprecedented opportunity to further our understanding of vaccine-induced immunity in these populations. In this review, we aim to summarize the literature to date on COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy and lactation and highlight opportunities for investigation that may inform future maternal vaccine development and implementation strategies."

3367,Exploring the therapeutic potential of marine-derived bioactive compounds against COVID-19.,"The ocean is the most biodiverse habitat of various organisms. The organisms surviving in the harsh conditions of the ocean consist of several spectacular properties and produce bioactive compounds of pharmacological importance. These compounds are effective even in small quantities with various immunomodulatory qualities such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Though the vaccines for COVID-19 are developed, and drug development is also in progress, but till now no effective drug is available for this deadly virus. Researchers are mining the huge data of bioactive compounds to develop the specific drug for COVID-19. The use of the repurposed drugs is challenging against the rapidly mutating virus with variable symptoms and mode of transmission. This review is an attempt to compile all the spattered data of marine-derived bioactive compounds with antiviral properties and to explore their therapeutic potential against COVID-19."
