1590,Comparison of 12 Molecular Detection Assays for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"Molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the mainstay for accurate diagnosis of the infection, but the diagnostic performances of available assays have not been defined. We compared 12 molecular diagnostic assays, including 8 commercial kits using 155 respiratory samples (65 nasopharyngeal swabs, 45 oropharyngeal swabs, and 45 sputum) collected at two Japanese hospitals. Sixty-eight samples were positive for more than one assay and one genetic locus, and were defined as true-positive samples. All the assays showed a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 95.8%-100%). The N2 assay kit of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the N2 assay of the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) were the most sensitive assays with 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 94.7-100), followed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention N1 kit, E assay by Corman, and Japanese National Institute of Infectious Disease N2 assay multiplex with internal control reactions. These assays are reliable as first-line molecular assays in laboratories when combined with appropriate internal control reactions."
1591,Performance Evaluation of the MatMaCorp COVID-19 2SF Assay for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Nasopharyngeal Swabs.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll on clinical diagnostic testing, and the need for PCR-based testing remains to be met. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the recommended method for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to the inherent advantages in sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the MatMaCorp COVID-19 2SF test, a reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, run on the Solas 8 instrument (MatMaCorp, Lincoln, NE). The Solas 8 device is portable, and the kit is a lab-in-a-box design which provides reagents in a shelf-stable lyophilized powder format. A total of 78 remnant clinical specimens were used to evaluate the COVID-19 2SF test. Sixty-two clinical specimens originally tested by the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay (Cepheid, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) were used to evaluate the clinical accuracy of the COVID-19 2SF test. The negative percent agreement (NPA) was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.9% to 100%), and the positive percent agreement (PPA) was 85.4% (95% CI, 70.8% to 94.4%). Sixteen remnant specimens positive for other common respiratory pathogens (FilmArray respiratory panel 2.0; BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT) were assayed on the Solas 8 device to evaluate specificity. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens was identified. The unique lab-in-a-box design and shelf-stable reagents of the MatMaCorp COVID-19 2SF test offer laboratories a rapid option for a diagnostic NAAT for SARS-CoV-2 that can help meet diagnostic needs. IMPORTANCE The demand for molecular testing for COVID-19 remains to be met. This study of the MatMaCorp Solas 8 device and COVID-19 test provides the first evaluation of this platform."

1593,Improving the Outcomes of Immunocompromised Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"Recent case studies have highlighted the fact that certain immunocompromised individuals are at risk for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 replication, intrahost viral evolution of multiply-mutated variants, and poor clinical outcomes. The immunologic determinants of this risk, the duration of infectiousness, and optimal treatment and prevention strategies in immunocompromised hosts are ill defined. Of additional concern is the widespread use of immunosuppressive medications to treat COVID-19, which may enhance and prolong viral replication in the context of immunodeficiency. We outline the rationale for 4 interrelated approaches to usher in an era of evidence-based medicine for optimal management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19: multicenter pathogenesis and outcomes studies to relate the risk of severe disease to the type and degree of immunodeficiency, studies to evaluate immunologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, studies to evaluate the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies for primary prophylaxis, and clinical trials of novel antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19."
1594,Experimental studies using OMV in a new platform of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.,"Although COVID-19 vaccines have recently been approved for emergency use, search for new vaccines are still urgent, since the access of the countries, especially the poorest, to the vaccines, has shown to be slower than the necessary to rapidly control the pandemic. We proposed a novel platform for vaccine using recombinant receptor binding domain (rRBD) from Sars-Cov-2 spike protein and Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The antigen preparation produced a humoral and cellular immune response. Taken together our findings suggest a good immunostimulatory patter in response to immunization with rRBD plus N. meningitidis OMV."

1597,Can quantitative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 help in better management of patients and control of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), represents a public health emergency of unprecedented proportion. The global containment efforts have been focused on testing, tracing of contacts and treatment (isolation) of those found COVID-19 positive. Since the whole genome sequences of a number of strains of this novel RNA virus were available in the public domain by early January 2020, a number of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols were designed and used for diagnosis of this infection. Most RT-PCRs are designed for qualitative COVID-19 reporting (SARS-CoV-2 detected or not detected), but have been used for semi-quantitative estimation of viral load based on cycle threshold value. Our manuscript discusses the utility of quantitative PCR testing for COVID-19 and its patient management benefits."
1598,"A multidisciplinary evaluation of suspected, non-confirmed cases of COVID-19 including chest CT, as compared to World Health Organization recommendations.","Aim: To report an audit of the evaluation of suspected, unconfirmed cases of COVID-19 including chest computed tomography (CT), as compared to World Health Organization recommendations. Methods: A clinical audit was undertaken examining the evaluation of patients with suspected COVID-19 with negative SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, with comparison to WHO recommendations. A retrospective chart review was undertaken for 90 patients examining investigations, in particular CT, used to clarify the diagnosis. Results: Ninety patients underwent additional investigation. Seventy-five per cent adherence to WHO recommendations was observed. Fifty-two men (57.78%) and 38 (42.22%) women were investigated, with a median age of 69 years (range 20-96 years). Seventy-nine chest CT examinations demonstrated positive, indeterminate, and negative rates for COVID-19 of 3.79%, 24.1%, and 72.15% respectively. Three patients had discordant swab results with initially negative and subsequently positive results for SARS-CoV-2, resulting in false-negative rates of 5.1% for those retested. Combining discordant RT-PCR swab results, positive radiology, and patients treated as COVID-19-positive due to indeterminate radiology and highly consistent symptoms, resulted in a false-negative rate for initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swabs of 16.67%. Conclusion: Seventy-five per cent compliance with relevant WHO guidance and a false-negative rate for initial swabs of 16.67% was demonstrated. Further evidence is needed to fully determine the utility of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the context of initial false-negative RT-PCR results."
