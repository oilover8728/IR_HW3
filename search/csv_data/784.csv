7830,"Durable Antibody Responses in Staff at Two Long-Term Care Facilities, during and Post SARS-CoV-2 Outbreaks.","SARS-CoV-2 has had a disproportionate impact on nonhospital health care settings, such as long-term-care facilities (LTCFs). The communal nature of these facilities, paired with the high-risk profile of residents, has resulted in thousands of infections and deaths and a high case fatality rate. To detect presymptomatic infections and identify infected workers, we performed weekly surveillance testing of staff at two LTCFs, which revealed a large outbreak at one of the sites. We collected serum from staff members throughout the study and evaluated it for binding and neutralization to measure seroprevalence, seroconversion, and type and functionality of antibodies. At the site with very few incident infections, we detected that over 40% of the staff had preexisting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, suggesting prior exposure. At the outbreak site, we saw rapid seroconversion following infection. Neutralizing antibody levels were stable for many weeks following infection, suggesting a durable, long-lived response. Receptor-binding domain antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were strongly correlated. The site with high seroprevalence among staff had two unique introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility through seronegative infected staff during the period of study, but these did not result in workplace spread or outbreaks. Together, our results suggest that a high seroprevalence rate among staff can contribute to immunity within a workplace and protect against subsequent infection and spread within a facility. IMPORTANCE Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 due to their communal nature and high-risk profile of residents. LTCF staff have the ability to introduce SARS-CoV-2 into the facility, where it can spread, causing outbreaks. We tested staff weekly at two LTCFs and collected blood throughout the study to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. One site had a large outbreak and infected individuals rapidly generated antibodies after infection. At the other site, almost half the staff already had antibodies, suggesting prior infection. The majority of these antibodies bind to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and are potently neutralizing and stable for many months. The non-outbreak site had two unique introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility, but these did not result in workplace spread or outbreaks. Our results reveal that high seroprevalence among staff can contribute to immunity and protect against subsequent infection and spread within a facility."
7831,Successful treatment of a centenarian with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using convalescent plasma.,"Background: Because treatment options for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are very limited, the use of convalescent plasma has bee explored. Case presentation and treatment: A male centenarian with cough and dyspnea for 2 months was diagnosed with COVID-19. Without effective treatments and with the increased risks of antiviral therapy for the elderly, this patient was given convalescent plasma. The viral load, complete blood count, inflammatory indicators, vital signs, and clinical symptoms were observed before and after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: After convalescent plasma transfusion, significant improvement was observed on laboratory indicators and clinical symptoms of the patient. Concurrently, SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreased sharply after the first transfusion (from 2.55 × 104 to 1.39 × 103 copies/mL) and became undetectable after the second transfusion. Conclusions: With the substantial increase of COVID-19 in recent months,treatment for elderly patients has become restricted in some countries. The successful treatment of this 100-year-old patient using convalescent plasma suggests that we should consider adding convalescent plasma in th management of the elderly."
7832,Comparative performance and cycle threshold values of 10 nucleic acid amplification tests for SARS-CoV-2 on clinical samples.,"Background: A number of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for SARS-CoV-2 with different reagents have been approved for clinical use in Japan. These include research kits approved under emergency use authorization through simplified process to stabilize the supply of the reagents. Although these research kits have been increasingly used in clinical practice, limited data is available for the diagnostic performance in clinical settings. Methods: We compared sensitivity, specificity, and cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained by NAATs using 10 kits approved in Japan including eight kits those receiving emergency use authorization using 69 frozen-stored clinical samples including 23 positive samples with various Ct values and 46 negative samples. Results: Viral copy number of the frozen-stored samples determined with LightMix E-gene test ranged from 0.6 to 84521.1 copies/μL. While no false-positive results were obtained by any of these tests (specificity: 100% [95% CI, 88.9%-100%]), sensitivity of the nine tests ranged from 68.2% [95% CI, 45.1%-86.1%] to 95.5% [95% CI, 77.2%-99.9%] using LightMix E-gene test as the gold standard. All tests showed positive results for all samples with ≥100 copies/μL. Significant difference of Ct values even among tests amplifying the same genetic region (N1-CDC, N2) was also observed. Conclusion: Difference in the diagnostic performance was observed among NAATs approved in Japan. Regarding diagnostic kits for emerging infectious diseases, a system is needed to ensure both rapidity of reagent supply and accuracy of diagnosis. Ct values, which are sometimes regarded as a marker of infectivity, are not interchangeable when obtained by different assays."
7833,Interstitial pneumonitis in the COVID-19 era: a difficult differential diagnosis in patients with lung cancer.,"In this coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) era, when pneumonitis occurs in patients with lung cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a major challenge is to make a rapid and correct differential diagnosis among drug-induced pulmonary toxicity, tumour progression, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced pneumonitis. While waiting for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing results, an accurate evaluation of the symptoms and serologic features can help us make a first diagnostic hypothesis and quickly start correct treatment. Physicians need a collaborative effort to develop and share a common database reporting clinical (anosmia, dysgeusia), serologic, and radiologic data in ICI-treated patients with lung cancer developing interstitial disease to create an evidence-based clinical diagnostic algorithm. This tool will continue to be helpful when we emerge from the pandemic crisis into a world in which COVID-19 may not have been eradicated to better select the target population requiring the most resource-consuming PCR tests."
7834,SARS-CoV-2 in animals: From potential hosts to animal models.,"Within only one year after the first detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), nearly 100 million infections were reported in the human population globally, with more than two million fatal cases. While SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated from a natural wildlife reservoir, neither the immediate viral precursor nor the reservoir or intermediate hosts have been identified conclusively. Due to its zoonotic origin, SARS-CoV-2 may also be relevant to animals. Thus, to evaluate the host range of the virus and to assess the risk to act as potential animal reservoir, a large number of different animal species were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 or monitored in the field in the last months. In this review, we provide an update on studies describing permissive and resistant animal species. Using a scoring system based on viral genome detection subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, seroconversion, the development of clinical signs and transmission to conspecifics or humans, the susceptibility of diverse animal species was classified on a semi-quantitative scale. While major livestock species such as pigs, cattle and poultry are mostly resistant, companion animals appear moderately susceptible, while several model animal species used in research, including several Cricetidae species and non-human primates, are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By natural infections, it became obvious that American minks (Neovison vison) in fur farms, e.g., in the Netherlands and Denmark are highly susceptible resulting in local epidemics in these animals."
7835,Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 20h/501Y.V2 (B.1.351) from Malawi to Italy.,"We report here an imported case of SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.1.351 (also known as 20H/501Y.V2 or ""South African variant"" or VOC 202012/02) in a 66-years old symptomatic male who returned from Malawi to Italy."
7836,Optimal allocation of limited test resources for the quantification of COVID-19 infections.,"The systematic identification of infected individuals is critical for the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, the spread of the disease is mostly quantified by the reported numbers of infections, hospitalisations, recoveries and deaths; these quantities inform epidemiology models that provide forecasts for the spread of the epidemic and guide policy making. The veracity of these forecasts depends on the discrepancy between the numbers of reported, and unreported yet infectious, individuals. We combine Bayesian experimental design with an epidemiology model and propose a methodology for the optimal allocation of limited testing resources in space and time, which maximises the information gain for such unreported infections. The proposed approach is applicable at the onset and spread of the epidemic and can forewarn of a possible recurrence of the disease after relaxation of interventions. We examine its application in Switzerland; the open source software is, however, readily adaptable to countries around the world. We find that following the proposed methodology can lead to vastly less uncertain predictions for the spread of the disease, thus improving estimates of the effective reproduction number and the future number of unreported infections. This information can provide timely and systematic guidance for the effective identification of infectious individuals and for decision-making regarding lockdown measures and the distribution of vaccines."
7837,An Overview of Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Macau S.A.R.,"The Greater Bay Area of southern China has a population of over 71 million people. The area is well-connected with Hubei province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Macau, as the most densely populated city in the world, is very vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks. Since its return to the sovereignty of China 20 years ago, the city has experienced outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Swine flu, and COVID-19. At the time of writing, 10 confirmed imported/local transmission cases were recorded. The government undertook measures to attain and then maintain 40 days without new cases. In this article, we report on the 10 confirmed cases and discuss the measures that the Macau Special Administrative Region (S.A.R.) government undertook during the COVID-19 pandemic."
7838,Diagnostic yield of point-of-care ultrasound imaging of the lung in patients with COVID-19.,"Objectives: To assess the diagnostic yield of point-of-care ultrasound imaging in patients suspected of having noncritical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection but no apparent changes on a chest radiograph. Material and methods: Cross-sectional analysis of a case series including patients coming to an emergency department in March and April 2020 with mild-moderate respiratory symptoms suspected to be caused by SARS-CoV-2. A point-of-care ultrasound examination of the lungs was performed on all participants as part of routine clinical care. Ultrasound findings were compared according to the results of SARS-CoV-2 test results. Results: Fifty-eight patients with a median (interquartile range) age of 44.5 (34-67) years were enrolled; 42 (72.4%) were women. Twenty-seven (46.5%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ultrasound findings were consistent with interstitial pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 33 (56.9%). Most were in cases with testconfirmed COVID-19 (100% vs 22.2% of cases with no confirmation; P < .001). The most common ultrasound findings in confirmed COVID-19 cases were focal and confluent B-lines in the basal and posterior regions of the lung (R1, 85.2%; R2, 77.8%; L1, 88.9%; and L2, 88.9%) and associated pleural involvement (70.4%, 70.4%, 81.5%, and 85.2%, respectively). The sensitivity of point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 92.6% (95% CI, 75.7%-99.1%). Specificity was 85.2% (95% CI, 66.3%-95.8%); positive predictive value, 75.8% (95% CI, 59.6%- 91.9%); negative predictive value, 92% (95% CI, 74.0%-99.0%); and positive and negative likelihood ratios, 6.2 (95% CI, 6.0-6.5) and 0.1 (95% CI, 0.1-0.1), respectively. Conclusion: Point-of-care lung ultrasound could be useful for the diagnosis of noncritical SARS-CoV-2 infection when chest radiographs are inconclusive."
7839,Parallels in Sepsis and COVID-19 Conditions: Implications for Managing Severe COVID-19.,"Sepsis is a life-threatening systemic illness attributed to a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is a global burden killing ~11 million persons annually. In December 2019, a novel pneumonia condition termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged and has resulted in more than 1,535,982 deaths globally as of 8th December 2020. These two conditions share many pathophysiological and clinical features. Notably, both sepsis and COVID-19 patients experience consumptive thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, vascular microthrombosis, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, coagulopathy, septic shock, respiratory failure, fever, leukopenia, hypotension, leukocytosis, high cytokine production and high predisposition to opportunistic infections. Considering the parallels in the immunopathogenesis and pathophysiological manifestations of sepsis and COVID-19, it is highly likely that sepsis care, which has a well-established history in most health systems, could inform on COVID-19 management. In view of this, the present perspective compares the immunopathogenesis and pathophysiology of COVID-19 and non-SARS-CoV-2 induced sepsis, and lessons from sepsis that can be applicable to COVID-19 management."
