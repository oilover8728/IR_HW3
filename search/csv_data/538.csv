5370,Coronavirus disease 2019 and the revival of passive immunization: Antibody therapy for inhibiting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and preventing host cell infection: IUPHAR review: 31.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic stimulated both the scientific community and healthcare companies to undertake an unprecedented effort with the aim of understanding the molecular mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and developing effective therapeutic solutions. The peculiar immune response triggered by this virus, which seems to last only few months, led to a search for alternatives such as passive immunization in addition to conventional vaccinations. Convalescent sera, monoclonal antibodies selected from the most potent neutralizing binders induced by the virus infection, recombinant human single-domain antibodies, and binders of variable scaffold and different origin have been tested alone or in combination exploiting monovalent, multivalent and multispecific formats. In this review, we analyse the state of the research in this field and present a summary of the ongoing projects finalized to identify suitable molecules for therapies based on passive immunization."
5371,"Primary care nurses' preparedness for COVID-19 in the Western Cape province, South Africa.","Introduction: The novel coronavirus 2019 or COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a global public health crisis. Primary care (PC) nurses render first line care, or refer for more specialised services. Aim: To investigate the preparedness of PC nurses for COVID-19 in the Western Cape. Setting: The Western Cape province of South Africa. Methods: We administered an online survey, with closed and open-ended questions, to 83 Stellenbosch University postgraduate PC nursing students and alumni working in the Western Cape, between 03 July and 01 September 2020. Results: The results indicated that 43.3% of participants were confident about the infection, prevention, and control (IPC) training they received and 56.7% felt prepared to provide direct care to suspected cases of COVID-19. Primary care nurses were more comfortable to triage (78.3%) than to manage persons with COVID-19 (42.2%), indicating that they may not be functioning to the full capacity of their education and training. Adequate infrastructure was reported by less than a third of the participants (30.1%) and 59.1% reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available. Primary care nurses needed support in coping with stress (57.8%) although few (14.5%) reported access to mental health services. Conclusion: Primary care nurses were not prepared optimally for the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges included adequate training, infrastructure, the availability of personal protective equipment, COVID-19 testing of health care workers and management support. Primary care nurses need comprehensive support to manage stress and anxiety."

5373,[Cutaneous lesions in COVID-19 patients].,"Aside from the typical respiratory symptoms resulting from an infection with SARS-CoV-2, there are reports of cutaneous lesions in patients diagnosed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are reports of multiple groups of skin lesions presenting in different stages of this diagnosis. The most common reported groups are chilblains, vesicular eruptions, morbilliformexanthems, acute urticaria and livedo. It is unlikely that all these groups of skin lesions are distinctive of an infection with SARS-CoV-2. Chilblains of new onset, however, could possibly be a distinctive symptom of a mild/asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. It is recommended to consider an infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with these groups of skin lesions. Consider testing for SARS-CoV-2 and consult the dermatologist if needed, especially in case of chilblains, to ensure histopathological evaluation of the skin lesions to increase knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology."
5374,Antibody and B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.,"Antibodies, and the B cell and plasma cell populations responsible for their production, are key components of the human immune system's response to SARS-CoV-2, which has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, we review findings addressing the nature of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 and their role in protecting from infection or modulating COVID-19 disease severity. In just over a year, much has been learned, and replicated in independent studies, about human immune responses to this pathogen, contributing to the development of effective vaccines. Nevertheless, important questions remain about the duration and effectiveness of antibody responses, differences between immunity derived from infection compared to vaccination, the cellular basis for serological findings, and the extent to which viral variants will escape from current immunity."

5376,Extremely low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients in Israeli hospitals: a cross-sectional study.,"Objectives: We aimed to compare the prevalence of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) among clinical staff in designated COVID-19 units versus that among staff in similar units with no known or suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers (HCWs) in eight Israeli general hospitals. The survey involved a questionnaire and a PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We surveyed HCWs in COVID-19 units and comparison units (internal medicine and cardiology) between 30th April and 7th May 2020. Results: There were 522 participants: 291 from COVID-19 units and 231 from comparison units. Only one participant (0.2%, 95%CI: 0.005-1.1%)-an asymptomatic nurse on a COVID-19 unit-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In participating COVID-19 units there were two symptomatic HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 in the 2 weeks before the survey; both were infected by contact with a co-worker outside of the COVID-19 unit. Conclusions: The low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among HCWs, coupled with an absence of symptomatic COVID-19 acquired during patient care, suggest that Israel's national guidelines for personal protective equipment, which are consistent with those of the World Health Organization, adequately protect HCWs."
5377,Measuring COVID-19 vaccination coverage: an enhanced age-adjusted two-step floating catchment area model.,"Background: There are only limited studies on access to COVID-19 vaccines and identifying the most appropriate health centres for performing vaccination in metropolitan areas. This study aimed to measure potential spatial access to COVID-19 vaccination centres in Mashhad, the second-most populous city in Iran. Methods: The 2021 age structure of the urban census tracts was integrated into the enhanced two-step floating catchment area model to improve accuracy. The model was developed based on three different access scenarios: only public hospitals, only public healthcare centres and both (either hospitals or healthcare centres) as potential vaccination facilities. The weighted decision-matrix and analytic hierarchy process, based on four criteria (i.e. service area, accessibility index, capacity of vaccination centres and distance to main roads), were used to choose potential vaccination centres looking for the highest suitability for residents. Global Moran's index (GMI) was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation of the accessibility index in different scenarios and the proposed model. Results: There were 26 public hospitals and 271 public healthcare centres in the study area. Although the exclusive use of public healthcare centres for vaccination can provide the highest accessibility in the eastern and north-eastern parts of the study area, our findings indicate that including both public hospitals and public healthcare centres provide high accessibility to vaccination in central urban part. Therefore, a combination of public hospitals and public healthcare centres is recommended for efficient vaccination coverage. The value of GMI for the proposed model (accessibility to selected vaccination centres) was calculated as 0.53 (Z = 162.42, P < 0.01). Both GMI and Z-score values decreased in the proposed model, suggesting an enhancement in accessibility to COVID-19 vaccination services. Conclusions: The periphery and poor areas of the city had the least access to COVID-19 vaccination centres. Measuring spatial access to COVID-19 vaccination centres can provide valuable insights for urban public health decision-makers. Our model, coupled with geographical information systems, provides more efficient vaccination coverage by identifying the most suitable healthcare centres, which is of special importance when only few centres are available."
5378,Chest imaging findings in COVID-19 patients: a case series from Nigeria.,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic ravaging the whole world with large numbers of reported cases globally. It is a highly-contagious novel infectious disease that causes inflammation in the respiratory system. Chest imaging is a useful adjunct for diagnosis, documenting the extent of disease as well as observation of changes and is thus, strongly recommended in suspected COVID-19 cases, for initial evaluation, differential diagnoses and follow-up. Description of typical imaging findings abound worldwide with a dearth of similar publications in sub-Saharan Africa. This series documents the chest imaging findings from a single facility of four cases between the ages of 38 and 60 who all tested positive for COVID-19 with real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the nasopharyngeal swabs."
5379,Three-Tiered COVID-19 Cohorting Strategy and Implications for Memory-Care.,"An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) can be devastating for residents and staff. Difficulty identifying asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases and lack of vaccination or treatment options make management challenging. We created, implemented, and now present a guide to rapidly deploy point-prevalence testing and 3-tiered cohorting in an SNF to mitigate an outbreak. We outline key challenges to SNF cohorting."
