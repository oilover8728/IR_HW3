8700,Aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria due to poor oral hygiene potentially contributes to the aggravation of COVID-19.,"Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. Periodontitis, one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, leads to alveolar bone destruction and subsequent tooth loss, and develops due to pro-inflammatory cytokine production induced by periodontopathic bacteria. Periodontopathic bacteria are involved in respiratory diseases, including aspiration pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other systemic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Patients with these diseases have an increased COVID-19 aggravation rate and mortality. Because aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene can lead to COVID-19 aggravation. Conversely, oral care, including periodontal treatment, prevents the onset of pneumonia and influenza and the exacerbation of COPD. The reduced chance of receiving professional oral care owing to long-term hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 may increase the aggravation risk of infection in the lower respiratory tract. It can be hypothesized that periodontopathic bacteria are involved in the COVID-19 aggravation and therefore, the management of good oral hygiene potentially contributes to its prevention."
8701,Comparing infectivity and virulence of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian hamsters.,"Background: Within one year after its emergence, more than 108 million people acquired SARS-CoV-2 and almost 2·4 million succumbed to COVID-19. New SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) are emerging all over the world, with the threat of being more readily transmitted, being more virulent, or escaping naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. At least three major prototypic VoC have been identified, i.e. the United Kingdom, UK (B.1.1.7), South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (B.1.1.28.1) variants. These are replacing formerly dominant strains and sparking new COVID-19 epidemics. Methods: We studied the effect of infection with prototypic VoC from both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants in female Syrian golden hamsters to assess their relative infectivity and virulence in direct comparison to two basal SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in early 2020. Findings: A very efficient infection of the lower respiratory tract of hamsters by these VoC is observed. In line with clinical evidence from patients infected with these VoC, no major differences in disease outcome were observed as compared to the original strains as was quantified by (i) histological scoring, (ii) micro-computed tomography, and (iii) analysis of the expression profiles of selected antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Noteworthy however, in hamsters infected with VoC B.1.1.7, a particularly strong elevation of proinflammatory cytokines was detected. Interpretation: We established relevant preclinical infection models that will be pivotal to assess the efficacy of current and future vaccine(s) (candidates) as well as therapeutics (small molecules and antibodies) against two important SARS-CoV-2 VoC. Funding: Stated in the acknowledgment."
8702,"First performance report of QIAreach Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Test, an innovative nanoparticle fluorescence digital detection platform.","In 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic. Disease diagnosis, appropriate clinical management and infection control are all important factors in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The QIAreach™ Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Test (Anti-CoV2) is a rapid, qualitative serological test, using proprietary nanoparticle fluorescence technology to detect total antibody (IgA, IgM, and IgG) against SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the results of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clinical agreement study. Thirty positive plasma or serum samples were taken from consenting individuals with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection ≥14 days from symptom onset. Seventy-five samples from before the believed circulation of SARS-CoV-2 (November 1, 2019) were used to assess specificity. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated along with the corresponding exact two-sided 95 % confidence intervals (CI) using an FDA Emergency Use Authorized PCR test as the reference method. Anti-CoV2 was shown to have 100 % sensitivity (PPA; 95 % CI 88.4-100 %) and 100 % specificity (NPA; 95 % CI 95.2-100 %). Against 157 pre-pandemic samples, no cross-reactivity was observed with seasonal coronaviruses or other respiratory pathogens tested. Additionally, no interference was observed when samples were spiked with: conjugated bilirubin 0.4 mg/ml; unconjugated bilirubin 0.4 mg/ml; hemoglobin 5 mg/ml; prednisolone 0.12 mg/ml; triglycerides 15 mg/ml. In conclusion, Anti-CoV2 provides accurate qualitative detection of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2."

8704,COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Are Generally Safe in the Short Term: A Vaccine Vigilance Real-World Study Says.,"Background: The prophylactic vaccination of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is the first large-scale application of this kind in the human world. Over 1.8 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in the US until December 2020, and around 0.2% submitted AE reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This study aimed to evaluate the AEs following immunization (AEFIs) and analyze the potential associations based on the information from the VAERS database. Methods: We searched the VAERS database recorded AEFIs after COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020. After data mapping, we summarized demographic and clinical features of reported cases. Fisher exact test was used to comparing the clinical characteristics among AE groups with an anaphylactic response, concerning neurological disorders and death. Results: VAERS reported 3,908 AEFIs of COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020. Most (79.68%) were reported after the first dose of the vaccine. Among the reported cases, we found that general disorders (48.80%), nervous system disorders (46.39%), and gastrointestinal disorders (25.54%) were the most common AEFIs. The allergy history was more frequent in vaccine recipients with anaphylactic reactions than those without (64.91% vs. 49.62%, OR = 1.88, P <0.017). History of anxiety or depression was more common in subjects reporting severe neurological AEFIs than those reporting other AEFIs (18.37% vs. 7.85%, OR = 2.64, P <0.017). Cases reporting death were significantly older (79.36 ± 10.41-year-old vs. 42.64 ± 12.55-year-old, P <0.01, 95% CI 29.30-44.15) and more likely experienced hypertension (50.00% vs. 11.42%, OR = 7.76, P <0.01) and neurological disorders (50.00% vs. 5.36%, OR = 17.65, P <0.01) than other vaccine recipients. The outpatient and emergency room visit rates were 11.92 and 22.42% for AEFIs, and 2.53% of cases needed hospitalization. Conclusion: AEFIs of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were generally non-severe local or systemic reactions. A prior allergy history is the risk factor for anaphylaxis, while a history of anxiety may link with severe neurological AEs. Such vaccine recipients need further evaluation and monitor."
8705,Geographical tracking and mapping of coronavirus disease COVID-19/severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic and associated events around the world: how 21st century GIS technologies are supporting the global fight against outbreaks and epidemics.,"In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world, despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics."
8706,Antibody response in COVID-19 patients with and without re-positive RT-PCR results during the convalescent phase.,"Nucleic acid testing and antibody testing data from 143 recovered COVID-19 patients during the convalescent phase were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 23 (16.1%) recovered patients re-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Three months after symptom onset, 100% and 99.3% of the patients remained positive for total and IgG antibodies, and the antibody levels remained high. IgM antibodies declined rapidly, with a median time to seroconversion of 67 (95% CI: 59, 75) days after onset. Approximately 25% of patients were seronegative for IgA antibodies at three months after onset. There was no statistically significant difference in antibody kinetics between patients with and without re-positive RT-PCR results during the convalescent phase."
8707,Isoelectric point determination by imaged CIEF of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the hACE2 receptor.,"In order to contribute to the scientific research on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we have investigated the isoelectric points (pI) of several related proteins, which are commercially available: the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with His- and Fc-tag, the S1 subunit with His-tag, the S1/S2 subunits with His-tag and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) with His-tag. First, the theoretical pI values, based on the amino acid (AA) sequences of the proteins, were calculated using the ProtParam tool from the Bioinformatics Resource Portal ExPASy. The proteins were then measured with the Maurice imaged CIEF system (native fluorescence detection), testing various measurement conditions, such as different ampholytes or ampholyte mixtures. Due to isoforms, we get sections with several peaks and not just one peak for each protein. The determined pI range for the RBD/Fc is 8.24-9.32 (theoretical pI: 8.55), for the RBD/His it is 7.36-9.88 (8.91) and for the S1/His it is 7.30-8.37 (7.80). The pI range of the S1/S2/His is 4.41-5.87 (no theoretical pI, AA sequence unknown) and for hACE2/His, the determined global range is 5.19-6.11 (5.60) for all experimental conditions chosen. All theoretically derived values were found within these ranges, usually close to the center. Therefore, we consider theoretical values as useful to make predictions about the isoelectric points of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The experimental conditions had only a minor influence on the pI ranges obtained and mainly influenced the peak shapes."
8708,Neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 - a systematic review.,"Introduction: Following two coronaviral epidemics in 2002 and 2012, December 2019 saw the emergence of a potentially fatal coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China. While most coronaviruses are responsible for mild respiratory infections, they have been demonstrated to be neuroinvasive and neurotropic for over three decades. In this review, we assess whether SARS-CoV-2 follows this trend and if the neuroinvasive potential of this novel coronavirus is worthy of further investigation. Methods: To obtain sources for this study, we performed an online search through Pubmed, Researchgate and Google Scholar, finding 537 articles. After analysing them according to PRISMA, we included 14 in this review. Discussion: Data regarding neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 is scarce and mostly inconsistent. There are however identifiable trends which might provide a basis for future research. There is strong evidence that this novel coronavirus may be neuroinvasive and could cause a wide array of neurological symptoms and complications. Cerebrospinal fluid testing may shed more light on the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system. Clarification of the respiratory failure mechanisms requires post mortem examinations and brain tissue analysis, and further research is of the utmost importance. However, we strongly believe that the existing evidence is enough to raise awareness among clinicians and help guide them through the diagnosis and optimal therapy of COVID-19 patients."
