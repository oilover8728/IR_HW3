6050,Identification of presented SARS-CoV-2 HLA class I and HLA class II peptides using HLA peptidomics.,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-bound viral antigens serve as an immunological signature that can be selectively recognized by T cells. As viruses evolve by acquiring mutations, it is essential to identify a range of presented viral antigens. Using HLA peptidomics, we are able to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-derived peptides presented by highly prevalent HLA class I (HLA-I) molecules by using infected cells as well as overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 genes. We find 26 HLA-I peptides and 36 HLA class II (HLA-II) peptides. Among the identified peptides, some are shared between different cells and some are derived from out-of-frame open reading frames (ORFs). Seven of these peptides were previously shown to be immunogenic, and we identify two additional immunoreactive peptides by using HLA multimer staining. These results may aid the development of the next generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on presented viral-specific antigens that span several of the viral genes."
6051,Strategy to identify priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination: A population based cohort study.,"Background: Evidence from COVID-19 outbreak shows that individuals with specific chronic diseases are at higher risk of severe prognosis after infection. Public health authorities are developing vaccination programmes with priorities that minimize the risk of mortality and severe events in individuals and communities. We propose an evidence-based strategy that targets the frailest subjects whose timely vaccination is likely to minimize future deaths and preserve the resilience of the health service by preventing infections. Methods: The cohort includes 146,087 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Milan (3.49 million inhabitants). Individual level data on 42 chronic diseases and vital status updated as of January 21, 2021, were available in administrative data. Analyses were performed in three sub-cohorts of age (16-64, 65-79 and 80+ years) and comorbidities affecting mortality were selected by means of LASSO cross-validated conditional logistic regression. Simplified models based on previous results identified high-risk categories worth targeting with highest priority. Results adjusted by age and gender, were reported in terms of odds ratios and 95%CI. Results: The final models include as predictors of mortality (7,667 deaths, 5.2%) 10, 12, and 5 chronic diseases, respectively. The older age categories shared, as risk factors, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases. In the younger age category, predictors included neoplasm, organ transplantation and psychiatric conditions. Results were consistent with those obtained on mortality at 60 days from diagnosis (6,968 deaths). Conclusion: This approach defines a two-level stratification for priorities in the vaccination that can easily be applied by health authorities, eventually adapted to local results in terms of number and types of comorbidities, and rapidly updated with current data. After the early phase of vaccination, data on effectiveness and safety will give the opportunity to revise prioritization and discuss the future approach in the remaining population."
6052,"Policy-Relevant Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccination: Associations With Demography, Health Risk, and Social and Political Factors.","Background: Vaccination is considered to be a key public health intervention to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the success of the intervention is contingent on attitudes toward vaccination and the design of vaccination policies. Methods: We conduct cross-sectional analyses of policy-relevant attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination using survey data of a representative sample of Austrian residents collected by the Austrian Corona Panel Project (ACPP). As outcomes, we examine the individual readiness to get vaccinated, the support for compulsory vaccinations, and the preference for making the vaccine available free of charge. The independent variables include demographics, objective and perceived health risks, and social and political factors. Results: Although there is broad public support for making the vaccine available free of charge, vaccine hesitancy and the opposition to a vaccine mandate are widespread. The protective function of the vaccine for the individual only motivates limited support for vaccinations. Opposition to COVID-19 vaccination also stems from a lack of sense of community and an ongoing politicization of the issue through conspiracy theories and party politics. Conclusion: We propose that overcoming the inherent free-rider problem of achieving sufficiently high vaccination rates poses a potential dilemma for policymakers: Given the politicized nature of the issue, they may find themselves having to choose between making vaccinations compulsory at political costs and a lingering pandemic at high costs for public health and the economy. We propose that promoting a sense of community and addressing potential practical constraints will be key in designing an effective COVID-19 vaccination policy."
6053,Acute Ischemic Hemorrhagic Stroke in Two COVID-19 Patients.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). First identified in December 2019, in Wuhan, China, it has since become a global pandemic. Complications of COVID-19 are not limited to the pulmonary system, but also include neurologic manifestations such as stroke. We report two cases of coincidental presentation of COVID-19 and cerebrovascular accident. Further studies are needed for a comprehensive understanding of the neurological pathology of COVID-19 and its effects on the nervous system, but stroke teams should be wary of the fact that COVID-19 patients may present with cerebrovascular accidents."
6054,Does tetanus vaccination contribute to reduced severity of the COVID-19 infection?,"We present the hypothesis to the scientific community actively designing clinical trials and recommending public health guidelines to control the pandemic that - ""Tetanus vaccination may be contributing to reduced severity of the COVID-19 infection"" - and urge further research to validate or invalidate the effectiveness of the tetanus toxoid vaccine against COVID-19. This hypothesis was revealed by an explainable artificial intelligence system unleashed on open public biomedical datasets. As a foundation for scientific rigor, we describe the data and the artificial intelligence system, document the provenance and methodology used to derive the hypothesis and also gather potentially relevant data/evidence from recent studies. We conclude that while correlations may not be reason for causation, correlations from multiple sources is more than a serendipitous coincidence that is worthy of further and deeper investigation."
6055,"Halo, Reversed Halo, or Both? Atypical Computed Tomography Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia: The ""Double Halo Sign"".","The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus, later named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19), began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has spread rapidly worldwide. Early diagnosis is crucial for the management of the patients with COVID-19, but the gold standard diagnostic test for this infection, the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, has a low sensitivity and an increased turnaround time. In this scenario, chest computed tomography (CT) could play a key role for an early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Here, we have reported a confirmed case of COVID-19 with an atypical CT presentation showing a ""double halo sign,"" which we believe represents the pathological spectrum of this viral pneumonia."
6056,[The comparative analysis of population attitude to vaccination against COVID-19 infection in foreign countries and in Russia].,"The COVID-19 vaccination is considered as decisive factor in termination of pandemic. Hence, the vaccine development and clinical trials are carried on in an accelerated rate. At that, success of any mass immunization program, including its global application, directly depends on population willingness to be vaccinated. The purpose of the study is to investigate opinions about COVID-19 vaccination in various countries and to identify factors contributing to or hindering to increasing commitment to immunization. Methods and materials: The search of relevant data was implemented through such bibliographic databases as eLIBRARY.RU, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar. Moreover, the primary research data concerning opinions of Russians about coronavirus infection vaccination was analyzed. Results: The cross-country study of opinions about COVID-19 vaccination permitted to identify main factors impacting degree of readiness to mass immunization, including fear and personal perceptions of risk of COVID-19 infection, attitudes to influenza vaccination and fear of vaccination, mainly due to disinformation about efficiency, efficacy and safety of the vaccine. Conclusion: The conclusion was made that public opinion surveys implemented in various countries are important because they provide priceless information for implementing public policy targeted to improve health care support, in particular to develop effective vaccination campaigns against COVID-19, identifying high-risk groups, socially and economically vulnerable individuals for whom vaccination is to be paramount and free, and also setting vaccination fees for other groups based on their readiness to pay."
6057,Editorial: Revised World Health Organization (WHO) Terminology for Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest of SARS-CoV-2.,"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has identified thousands of genome sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 31st May 2021, the Virus Evolution Working Group of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced its recommendations for revised naming of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs). This new nomenclature system may improve infection monitoring, infection control, and sharing of research data on viral genomics and epidemiology. This Editorial aims to present an update on the current revised WHO terminology for the genomic VOCs and VOIs of SARS-CoV-2."
6058,Peptide Platform as a Powerful Tool in the Fight against COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global pandemic causing over 195 million infections and more than 4 million fatalities as of July 2021.To date, it has been demonstrated that a number of mutations in the spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern abrogate or reduce the neutralization potency of several therapeutic antibodies and vaccine-elicited antibodies. Therefore, the development of additional vaccine platforms with improved supply and logistic profile remains a pressing need. In this work, we have validated the applicability of a peptide-based strategy focused on a preventive as well as a therapeutic purpose. On the basis of the involvement of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), in addition to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the mechanism of virus entry, we analyzed peptides bearing DPP4 sequences by protein-protein docking and assessed their ability to block pseudovirus infection in vitro. In parallel, we have selected and synthetized peptide sequences located within the highly conserved receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, and we found that RBD-based vaccines could better promote elicitation of high titers of neutralizing antibodies specific against the regions of interest, as confirmed by immunoinformatic methodologies and in vivo studies. These findings unveil a key antigenic site targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies and pave the way to the design of pan-coronavirus vaccines."
6059,Efficient maternal to neonatal transfer of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.,"BACKGROUNDThe significant risks posed to mothers and fetuses by COVID-19 in pregnancy have sparked a worldwide debate surrounding the pros and cons of antenatal SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, as we lack sufficient evidence regarding vaccine effectiveness in pregnant women and their offspring. We aimed to provide substantial evidence for the effect of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine versus native infection on maternal humoral, as well as transplacentally acquired fetal immune response, potentially providing newborn protection.METHODSA multicenter study where parturients presenting for delivery were recruited at 8 medical centers across Israel and assigned to 3 study groups: vaccinated (n = 86); PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected during pregnancy (n = 65), and unvaccinated noninfected controls (n = 62). Maternal and fetal blood samples were collected from parturients prior to delivery and from the umbilical cord following delivery, respectively. Sera IgG and IgM titers were measured using the Milliplex MAP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel (for S1, S2, RBD, and N).RESULTSThe BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine elicits strong maternal humoral IgG response (anti-S and RBD) that crosses the placenta barrier and approaches maternal titers in the fetus within 15 days following the first dose. Maternal to neonatal anti-COVID-19 antibodies ratio did not differ when comparing sensitization (vaccine vs. infection). IgG transfer ratio at birth was significantly lower for third-trimester as compared with second trimester infection. Lastly, fetal IgM response was detected in 5 neonates, all in the infected group.CONCLUSIONAntenatal BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination induces a robust maternal humoral response that effectively transfers to the fetus, supporting the role of vaccination during pregnancy.FUNDINGIsrael Science Foundation and the Weizmann Institute Fondazione Henry Krenter."
