6272,Behavioral Intention to Receive a COVID-19 Vaccination Among Chinese Factory Workers: Cross-sectional Online Survey.,"Background: COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China soon. Understanding communities' responses to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines is important. We applied the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. Objective: This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with behavioral intention to receive self-financed or free COVID-19 vaccinations among Chinese factory workers who resumed work during the pandemic. We examined the effects of factors including sociodemographics, perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination, exposure to information about COVID-19 vaccination through social media, and COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by individuals and factories. Methods: Participants were full-time employees 18 years or older who worked in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive a physical examination annually. Eligible workers attending six physical examination sites were invited to complete a survey on September 1-7, 2020. Out of 2653 eligible factory workers, 2053 (77.4%) completed the online survey. Multivariate two-level logistic regression models and ordinal logistic regression models were fitted. Results: The prevalence of behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was 66.6% (n=1368, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate) and 80.6% (n=1655, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and free vaccines). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.25 and AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), perceived support from significant others for getting a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32-1.55 and AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25-1.50), and perceived behavioral control to get a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.32-1.73 and AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51) were positively associated with both dependent variables (conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate or free vaccines, respectively). Regarding social media influence, higher frequency of exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination at market rate (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.70) or a free vaccination (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.71). Higher self-reported compliance with wearing a face mask in the workplace (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.58 and AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.27) and other public spaces (AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.42-2.29 and AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.77), hand hygiene (AOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.47 and AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.19-1.93), and avoiding social gatherings (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47 and AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.95) and crowded places (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51 and AOR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37-2.18) were also positively associated with both dependent variables. The number of COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by the factory was positively associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination under both scenarios (AOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12 and AOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). Conclusions: Factory workers in China reported a high behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. The theory of planned behavior is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination."

6274,SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 escapes neutralization by South African COVID-19 donor plasma.,"SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), a novel lineage of coronavirus causing COVID-19, contains substitutions in two immunodominant domains of the spike protein. Here, we show that pseudovirus expressing 501Y.V2 spike protein completely escapes three classes of therapeutically relevant antibodies. This pseudovirus also exhibits substantial to complete escape from neutralization, but not binding, by convalescent plasma. These data highlight the prospect of reinfection with antigenically distinct variants and foreshadows reduced efficacy of spike-based vaccines."
6275,Healthcare staff perceptions and misconceptions regarding antibody testing in the United Kingdom: implications for the next steps for antibody screening.,"Background: Healthcare workers have been at increased risk of exposure, infection and serious complications from COVID-19. Antibody testing has been used to identify staff members who have been previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, and has been rolled out rapidly in the United Kingdom. A number of comment and editorial articles have been published that raise concerns about antibody testing in this context. We present perceptions of National Health Service (NHS) healthcare workers in relation to SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Methods: An electronic survey regarding perceptions towards SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was distributed to all healthcare workers at a major NHS tertiary hospital following implementation of antibody testing. Results: In total, 560 healthcare workers completed the survey (80% female; 25% of Black and Minority Ethnic background; 58% from frontline clinical staff). Exploring whether they previously had COVID-19 was the primary reported reason for choosing to undergo antibody testing (85.2%). In case of a positive antibody test, 72% reported that they would feel relieved, whilst 48% felt that they would be happier to work in a patient-facing area. Moreover, 12% responded that a positive test would mean ""social distancing is less important"", with 34% of the responders indicating that in this case they would be both less likely to catch COVID-19 and happier to visit friends/relatives. Conclusions: NHS staff members primarily seek out SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing for an appropriate reason. Based on our findings and given the lack of definite data regarding the extent of immunity protection from a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, significant concerns may be raised regarding the reported interpretation by healthcare workers of positive antibody test results. This needs to be further explored and addressed to protect NHS staff and patients."
6276,Codon bias analysis may be insufficient for identifying host(s) of a novel virus.,"A novel kind of coronavirus has infected more than 1, 600, 000 people, claimed over 100, 000 lives, and spread to 212 countries and territories since December 2019.1 The virus has been named SARS‐CoV‐2 (provisionally termed 2019‐nCoV before2), and the pneumonia caused by it is COVID‐19. Though many scientists and researchers are trying to identify the animals harboring SARS‐CoV‐2, the intermediate host remains under the veil. This article is protected by copyright.

6277,Current treatment approaches for COVID-19 and the clinical value of transfusion-related technologies.,"COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which is a new enveloped virus that belongs to the Beta coronavirus genus. As a major health crisis, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over a million people around the world. There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been used in clinical practice. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and discusses the clinical value of blood transfusion-related technologies used in COVID-19 treatment."

6279,Progression of Disease in COVID-19 Patients Evaluated by Chest CT Imgaing and Correlated with Clinical Parameters.,"The objective of the study was to investigate and quantify the severity of COVID-19 infection by high resolution computed tomography (CT) of chest and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. This study also aimed to see CT changes with clinical recovery or progression of disease. This cross sectional study was performed from July 20 to August 20, 2020, where both chest HRCT and clinical features were included in laboratory confirmed COVID-19, 100 patients, attending the depertment of Radiology & Imaging, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study included clinical symptoms, comorbidities of patients, HRCT chest characteristics, CT severity score. After collection of all required data and careful medical chest review, the clinical data of laboratory confirmed patients was compiled and tabulated. In this study group out of 100 patients, most of the patients were in 5th & 6th dacades with a mean age of 53.7 years. In this study out of 100 patients 72% were male and 28% were female with an average sex ratio of male : female being 2.5:1. Prevalance of various clinical presentation in this study sample population distributed as fever in 76% cough in 77.4%, shortness of breath in 55%, sore throat in 17% were the most common clinical manifestations while a few patients (13.2%) also had other symptoms like headache, chest tightnes, anosmia and diarrhoea. Major comorbid conditions were diabets mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma and Chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patient with comorbid disease, especially if multiple had higher symptomatic presentation. Out of 100 patients 75.5% patient had co-morbidity where as 24.5% ptaients did not have any co-existing disease. According to HRCT imaging severity score the lung pathological changes were evaluated, when typical covid findings in 80%, intermediate in 10%, atypical in 2% and normal chest CT findings in 8% patients. Symptomatic presentation had found higher (85.21%) who had CT severity index >15/25 while sympotomatic presentation lesser (14.79%) who had CT severity index <15/25. CT severity index of 1-5 was seen in 20(21.73%) patients, 6-10 in 38(41.30%) patients, 11-15 in 22(23.91% patients, 16-20 in 10(10.86%) patients and 21-25 in 2(2.17%). As positive CT findings were more prominent in symptomatic and co-morbid patients HRCT chest in COVID-19 patient had a major diagnostic and prognostic importance. Clinical symptoms of patients directly correlated with CT severity score. Therefore, CT imaging was found to be useful in predicting clinical recovery of patient or progression of disease."
