6390,Sample-to-answer COVID-19 nucleic acid testing using a low-cost centrifugal microfluidic platform with bead-based signal enhancement and smartphone read-out.,"With its origin estimated around December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a major global health challenge. The demand for scalable, rapid and sensitive viral diagnostics is thus particularly pressing at present to help contain the rapid spread of infection and prevent overwhelming the capacity of health systems. While high-income countries have managed to rapidly expand diagnostic capacities, such is not the case in resource-limited settings of low- to medium-income countries. Aiming at developing cost-effective viral load detection systems for point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostics in resource-limited and resource-rich settings alike, we report the development of an integrated modular centrifugal microfluidic platform to perform loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of viral RNA directly from heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal swab samples. The discs were pre-packed with dried n-benzyl-n-methylethanolamine modified agarose beads used to selectively remove primer dimers, inactivate the reaction post-amplification and allowing enhanced fluorescence detection via a smartphone camera. Sample-to-answer analysis within 1 hour from sample collection and a detection limit of approximately 100 RNA copies in 10 μL reaction volume were achieved. The platform was validated with a panel of 162 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from patients with COVID-19 symptoms, providing a sensitivity of 96.6% (82.2-99.9%, 95% CI) for samples with Ct values below 26 and a specificity of 100% (90-100%, 95% CI), thus being fit-for-purpose to diagnose patients with a high risk of viral transmission. These results show significant promise towards bringing routine point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostics to resource-limited settings."
6391,Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission and Pathogenesis.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) marks the third highly pathogenic coronavirus to spill over into the human population. SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible with a broad tissue tropism that is likely perpetuating the pandemic. However, important questions remain regarding its transmissibility and pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize current SARS-CoV-2 research, with an emphasis on transmission, tissue tropism, viral pathogenesis, and immune antagonism. We further present advances in animal models that are important for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development, and therapeutic testing. When necessary, comparisons are made from studies with SARS to provide further perspectives on coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as draw inferences for future investigations."

6393,The presence of anti-leucocyte antibodies in the plasma of convalescent women after SARS-CoV-2 infection as a reason for disqualification for plasma therapy - analysis based on a literature review.,"According to the data from November 29 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was responsible for 61 866 635 cases of infections and 1 448 990 deaths worldwide, and the number is still growing rapidly. The main problem is the rapid increase in the number of patients with pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure. In the treatment of COVID- 19 patients, a significant effect of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy from convalescent patients with SARS-CoV-2 IgG neutralizing antibodies is indicated. After this procedure, the total duration of the infection was shortened and the clinical condition improved faster than in patients who did not receive this form of therapy. The aim of the study was to explain the cause disqualifying women with anti-leucocyte anitibodies as CP plasma donors for COVID-19 patients. However, according to the literature, 2% of patients who received plasma from convalescents developed Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI). The most common causes of TRALI are anti-leukocyte antibodies directed against Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) class I and II and against Human Neutrophil Antigens (HNA). Therefore, patients with COVID-19 may only be transfused with plasma from convalescent women with a history of pregnancy after testing negative for anti-leucocyte antibodies in the pre-plasmapheresis blood sample."
6394,Early trends for SARS-CoV-2 infection in central and north Texas and impact on other circulating respiratory viruses.,"Rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in Wuhan province in China. SARS-CoV-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March 2020. This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. More than 3500 tests were performed during the first 2 weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1659 emergency department/inpatients tested were positive. The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25 to 34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged <25 years old (2%). County-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS-CoV-2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2. Data extracted for BSWH from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared with 25% in March 2019. This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2."
6395,Informed consent and informed intervention: SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations not just call for disclosure of newly emerging safety data but also for hypothesis generation and testing.,"Background: COVID-19 infection is a major threat to patients and health care providers around the world. One solution is the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We performed a comprehensive query of the latest publications on the prevention of viral infections including the recent vaccination program and its side effects. Results: The situation is evolving rapidly and there is no reasonable alternative to population-scale vaccination programs as currently enrolled. Conclusion: Therefore, regulatory authorities should consider supplementing their conventional mandate of post-approval pharmacovigilance, which is based on the collection, assessment, and regulatory response to emerging safety findings."
