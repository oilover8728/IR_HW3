6260,Attitudes of Healthcare Personnel towards Vaccinations before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Vaccines constitute highly effective tools for controlling and eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) and are assessed to avert between two to three million deaths per year globally. Healthcare personnel (HCP) constitute a priority group for several vaccinations. However, studies indicate significant rates of vaccine hesitancy among them and, therefore, of acceptance of vaccination recommendations. This cross-sectional study was conducted in a university hospital in Southern Italy to assess the knowledge and attitudes of HCP about VPDs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, estimate their intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and search for determinants that may influence their choice. A self-administered questionnaire was used. HCP improved their knowledge about VPDs and were more favorable to vaccinations in September-December 2020 compared to January-December 2019. Overall, 75% of respondents would get a COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings indicate a potential role of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Italian HCP's knowledge and attitudes towards vaccines."
6261,Screening maternity populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"With no end in sight to the outbreak of COVID‐19, countries are struggling with strategies to halt the “second wave” and mitigate economic decline. Estimated to account for around half of the infections, asymptomatic transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 has been hampering the containment of the virus. A positive case rate of 10% was reported by Prabhu et al. among 625 pregnant women who were universally screened for SARS‐CoV‐2 on the day of admission for delivery at 3 institutions in New York City, of which 80% were asymptomatic at the time of testing, including pre‐ and post‐symptomatic patients (BJOG 2020 xxxx)."
6262,COVID-19 TestNorm: A tool to normalize COVID-19 testing names to LOINC codes.,"Large observational data networks that leverage routine clinical practice data in electronic health records (EHRs) are critical resources for research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data normalization is a key challenge for the secondary use of EHRs for COVID-19 research across institutions. In this study, we addressed the challenge of automating the normalization of COVID-19 diagnostic tests, which are critical data elements, but for which controlled terminology terms were published after clinical implementation. We developed a simple but effective rule-based tool called COVID-19 TestNorm to automatically normalize local COVID-19 testing names to standard LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) codes. COVID-19 TestNorm was developed and evaluated using 568 test names collected from 8 healthcare systems. Our results show that it could achieve an accuracy of 97.4% on an independent test set. COVID-19 TestNorm is available as an open-source package for developers and as an online Web application for end users (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/loinc.php). We believe that it will be a useful tool to support secondary use of EHRs for research on COVID-19."
6263,"Development, evaluation, and validation of machine learning models for COVID-19 detection based on routine blood tests.","Objectives: The rRT-PCR test, the current gold standard for the detection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), presents with known shortcomings, such as long turnaround time, potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates around 15-20%, and expensive equipment. The hematochemical values of routine blood exams could represent a faster and less expensive alternative. Methods: Three different training data set of hematochemical values from 1,624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive), admitted at San Raphael Hospital (OSR) from February to May 2020, were used for developing machine learning (ML) models: the complete OSR dataset (72 features: complete blood count (CBC), biochemical, coagulation, hemogasanalysis and CO-Oxymetry values, age, sex and specific symptoms at triage) and two sub-datasets (COVID-specific and CBC dataset, 32 and 21 features respectively). 58 cases (50% COVID-19 positive) from another hospital, and 54 negative patients collected in 2018 at OSR, were used for internal-external and external validation. Results: We developed five ML models: for the complete OSR dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.83 to 0.90; for the COVID-specific dataset from 0.83 to 0.87; and for the CBC dataset from 0.74 to 0.86. The validations also achieved good results: respectively, AUC from 0.75 to 0.78; and specificity from 0.92 to 0.96. Conclusions: ML can be applied to blood tests as both an adjunct and alternative method to rRT-PCR for the fast and cost-effective identification of COVID-19-positive patients. This is especially useful in developing countries, or in countries facing an increase in contagions."
6264,Longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis following ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 vaccine: a case report.,"Background: Transverse myelitis (TM) is a relatively uncommon condition, and vaccine-associated myelitis is even rarer. Concern regarding neurological complications following vaccination escalated following the report of TM during the safety and efficacy trials of the COVID-19 vaccine. Case presentation: We report the first case of Longitudinal Extensive Transverse Myelitis (LETM) in Malaysia following administration of the chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine. A 25-year-old female presented with bilateral lower limb weakness and inability to walk with a sensory level up to T8 with absent visual symptoms. Urgent gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed long segment TM over the thoracic region. Cerebrospinal fluid autoantibodies for anti-aquaporin-4 and anti-myelin-oligodendrocyte were negative. A diagnosis of LETM following vaccination was made, and the patient was started on a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone. The patient eventually made a recovery following treatment. Conclusion: LETM is a rare but serious adverse reaction following vaccination. Previously reported cases showed an onset of symptoms between 10 to 14 days post-vaccination, suggesting a delayed immunogenic reaction. However, the incidence of myelitis in COVID-19 is much more common, far greater than the risk associated with vaccination."
6265,New-onset Nephrotic Syndrome after Janssen COVID-19 Vaccination: a Case Report and Literature Review.,"Various coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are being developed, which show practical preventive effects. Here, we report a 51-year-old healthy man with nephrotic syndrome secondary to minimal change disease (MCD) after Ad26.COV.2 (Janssen) vaccination. He had no comorbid disease and received Ad26.COV.2 on April 13, 2021. Seven days after vaccination, he developed edema and foamy urine. Edema rapidly aggravated with decreased urine volume. He was admitted to the hospital 28 days after vaccination, and his body weight increased by 21 kg after vaccination. His serum creatinine level was 1.54 mg/dL, and 24-h urinary protein excretion was 8.6 g/day. Kidney biopsy revealed no abnormality in the glomeruli and interstitium of the cortex and medulla under the light microscope. Electron microscopy revealed diffuse effacement of the podocyte foot processes, thus, he was diagnosed with MCD. High-dose steroid therapy was applied, and his kidney function improved three days after steroid therapy. Three weeks after steroid use, his serum creatinine decreased to 0.95 mg/dL, and spot urine protein-to-creatine decreased to 0.2 g/g. This case highlights the risk of new-onset nephrotic syndrome secondary to MCD after vectored COVID-19 vaccination. Although the pathogenesis is uncertain, clinicians need to be careful about adverse renal effects of COVID-19 vaccines."
6266,SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the central nervous: a brief review.,"There is increasing evidence of the ability of the novel coronavirus to invade the central nervous system (CNS). But how does a respiratory virus invade the highly protected CNS? Here, we reviewed available literature and case reports to determine CNS involvement in COVID-19, and to identify potential regions of the brain that may be affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its possible route of entry into the brain to identify its pathogenicity. Based on the symptoms, the parietal lobe and the cerebellum are the likely targets of SARS-CoV-2; however, further work is needed to elucidate this. The presence of ACE2, used by SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry, in the brain as well as detection of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid, further assert that SARS-COV-2 targets the brain, and therefore, medical practitioners should take that into account when dealing with patients suffering from COVID-19."
6267,[Which sampling method for the upper respiratory tract specimen should be taken to diagnose patient with COVID-19?].,新型冠状病毒肺炎正在中国肆虐，特别是在湖北武汉，对人民生命健康和经济造成了极大的损失。根据中国疾病预防控制中心（Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention，CDC）指南，新型冠状病毒肺炎患者的确诊及治愈均需核酸检测结果确认。上呼吸道取样方法是核酸检测的主要样本来源，但在各国CDC发布的指南中只提出了上呼吸道取样方法，并未提出推荐级别。因此，患者就诊时该选择怎样的取样方法、何种取样方法医护人员的安全性最高成为我们关注的问题。本文对近年来世界范围内流行的严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）、中东呼吸综合征（MERS）、甲型H1N1流感等传染性疾病相关上呼吸道取样方法研究共10篇文献进行了综述。从取样方法、取样时间、医护人员安全性3个维度整理了收集的文献，发现在所有上呼吸道取样方法中，鼻咽抽取物（NPA）在发病2周内具有较高的阳性率，鼻腔+口咽联合拭子（NS+OPS）对取样操作的医务人员危害最小。期望本综述能对此次疫情的防控提供一些参考。.
6268,[Possible unregistered SARS-CoV-2 infection in a young man with anosmia and ageusia].,"During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, testing of suspected cases in Denmark has recently been limited to those who were critically ill. This has left an increasing number of unregistered infections in the society, obscured quantification and impacted lived lives. This case story reports a possible mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthy young man in his twenties. Due to strategic guidelines, he was never tested for SARS-CoV-2, but the medical record was highly suspicious for infection. Besides the well-known symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, this case also reports total anosmia and ageusia."
