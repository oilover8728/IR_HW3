6070,"[Epidemiological aspects, clinic and control mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Situation in Spain].","In January 2020, the Chinese authorities confirmed the causative agent of an outbreak of cases with pneumonia of unknown etiology that appeared in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus of the coronavirus family. On March 12, the WHO declared this outbreak as a pandemic as it spread worldwide. Human epidemics usually follow the start of exponential growth, this means that from a small number of cases in a few days, a large increase in the number of infected people is observed. The clinical manifestations and spectrum of symptomatic disease range from moderate to critical presentations. In cases with fatal progression, the most serious complications sometimes are cause of a multi-organ failure and patient death. SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate, the route of transmission between humans is through the secretions of infected people, hands or contaminated objects. In general, the epidemic control measures used so far have been based on adoption of interventions from the classical epidemiology, identifying and isolating the cases, following the contacts and establishing restrictions, including quarantine, closure of educational centers, avoiding events in which crowds of people occur, limiting mobility. These measures have been effective in China, the original focus of the outbreak."
6071,"Dying from cancer with COVID-19: age, sex, socio-economic status, and comorbidities.","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused excess deaths (all causes) and has disproportionately affected the elderly with certain characteristics. Objectives: To study how COVID-19 affected cancer deaths regarding age, sex, socio-economic status, comorbidities, and access to palliative care. An additional objective was to study changes in place of care and death. Material and methods: A descriptive, retrospective study of all cancer patients who died during March-May 2020 in the Stockholm region, n = 1467 of which 278 died with a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with deaths in 2016-2019. The Stockholm Regional Council's central data warehouse was used. T-tests, 95% CI, Wilcoxon and chi-squared tests were used for comparisons. Results: There were excess cancer deaths compared with 2016-2019 (p < 0.001) and patients dying with a COVID-19 diagnosis were older (79.7 vs. 75.9 years, p < 0.0001), more often male (67% vs. 55%, p < 0.0001), and had more comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index 1.6 vs. 1.1, p < 0.0001). Patients with COVID-19 more seldom had access to palliative care (34% vs. 59%, p = 0.008), had more changes in place of care during the last two weeks of life (p < 0.0001) and died more often in acute hospitals (34% vs. 14%, p < 0.0001). For the subgroup with access to palliative care, the hospital deaths for individuals with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis were 11% and 4%, respectively (p = 0.008). Conclusion: Cancer patients dying with a COVID-19 diagnosis were older, more often male, and had more comorbidities. A COVID-19 diagnosis negatively affected the probability of being admitted to specialized palliative care and increased the likelihood of dying in an acute hospital."
6072,Classification of COVID-19 chest X-Ray and CT images using a type of dynamic CNN modification method.,"Understanding and classifying Chest X-Ray (CXR) and computerised tomography (CT) images are of great significance for COVID-19 diagnosis. The existing research on the classification for COVID-19 cases faces the challenges of data imbalance, insufficient generalisability, the lack of comparative study, etc. To address these problems, this paper proposes a type of modified MobileNet to classify COVID-19 CXR images and a modified ResNet architecture for CT image classification. In particular, a modification method of convolutional neural networks (CNN) is designed to solve the gradient vanishing problem and improve the classification performance through dynamically combining features in different layers of a CNN. The modified MobileNet is applied to the classification of COVID-19, Tuberculosis, viral pneumonia (with the exception of COVID-19), bacterial pneumonia and normal controls using CXR images. Also, the proposed modified ResNet is used for the classification of COVID-19, non-COVID-19 infections and normal controls using CT images. The results show that the proposed methods achieve 99.6% test accuracy on the five-category CXR image dataset and 99.3% test accuracy on the CT image dataset. Six advanced CNN architectures and two specific COVID-19 detection models, i.e., COVID-Net and COVIDNet-CT are used in comparative studies. Two benchmark datasets and a CXR image dataset which combines eight different CXR image sources are employed to evaluate the performance of the above models. The results show that the proposed methods outperform the comparative models in classification accuracy, sensitivity, and precision, which demonstrate their potential in computer-aided diagnosis for healthcare applications."

It can be achieved using several strategies, among which is the dendritic cell (DC) vaccine therapy. Several clinical trials are ongoing using DC vaccine therapy either as a sole agent or in combination with other interventions to tackle different types of cancer. Immunotherapy can offer a potential treatment to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) the worst pandemic facing this generation, a disease with deleterious effects on the health and economic systems worldwide. We hypothesize that DC vaccine therapy may provide a potential treatment strategy to help combat COVID-19. Cancer patients are at the top of the vulnerable population owing to their immune-compromised status. In this review, we discuss DC vaccine therapy in the light of the body's immunity, cancer, and newly emerging infections such as COVID-19 in hopes of better-customized treatment options for patients with multiple comorbidities."
6078,Video-mediated breaking bad news simulation.,"Background: Communication between clinicians, patients, and families is a core component of medical care that requires deliberate practice and feedback to improve. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sudden transformation in communication practices because of new physical distancing requirements, necessitating physicians to communicate bad news via telephone and video-mediated communication (VMC). This study investigated students' experience with a simulation-based communications training for having difficult conversations using VMC. Methods: Thirty-eight fourth-year medical students preparing for their surgical residency participated in a simulated scenario where students discussed a new COVID-19 diagnosis with a standardised family member (SFM) of a sick patient via VMC. Learners were introduced to an established communications model (SPIKES) by an educational video. After the simulation, SFM and course facilitators guided a debrief and provided feedback. Learners completed surveys evaluating reactions to the training, preparedness to deliver bad news, and attitudes about telehealth. Results: Twenty-three students completed evaluation surveys (response rate=61%). Few students had prior formal training (17%) or experience communicating bad news using telehealth (13%). Most respondents rated the session beneficial (96%) and felt they could express empathy using the VMC format (83%). However, only 57% felt ready to deliver bad news independently after the training and 52% reported it was more difficult to communicate without physical presence. Comments highlighted the need for additional practice. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrated the value and feasibility of teaching medical students to break bad news using VMC as well as demonstrating the need for additional training."
