2950,SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody titres after vaccination with BNT162b2 in naive and previously infected individuals.,"Great expectations are placed in vaccines against COVID-19 to control the pandemic. We reviewed the antibody titres in a cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs) vaccinated with BNT162b2 to assess the influence of a previous infection on them. We stratified the results according to the individual history of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and symptoms. Among 3475 HCWs the highest titres were recorded among those infected more than 6 months before vaccination, independently of symptoms, followed by those infected less than 6 months before vaccination, especially in those with symptoms, and by uninfected HCWs. Vaccination with BNT162b2 can boost immunity acquired through infection, particularly in those infected more than 6 months before vaccination."
2951,Real-time PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection in Canadian laboratories.,"With emergence of pandemic COVID-19, rapid and accurate diagnostic testing is essential. This study compared laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Canadian hospital and public health laboratories, and some commercially available real-time RT-PCR assays. Overall, analytical sensitivities were equivalent between LDTs and most commercially available methods."

2954,Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of nine commercial RT-PCR kits for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia.,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has led to the design and development of multiple reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction kits aimed to facilitate the rapid scale-up of molecular testing for massive screening. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of nine commercial kits, which showed optimal performance and high discriminatory power. However, we observed differences in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and E gene Ct Values and discuss these results in light of the influence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variability and its potential impact in current molecular diagnostic assays."
2955,A surrogate virus neutralization test to quantify antibody-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in finger stick dried blood spot samples.,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter host cells, and neutralizing antibodies are effective at blocking this interaction to prevent infection. Widespread application of this important marker of protective immunity is limited by logistical and technical challenges associated with live virus methods and venous blood collection. To address this gap, we validated an immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction in a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected on filter paper as a dried blood spot (DBS) sample. Samples are eluted overnight and incubated in the presence of spike antigen and ACE2 in a 96-well solid phase plate. Competitive immunoassay with electrochemiluminescent label is used to quantify neutralizing activity. The following measures of assay performance were evaluated: dilution series of confirmed positive and negative samples, agreement with results from matched DBS-serum samples, analysis of results from DBS samples with known COVID-19 status, and precision (intra-assay percent coefficient of variation; %CV) and reliability (inter-assay; %CV). Dilution series produced the expected pattern of dose-response. Agreement between results from serum and DBS samples was high, with concordance correlation = 0.991. Analysis of three control samples across the measurement range indicated acceptable levels of precision and reliability. Median % surrogate neutralization was 46.9 for PCR confirmed convalescent COVID-19 samples and 0.1 for negative samples. Large-scale testing is important for quantifying neutralizing antibodies that can provide protection against COVID-19 in order to estimate the level of immunity in the general population. DBS provides a minimally-invasive, low cost alternative to venous blood collection, and this scalable immunoassay-based method for quantifying inhibition of the spike-ACE2 interaction can be used as a surrogate for virus-based assays to expand testing across a wide range of settings and populations."

At least 649 coronavirus disease 2019 cases were identified, including secondary and tertiary spread to close contacts. To limit transmission, persons attending events should be vaccinated or wear masks and practice physical distancing if unvaccinated. Persons with a known exposure should be managed according to their coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination or prior infection status and may include quarantine and coronavirus disease 2019 testing."
2958,COVID-19 vaccines: A perspective from social pharmacology.,"Social pharmacology is a branch of clinical pharmacology, which depicts relationships between society and drugs and in particular factors, reasons, social consequences of drug use as well as representations of drugs in the society. Recent development and marketing of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines raises a number of questions of social pharmacology: are vaccines drugs like any other? What is their perception at the individual, population and societal levels? How do individuals perceive the risks and benefits of these vaccines? What is the perception at the societal level? What is the individual and societal acceptability of these vaccines during a pandemic? All these questions are discussed in the light of recent data. A number of proposals, both at the individual and at the collective or population level, are formulated to help solve these problems of social pharmacology."
