5490,"Nursing students' attitudes, knowledge and willingness of to receive the coronavirus disease vaccine: A cross-sectional study.","Aim: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and willingness of nursing students to receive the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine and the influencing factors. Background: Vaccination is one of the most effective measures to prevent COVID-19, but the vaccination acceptance rate varies across countries and populations. As trustworthy healthcare providers, nursing students' attitudes, knowledge and willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine may greatly affect the present and future vaccine acceptance rates of the population; however, studies related to the vaccine acceptance rates among nursing students are limited. Methods: A convenience sampling method was adopted to select two medical universities in China. Following the cluster sampling method, nursing college students who were eligible for the study were selected. A cross-sectional survey was conducted by asking nursing students to complete an online questionnaire from February to April 2021. Descriptive statistics, t-tests/one-way analysis of variance (normal distribution), U tests/H tests (skewness distribution) and multivariate linear regression were performed. Results: A total of 1488 valid questionnaires were collected. The score rates of the attitude, knowledge and vaccination willingness dimensions were 70.07%, 80.70% and 84.38%, respectively. Attitude was significantly influenced by vaccination status of family members. The main factors influencing knowledge were gender, grade and academic background. In terms of willingness, gender, academic background, visits to high-risk areas, vaccination status of family members and the side effects experienced after receiving other vaccines were significant influencing factors. Conclusions: Nursing students showed satisfactory vaccine acceptance rates. However, more attention should be paid to male students, younger students, those with a medical background, those with low grades and those whose family members had not received the COVID-19 vaccine or had side effects from the vaccine."
5491,Large-Sized Graphene Oxide Nanosheets Increase DC-T-Cell Synaptic Contact and the Efficacy of DC Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.,"Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are used for cancer and infectious diseases, albeit with limited efficacy. Modulating the formation of DC-T-cell synapses may greatly increase their efficacy. The effects of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on DCs and DC-T-cell synapse formation are evaluated. In particular, size-dependent interactions are observed between GO nanosheets and DCs. GOs with diameters of >1 µm (L-GOs) demonstrate strong adherence to the DC surface, inducing cytoskeletal reorganization via the RhoA-ROCK-MLC pathway, while relatively small GOs (≈500 nm) are predominantly internalized by DCs. Furthermore, L-GO treatment enhances DC-T-cell synapse formation via cytoskeleton-dependent membrane positioning of integrin ICAM-1. L-GO acts as a ""nanozipper,"" facilitating the aggregation of DC-T-cell clusters to produce a stable microenvironment for T cell activation. Importantly, L-GO-adjuvanted DCs promote robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike 1, leading to >99.7% viral RNA clearance in mice infected with a clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain. These findings highlight the potential value of nanomaterials as DC vaccine adjuvants for modulating DC-T-cell synapse formation and provide a basis for the development of effective COVID-19 vaccines."
5492,The Case for S2: The Potential Benefits of the S2 Subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein as an Immunogen in Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, it is imperative to learn more about antibodies and T-cells produced against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, in order to guide the rapid development of therapies and vaccines. While much of the current antibody and vaccine research focuses on the receptor-binding domain of S1, a less-recognized opportunity is to harness the potential benefits of the more conserved S2 subunit. Similarities between the spike proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 warrant exploring S2. Possible benefits of employing S2 in therapies and vaccines include the structural conservation of S2, extant cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in populations (due to prior exposure to common cold coronaviruses), the steric neutralization potential of antibodies against S2, and the stronger memory B-cell and T-cell responses. More research is necessary on the effect of glycans on the accessibility and stability of S2, SARS-CoV-2 mutants that may affect infectivity, the neutralization potential of antibodies produced by memory B-cells, cross-reactive T-cell responses, antibody-dependent enhancement, and antigen competition. This perspective aims to highlight the evidence for the potential advantages of using S2 as a target of therapy or vaccine design."
5493,Clinical evaluation of serological IgG antibody response on the Abbott Architect for established SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Residual sera from 177 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and 163 non-COVID-19 patients were tested for antibody with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott Diagnostics, Chicago, USA). Clinical records for COVID-19 patients were reviewed to determine the time from onset of clinical illness to testing. Results: Specificity of the assay was 100.0% (95%CI: 97.1-100.0%). The clinical sensitivity of the assay varied depending on time from onset of symptoms, increasing with longer periods from the onset of clinical illness. The clinical sensitivity at ≤6 days was 8.6% (7/81; 95%CI: 3.8-17.5%), at 7-13 days 43.6% (17/39; 95%CI: 28.2-60.2%), at 14-20 days 84.0% (21/25; 95%CI: 63.1-94.7%), and at ≥21 days 84.4% (27/32; 95%CI: 66.5-94.1%). Clinical sensitivity was higher in the ≥14-day group compared to <14 days. There were no differences between the 14-20-day and ≥21-days groups; the combined clinical sensitivity for these groups (≥14 days) was 84.2% (49/57; 71.6-92.1%). Conclusion: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test has high specificity. Clinical sensitivity was limited in the early stages of disease but improved from 14 days after the onset of clinical symptoms."
5494,Sample pooling is efficient in PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2: a study in 7400 healthcare professionals.,"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic shows the importance of having efficient virus diagnosis, especially in groups of particular relevance such as health care professionals, without involving a large economic expense. This is a prevalence study carried out in 7400 health care professionals in a 1350-bed hospital in Madrid, Spain. Pools of 10 samples were performed, using the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test for the diagnosis from clinical samples of nasopharyngeal exudate. A previous study was performed to evaluate the effect of the dilution in terms of sensitivity. The estimated sensitivity was over 95%. A total of 740 pools were performed, with a final result of 218 health care professionals being positive. Using the pooling system, the reagent cost reduction to the institution was 75.3%. It can be concluded that the described sample pooling system is a useful and efficient tool in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in certain groups, assuming a cost reduction without reducing the sensitivity."
5495,Risk of mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1: matched cohort study.,"Objective: To establish whether there is any change in mortality from infection with a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, designated a variant of concern (VOC-202012/1) in December 2020, compared with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Design: Matched cohort study. Setting: Community based (pillar 2) covid-19 testing centres in the UK using the TaqPath assay (a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection). Participants: 54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pillar 2 between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021, followed-up until 12 February 2021. Participants were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimens, and differed only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay. Main outcome measure: Death within 28 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Results: The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 per 1000 detected cases. Conclusions: The probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 is high. If this finding is generalisable to other populations, infection with VOC-202012/1 has the potential to cause substantial additional mortality compared with previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning and national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2."
5496,Laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 in China: A review of challenging cases and analysis.,"Since the initial emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, a rapid spread of the disease occurred around the world, rising to become an international global health concern at pandemic level. In the face of this medical challenge threatening humans, the development of rapid and accurate methods for early screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 became crucial to containing the emerging public health threat, and prevent further spread within the population. Despite the large number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China, some problematic cases with inconsistent laboratory testing results, were reported. Specifically, a high false-negative rate of 41% on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays was observed in China. Although serological testing has been applied worldwide as a complementary method to help identify SARS-CoV-2, several limitations on its use have been reported in China. Therefore, the use of both qRT-PCR and serological testing in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in China and elsewhere, presented considerable challenges, but when used in combination, can be valuable tools in the fight against COVID-19. In this review, we give an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of different molecular techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection that are currently used in several labs, including qRT-PCR, gene sequencing, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), nucleic acid mass spectrometry (MS), and gene editing technique based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas13) system. Then we mainly review and analyze some causes of false-negative qRT-PCR results, and how to resolve some of the diagnostic dilemma."
5497,Efficacy of a novel SARS-CoV-2 detection kit without RNA extraction and purification.,"Rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and preventing the spread of the virus. A novel detection kit - the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit (nCoV-DK) - halves the detection time by eliminating the steps of RNA extraction and purification. We evaluated the concordance between the nCoV-DK and direct PCR. The virus was detected in 53/71 specimens (74.6%) by direct PCR and in 55/71 specimens (77.5%) by nCoV-DK; the overall concordance rate was 94.4%: 95.2% for nasopharyngeal swab, 95.5% for saliva, and 85.7% for sputum. The nCoV-DK test effectively detects SARS-CoV-2 in all types of sample including saliva, while reducing the time required for detection, labor, and the risk of human error."

5499,Safety of elective abdominal and vascular surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective single-center study.,"Background: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who undergo surgery have impaired postoperative outcomes and increased mortality. Consequently, elective and semi-urgent operations on the increasing number of patients severely affected by COVID-19 have been indefinitely postponed.in many countries with unclear implications on disease progression and overall survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the establishment of a standardized screening program for acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sufficient to ensure high-quality medical and surgical treatment of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients while minimizing in-hospital SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methods: The screening program comprised polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs and a standardized questionnaire about potential symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All elective and emergency patients admitted to the surgical department of a tertiary-care hospital center in Lower Franconia, Germany, between March and May 2020 were included and their characteristics were recorded. Results: Out of the study population (n = 657), 509 patients (77.5%) had at least one risk factor for a potentially severe course of COVID-19 and 164 patients (25%) were active smokers. The average 7-day incidence in Lower Franconia was 24.0/100,000 during the observation period. Preoperative PCR testing revealed four asymptomatic positive patients out of the 657 tested patients. No postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection or transmission could be detected. Conclusion: The implementation of a standardized preoperative screening program to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients can ensure high-quality surgical care while minimizing infection risk for healthcare workers and potential in-hospital transmission."
