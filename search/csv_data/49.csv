480,Enhanced throughput of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time RT-PCR panel by assay multiplexing and specimen pooling.,"A multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was developed based on the same primer and probe sequences of an existing U.S. CDC Emergency Use authorized test panel, targeting SARS-CoV-2 N1, N2 and human RNase P genes in singleplex. Both singleplex and multiplex assays demonstrated linear dynamic ranges of 8 orders of magnitude and analytical limits of detection of 5 RNA transcript copies/reaction. Both assays showed 100 % agreement with 364 previously characterized clinical specimens (146 positive and 218 negative) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. To further increase testing throughput, 40 positive and 20 negative four-specimen pools were tested by the multiplex assay and showed 97.75 % and 100 % congruence with individual specimen tests, respectively. rRT-PCR assay multiplexing and sample pooling, individually or in combination, can substantially increase throughput of SARS-CoV-2 testing."
481,Validation of saliva sampling as an alternative to oro-nasopharyngeal swab for detection of SARS-CoV-2 using unextracted rRT-PCR with the Allplex 2019-nCoV assay.,"Introduction. The current severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has stressed the global supply chain for specialized equipment, including flocked swabs.Hypothesis. Saliva could be a potential alternative specimen source for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).Aim. To compare the detection efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva and oro-nasopharyngeal swab (ONPS) specimens.Methodology. Patients recruited from hospital provided paired saliva and ONPS specimens. We performed manual or automated RT-PCR with prior proteinase K treatment without RNA extraction using the Seegene Allplex 2019 nCoV assay.Results. Of the 773 specimen pairs, 165 (21.3 %) had at least one positive sample. Additionally, 138 specimens tested positive by both sampling methods. Fifteen and 12 cases were detected only by nasopharyngeal swab and saliva, respectively. The sensitivity of ONPS (153/165; 92.7 %; 95 % CI: 88.8-96.7) was similar to that of saliva (150/165; 90.9 %; 95 % CI: 86.5-95.3; P=0.5). In patients with symptoms for ≤ 10 days, the sensitivity of ONPS (118/126; 93.7 %; 95 % CI: 89.4-97.9) was similar to that of saliva (122/126; 96.8 %; 95 % CI: 93.8-99.9 %; P=0.9). However, the sensitivity of ONPS (20/22; 95.2 %; 95 % CI: 86.1-100) was higher than that of saliva (16/22; 71.4 %; 95 % CI: 52.1-90.8) in patients with symptoms for more than 10 days.Conclusions. Saliva sampling is an acceptable alternative to ONPS for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic individuals displaying symptoms for ≤ 10 days. These results reinforce the need to expand the use of saliva samples, which are self-collected and do not require swabs."
482,Implementation of an in-house real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay for the rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant.,"Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been associated with the occurrence since summer 2020 of several viral variants that overlapped or succeeded each other in time. Those of current concern harbor mutations within the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that may be associated with viral escape to immune responses. In our geographical area a viral variant we named Marseille-4 harbors a S477 N substitution in this RBD. Materials and methods: We aimed to implement an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay with a hydrolysis probe that specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant. Results: All 6 cDNA samples from Marseille-4 variant strains identified in our institute by genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR, whereas all 32 cDNA samples from other variants tested negative. In addition, 39/42 (93 %) respiratory samples identified by NGS as containing a Marseille-4 variant strain and 0/26 samples identified as containing non-Marseille-4 variant strains were positive. Finally, 2018/3960 (51%) patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed in our institute, 10/277 (3.6 %) respiratory samples collected in Algeria, and none of 207 respiratory samples collected in Senegal, Morocco, or Lebanon tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR. Discussion: Our in-house qPCR system was found reliable to detect specifically the Marseille-4 variant and allowed estimating it is involved in about half of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since December 2020. Such approach allows the real-time surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is warranted to monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical characterics based on comprehensive sets of data."
483,Analytic comparison between three high-throughput commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays reveals minor discrepancies in a high-incidence population.,"Performance of three automated commercial serological IgG-based assays was investigated for assessing SARS-CoV-2 ""ever"" (past or current) infection in a population-based sample in a high exposure setting. PCR and serological testing was performed on 394 individuals. SARS-CoV-2-IgG seroprevalence was 42.9% (95% CI 38.1-47.8%), 40.6% (95% CI 35.9-45.5%), and 42.4% (95% CI 37.6-47.3%) using the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively. Between the three assays, overall, positive, and negative percent agreements ranged between 93.2-95.7%, 89.3-92.8%, and 93.8-97.8%, respectively; Cohen's kappa statistic ranged from 0.86 to 0.91; and 35 specimens (8.9%) showed discordant results. Among all individuals, 12.5% (95% CI 9.6-16.1%) had current infection, as assessed by PCR. Of these, only 34.7% (95% CI 22.9-48.7%) were seropositive by at least one assay. A total of 216 individuals (54.8%; 95% CI 49.9-59.7%) had evidence of ever infection using antibody testing and/or PCR during or prior to this study. Of these, only 78.2%, 74.1%, and 77.3% were seropositive in the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively. All three assays had comparable performance and excellent agreement, but missed at least 20% of individuals with past or current infection. Commercial antibody assays can substantially underestimate ever infection, more so when infection rates are high."
484,High concentrations of hypochlorous acid-based disinfectant in the environment reduced the load of SARS-CoV-2 in nucleic acid amplification testing.,"During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, chlorine-containing disinfectants have been widely used in nucleic acid amplification testing laboratories. Whether the use of disinfectants affect the results of viral nucleic acid amplification is unknown. We examined the impact of different hypochlorous acid (HOCl) concentrations on the quantitative results of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We also explored the mechanisms and models of action of chlorine-containing disinfectants that affected the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The results showed that different HOCl concentrations and different action times had an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 results. High concentrations of ambient HOCl have a greater impact than low concentrations, and this effect will increase with the extension of the action time and with the increase in ambient humidity. Compared with the enzymes or the extracted RNA required for RT-PCR, the impact of HOCl on the SARS-CoV-2 detection is more likely to be caused by damage to primers and probes in the PCR system. The false negative result still existed after changing the ambient disinfectant to ethanol but not peracetic acid. The use of HOCl in the environment will have an unpredictable impact on the nucleic acid test results of SARS-CoV-2. In order to reduce the possibility of false negative of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test and prevent the spread of epidemic disease, environmental disinfectants should be used at the beginning and end of the experiment rather than during the experimental operation."
485,"Development and Validation of a Multiplex Microsphere Immunoassay Using Dried Blood Spots for SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence: Application in First Responders in Colorado, USA.","Serological testing of large representative populations for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is needed to estimate seroprevalence, transmission dynamics, and the duration of antibody responses from natural infection and vaccination. In this study, a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) was developed for the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) that was more sensitive than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (98% versus 87%). The MMIA was then applied and validated in 264 first responders in Colorado using serum and dried blood spot (DBS) eluates, compared to ELISA, and evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. Four percent (11/264) of first responders were seropositive in July to August 2020. Serum and DBS were highly correlated for anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies (R = 0.83, P < 0.0001 and R = 0.87, P < 0.0001, respectively) by MMIA. The MMIA accurately predicted SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using DBS (R = 0.76, P = 0.037). On repeat antibody testing 3 months later, anti-RBD IgG decreased less rapidly than anti-N IgG measured by MMIA, with a median change in geometric median fluorescence intensity of 62% versus 79% (P < 0.01) for anti-RBD and anti-N IgG, respectively. This novel MMIA using DBS could be scalable for rapid and affordable SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance in the United States and globally."
486,"[A proposal for the management of health surveillance and monitoring procedures in relation to the risks posed by SARS-COV-2 to hospital and nursing home workers, based on strategies implemented in the facilities of the Fondazione Opera San Camillo].","This paper describes how the health surveillance protocols adopted in hospitals and nursing homes have changed in response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its risks. These changes concern assessments that must be performed with urgency, to detect potential cases and symptoms that may indicate contagion and to protect vulnerable and hypersensitive workers. Besides, these changes have been implemented in order to regulate how the appointed occupational physician should perform everyday tasks, particularly in regard to preventive visits, periodic visits, office visits, and visits meant to authorize one's return to the workplace. This paper recommends that both preventive visits and periodic visits should include rapid antigen swab tests to screen for SARS-CoV-2 (which, if positive, should be confirmed by molecular tests) and serologic tests to detect IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Since this phase involves great risks for healthcare facilities, this paper proposes that swab testing should be performed every month and that serologic testing should be performed every three months (depending on whether the first test detects the presence of IgG antibodies). By combining antigen and molecular swab tests, healthcare professionals can diagnose workers with SARS-CoV-2 and identify positive asymptomatic cases. Because of its costs and its long turnaround times for results, molecular swab testing is recommended only when one needs to confirm a positive antigen swab test result. Serologic testing should be used alongside swab testing, to acquire data concerning the immunity of workers."
487,"Rapid Test Ag 2019-nCoV (PROGNOSIS, BIOTECH, Larissa, Greece); Performance Evaluation in Hospital Setting with Real Time RT-PCR.","Introduction: Rapid antigen tests (RATs) are convenient for SARS-CoV-2 detection because they are simpler and faster than nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). This study aimed to assess the accuracy of a locally manufactured test; Rapid Test Ag 2019-nCoV (PROGNOSIS, BIOTECH, Larissa, Greece) in a clinical setting and during mass screening. Methods: Nasopharyngeal samples from 624 individuals were analyzed. The results of the rapid test were compared to real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). At the end of the test's procedure, positive test strips were scanned in an S-Flow reader in order to roughly estimate the antigen concentration. Results: The lower limit of detection of the test was 468.75 genome copies/mL. The PROGNOSIS rapid test displayed a sensitivity of 85.5% (141/165) (95%CI: 79.1-90.5) and a specificity of 99.8% (458/459) (95%CI: 98.8-100.0%). The general inter-rater agreement was 0.89 (95%CI: 85.1-93.3). The regression analysis between the S-flow reader measurements (viral antigen) and the viral load of the positive samples demonstrated a weak correlation (R2 = 0.288, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The Rapid Test Ag 2019-nCoV demonstrated sufficient sensitivity, excellent specificity and could be available to be used with low overall cost. Thus, it could be used as point of care test, but also for mass screening for rapid detection of infected persons (e.g., for travelers)."
488,"Performance Evaluation of Real-Time RT-PCR Assays for the Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Developed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan.","Soon after the 2019 outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China, a protocol for real-time RT-PCR assay detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was established by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. The protocol used Charité's nucleocapsid (Sarbeco-N) and NIID nucleocapsid (NIID-N2) assays. During the following months, SARS-CoV-2 spread and caused a global pandemic, and various SARS-CoV-2 sequences were registered in public databases, such as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). In this study, we evaluated the S2 assay (NIID-S2) that was newly developed to replace the Sarbeco-N assay and the performance of the NIID-N2 and NIID-S2 assays, referring to mismatches in the primer/probe targeted region. We found that the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the NIID-S2 set were comparable to those of the NIID-N2 assay, and the detection rate for clinical specimens was identical to that of the NIID-N2 assay. Furthermore, among the available sequences (approximately 192,000), the NIID-N2 and NIID-S2 sets had 2.6% and 1.2% mismatched sequences, respectively, although most of these mismatches did not affect the amplification efficiency, except the 3' end of the NIID-N2 forward primer. These findings indicate that the previously developed NIID-N2 assay is suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with support from the newly developed NIID-S2 set."
489,Diagnostic performance of the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay in the clinical routine of a tertiary care hospital: Preliminary results from a single-center evaluation.,"Background: This report describes a manufacturer-independent evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay from Roche Diagnostics in a tertiary care setting. Methods: In this single-center study, we used nasopharyngeal swabs from 403 cases from the emergency department and intensive care unit of our hospital. The reference standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 was the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for positive RT-PCR assays. The index test was the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay. This electrochemiluminescence immunoassay produces results as cutoff index (COI) values, with values ≥1.00 being reported as positive. Results: Of the 403 cases, 47 showed positive results in RT-PCR assays. Of the 47 RT-PCR-positive cases, 12 showed positive results in the antigen assay. Of the 356 RT-PCR-negative cases, all showed negative results in the antigen assay. Thus, the antigen assay showed a sensitivity of 26% (95% CI, 14%-40%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%). Analysis of the relationship between Ct values and COI values in the 47 RT-PCR-positive cases showed a correlation coefficient of -0.704 (95% CI, -0.824 to -0.522). The true-positive rate of the antigen assay for Ct values of 15-24.9, 25-29.9, 30-34.9, and 35-39.9 was 100%, 44%, 8%, and 6%, respectively. Conclusions: The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay has a low sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Hence, we decided to not use this assay in the clinical routine of our hospital."
