8040,COVID-19 in a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient treated with alemtuzumab: Insight to the immune response after COVID.,"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel disease that has spread abruptly over the world, allowing the development of countermeasures an urgent global priority. It has been speculated that elder people and patient with comorbidities may be at risk of developing complication. On the other hand, it has been seen that immunosuppressed patients could develop a mild presentation of the disease. Based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressant agents are currently being tested as potential treatment for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: report a patient treated with alemtuzumab (Humanized monoclonal antibody against the lymphocyte and monocyte surface antigen CD52, which depletes B and T cells) (Thompson et al., 2018) for recurrent remittent multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who developed mild COVID-19. Results: Despite complete B and T cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days with no need for hospitalization due to COVID-19 and no clinical evidence of disease activation regarding her MS. Discussion: This report shows that MS patients with mild depletion of B and T cells can mount an antiviral response against COVID-19 and produce IgG."
8041,App-based symptom tracking to optimize SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy using machine learning.,"Background: Tests are scarce resources, especially in low and middle-income countries, and the optimization of testing programs during a pandemic is critical for the effectiveness of the disease control. Hence, we aim to use the combination of symptoms to build a predictive model as a screening tool to identify people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be prioritized for testing. Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals registered in ""Dados do Bem,"" a Brazilian app-based symptom tracker. We applied machine learning techniques and provided a SARS-CoV-2 infection risk map of Rio de Janeiro city. Results: From April 28 to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms through the app. Of these, 49,721 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, being 5,888 (11.8%) positive. Among self-reported symptoms, loss of smell (OR[95%CI]: 4.6 [4.4-4.9]), fever (2.6 [2.5-2.8]), and shortness of breath (2.1 [1.6-2.7]) were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our final model obtained a competitive performance, with only 7% of false-negative users predicted as negatives (NPV = 0.93). The model was incorporated by the ""Dados do Bem"" app aiming to prioritize users for testing. We developed an external validation in the city of Rio de Janeiro. We found that the proportion of positive results increased significantly from 14.9% (before using our model) to 18.1% (after the model). Conclusions: Our results showed that the combination of symptoms might predict SARS-Cov-2 infection and, therefore, can be used as a tool by decision-makers to refine testing and disease control strategies."
8042,Toll-like Receptor-4 (TLR4) Agonist-Based Intranasal Nanovaccine Delivery System for Inducing Systemic and Mucosal Immunity.,"Eliciting a robust immune response at mucosal sites is critical in preventing the entry of mucosal pathogens such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This task is challenging to achieve without the inclusion of a strong and safe mucosal adjuvant. Previously, inulin acetate (InAc), a plant-based polymer, is shown to activate toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and elicit a robust systemic immune response as a vaccine adjuvant. This study investigates the potential of nanoparticles prepared with InAc (InAc-NPs) as an intranasal vaccine delivery system to generate both mucosal and systemic immune responses. InAc-NPs (∼250 nm in diameter) activated wild-type (WT) macrophages but failed to activate macrophages from TLR4 knockout mice or WT macrophages when pretreated with a TLR4 antagonist (lipopolysaccharide-RS (LPS-RS)), which indicates the selective nature of a InAc-based nanodelivery system as a TLR4 agonist. Intranasal immunization using antigen-loaded InAc-NPs generated ∼65-fold and 19-fold higher serum IgG1 and IgG2a titers against the antigen, respectively, as compared to PLGA-NPs as a delivery system. InAc-NPs have also stimulated the secretion of sIgA at various mucosal sites, including nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALTs), lungs, and intestine, and produced a strong memory response indicative of both humoral and cellular immune activation. Overall, by stimulating both systemic and mucosal immunity, InAc-NPs laid a basis for a potential intranasal delivery system for mucosal vaccination."

8044,Maternal and Infant Outcomes Associated with Maternity Practices Related to COVID-19: The COVID Mothers Study.,"Background: Maternity care practices such as skin-to-skin care, rooming-in, and direct breastfeeding are recommended, but it is unclear if these practices increase the risk of clinically significant COVID-19 in newborns, and if disruption of these practices adversely affects breastfeeding. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 357 mothers and their infants <12 months who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Subjects came from an anonymous worldwide online survey between May 4 and September 30, 2020, who were recruited through social media, support groups, and health care providers. Using multivariable logistic regression, Fisher's exact test, and summary statistics, we assessed the association of skin-to-skin care, feeding, and rooming-in with SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, breastfeeding outcomes, and maternal distress. Results: Responses came from 31 countries. Among SARS-CoV-2+ mothers whose infection was ≤3 days of birth, 7.4% of their infants tested positive. We found a nonsignificant decrease in risk of hospitalization among neonates who roomed-in, directly breastfed, or experienced uninterrupted skin-to-skin care (p > 0.2 for each). Infants who did not directly breastfeed, experience skin-to-skin care, or who did not room-in within arms' reach, were significantly less likely to be exclusively breastfed in the first 3 months, adjusting for maternal symptoms (p ≤ 0.02 for each). Nearly 60% of mothers who experienced separation reported feeling ""very distressed,"" and 29% who tried to breastfeed were unable. Presence of maternal symptoms predicted infant transmission or symptoms (adjusted odds ratio = 4.50, 95% confidence interval = 1.52-13.26, p = 0.006). Conclusion: Disruption of evidence-based quality standards of maternity care is associated with harm and may be unnecessary."

8047,"Origin and genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 receptors, focusing on the gastrointestinal tract.","The emergence of coronavirus disease-2019 induced by a newly identified b-coronavirus, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has constituted a public health emergency. Even though it was considered a zoonotic disease, the virus has also spread among humans via respiratory secretions. The expression and distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) in various human organs might also show other possible infection routes. High ACE2 ribonucleic acid expression has been identified in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) indicating its importance as a possible infection pathway of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 induces viral entry into the host and most importantly has been found to be associated with the function of the gut. Its deficiency has been implicated in several pathologies such as colorectal inflammation. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an essential regulatory cascade operating both at a local tissue level and at the systemic or circulatory level. The RAS may be important in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease and is associated with the up-regulation of ACE2. Thus, the aim of this review is firstly, the analysis of some important general and genome characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and secondly, and most importantly, to focus on the utility of ACE2 receptors in both SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, especially in the GI tract."
8048,Deducing the N- and O-glycosylation profile of the spike protein of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"The current emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demands the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent rapid progress of mortalities. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high-resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor-binding domain of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O-glycosylation are strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research toward the development of a suitable vaccine candidate."
8049,COVID-19 and its effects on the digestive system.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection of the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with typical respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 invades not only the respiratory system, but also other organs expressing the cell surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2. In particular, the digestive system is a susceptible target of SARS-CoV-2. Gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and liver damage. Patients with digestive damage have a greater chance of progressing to severe or critical illness, a poorer prognosis, and a higher risk of death. This paper aims to summarize the digestive system symptoms of COVID-19 and discuss fecal-oral contagion of SARS-CoV-2. It also describes the characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and discusses precautions for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection during gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures. Improved attention to digestive system abnormalities and gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 patients may aid health care providers in the process of clinical diagnosis, treatment, and epidemic prevention and control."
