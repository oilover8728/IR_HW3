5530,BRAZILIAN IBD STUDY GROUP POSITION STATEMENT ON SARS-COV2 VACCINATION.,"Mass vaccination offers the best strategy to fight against COVID-19 pandemic, and SARS-CoV2 vaccines are being approved in several countries for emergency use. In Brazil, vaccine approval is expected in the next few days, however potential concerns exist regarding vaccine recommendations for specific populations, such as patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To address these questions, the Brazilian IBD Study Group (GEDIIB) provides this practical advice with key recommendations about the COVID-19 vaccines in IBD population."
5531,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Human Retinal Biopsies of Deceased COVID-19 Patients.,"Purpose: To report the presence of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human retina in deceased patients with confirmed novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients and methods: Fourteen eyes of 14 deceased patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease were enucleated during autopsy. A sample of human retina was secured and fixed in RNAlater™. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect three different viral RNA sequences (RdRp-gene, E-gene and Orf1 gene) of SARS-CoV-2. Results: In three out of 14 eyes SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in the retina of deceased COVID-19 patients. As analysis for three different sequences (RdRp-gene, E-gene and Orf1 gene) revealed positive results in RT-PCR, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in human retina is proven according to the standards of the World-Health-Organization. Conclusion: Viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in the retina of COVID-19 patients."
5532,"Perceived quarantine competence, attitudes and practices among the public during the coronavirus pandemic: A Saudi descriptive study.","Background: The unavailability of data on the long-term efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and of effective specific treatment, in addition to the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, makes nonpharmaceutical measures a mainstay for preventing the spread of infection. The policy responses of governments to the pandemic should be integrated with public behavioral changes. This study examines public attitudes, practices and perceived quarantine competency in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive design using an online survey was employed. Convenience and snowball sampling were adopted, and 1022 valid responses were received. Findings: Most respondents demonstrated satisfactory practices, including wearing face masks (76.5%), keeping a safe distance (97.8%) and appropriate hand hygiene (99.2%). Fear of stigma (8.9%) and of financial consequences (0%) were minimal drivers of underreporting of symptoms among the respondents, whereas uncertainty of the relevance of symptoms (30.3%) was a main cause of not reporting to health authorities. Most participants (73.4%) abided by government instructions due to fear of infection rather than of legal penalties. Participants, especially females and Saudi citizens, reported a high level of perceived quarantine competence (12.9 ± 2.59). Spearman's rho correlation showed a significant positive association between wearing face masks and other precautionary practices, including keeping a safe distance (0.25, P < .01) and frequent handwashing (0.224, P < .01), which rules out the concern that wearing face masks would result in less adherence of the participants to other protective measures. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 awareness programs should focus more on males and non-Saudi populations. We also recommend the development of screening protocols and education programs for asthmatic patients in Saudi Arabia to avoid the consequences of confusing COVID-19 symptoms with those of asthma."
5533,Ethical limits to placebo use and access to Covid-19 vaccines as a human right.,"The world is currently facing another severe pandemic, Covid-19, just four decades after the start of AIDS, and the still increasing incidence of HIV infection continues to be one of the greatest global health challenges. The way the latter was confronted is of fundamental importance for a serious discussion on global health, ethics and human rights, and this experience could and can still be applied to Covid-19. The Covid-19 pandemic has specific characteristics and these will be discussed, in relation to vaccine research and especially to the global right to equal access to products proven to be safe and effective. The article focusses primarily on issues related to Covid-19 vaccines, especially the appropriate use and limits on placebo, the right to post-trial access to placebo arm participants, and the use of an active control for subsequent Phase-3 trials after the approval of other safe and efficacious vaccines. Most importantly, it will emphasise that access to Covid-19 vaccines is a human right, which presupposes the establishment of appropriate ethical standards to ensure universal, equal, and affordable access to healthcare and to vaccines for all, and the imperative need for suspension of patents for products developed for Covid-19. It will consider the role of social determinants that contribute to the severity of Covid-19 and that must be addressed to effectively curb the current syndemic."
5534,"A Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Trial for Early Breast Cancer is Impacted by COVID-19: Addressing Vaccination and Cancer Trials Through Education, Equity, and Outcomes.","While COVID-19 vaccine distribution has addressed vulnerabilities related to age and comorbidities, there is a need to ensure vaccination of patients with cancer receiving experimental and routine treatment, where interruption of treatment by infection is likely to result in inferior outcomes. Among patients with cancer, those undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or adjuvant chemotherapy (Adj chemo) for early breast cancer (EBC) are at particularly high risk for inferior outcomes, in part, because optimal timing of chemotherapy is essential for promoting distant disease-free survival. COVID-19 data from the ongoing multicenter I-SPY 2 trial of NAC for EBC provides a window into the magnitude of the problem of treatment interruption, not only for the trial itself but also for routine Adj chemo. In the I-SPY 2 trial, 4.5% of patients had disruption of therapy by COVID-19, prior to wide vaccine availability, suggesting that nationally up to 5,700 patients with EBC were at risk for adverse outcomes from COVID-19 infection in 2020. To address this problem, vaccine education and public engagement are essential to overcome hesitancy, while equity of distribution is needed to address access. To accomplish these goals, healthcare organizations (HCO) need to not only call out disinformation but also engage the public with vaccine education and find common ground for vaccine acceptance, while partnering with state/local governments to improve efficiency of vaccine distribution. These approaches are important to improve trial access and to reduce susceptibility to COVID-19, as the pandemic could continue to impact access to clinical trials and routine cancer treatment."
5535,A combined approach of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and multivariate analysis as a potential tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal swabs.,"Coronavirus disease 2019, known as COVID-19, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The early, sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus is widely recognized as the critical point in responding to the ongoing outbreak. Currently, the diagnosis is based on molecular real time RT-PCR techniques, although their implementation is being threatened due to the extraordinary demand for supplies worldwide. That is why the development of alternative and / or complementary tests becomes so relevant. Here, we exploit the potential of mass spectrometry technology combined with machine learning algorithms, for the detection of COVID-19 positive and negative protein profiles directly from nasopharyngeal swabs samples. According to the preliminary results obtained, accuracy = 67.66 %, sensitivity = 61.76 %, specificity = 71.72 %, and although these parameters still need to be improved to be used as a screening technique, mass spectrometry-based methods coupled with multivariate analysis showed that it is an interesting tool that deserves to be explored as a complementary diagnostic approach due to the low cost and fast performance. However, further steps, such as the analysis of a large number of samples, should be taken in consideration to determine the applicability of the method developed."
5536,Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance for Community Transmitted COVID-19 in the Emergency Department.,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, manifests as a respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) and is the cause of an ongoing pandemic. The response to COVID-19 in the United States has been hampered by an overall lack of diagnostic testing capacity. To address uncertainty about ongoing levels of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission early in the pandemic, we aimed to develop a surveillance tool using readily available emergency department (ED) operations data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). This involved optimizing the identification of acute respiratory infection (ARI)-related encounters and then comparing metrics for these encounters before and after the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Methods: We performed an observational study using operational EHR data from two Midwest EDs with a combined annual census of over 80,000. Data were collected three weeks before and after the first confirmed case of local SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. To optimize capture of ARI cases, we compared various metrics including chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and ARI-related orders. Operational metrics for ARI cases, including volume, pathogen identification, and illness severity, were compared between the preand post-community transmission timeframes using chi-square tests of independence. Results: Compared to our combined definition of ARI, chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and isolation orders individually identified less than half of the cases. Respiratory pathogen testing was the top performing individual ARI definition but still only identified 72.2% of cases. From the pre to post periods, we observed significant increases in ED volumes due to ARI and ARI cases without identified pathogen. Conclusion: Certain methods for identifying ARI cases in the ED may be inadequate and multiple criteria should be used to optimize capture. In the absence of widely available SARS-CoV-2 testing, operational metrics for ARI-related encounters, especially the proportion of cases involving negative pathogen testing, are useful indicators for active surveillance of potential COVID-19 related ED visits."
5537,COVID-19 Vaccine Development to Vaccination.,"In the race for a safe and effective vaccine against Coronavirus disease-19 manufacturer plays a critical role throughout the development, clinical trial, manufacturing, supply, and vaccination phases. For the efficacy of Coronavirus disease-19 vaccine, proper transport, storage, vaccine carrier, adjuvant, dosage form and route of vaccine administration plays a crucial role for immune response. In the context of no more people were willing to pay for a Coronavirus disease-19 vaccine the logistics of manufacturing, storing and distributing the vaccine, and mass vaccination are essential. It is urgent to improve health promotion and reduce the barriers to Coronavirus disease-19 vaccination. Keywords: COVID-19; vaccine development; vaccination."
5538,Kinetics of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses 3 Months Post Complete Vaccination with BNT162b2; A Prospective Study in 283 Health Workers.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-S-RBD IgGs up to three months after the second vaccination dose with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. NAbs and anti-S-RBD levels were measured on days 1 (before the first vaccine shot), 8, 22 (before the second shot), 36, 50, and three months after the second vaccination (D111) (NCT04743388). 283 health workers were included in this study. NAbs showed a rapid increase from D8 to D36 at a constant rate of about 3% per day and reached a median (SD) of 97.2% (4.7) at D36. From D36 to D50, a slight decrease in NAbs values was detected and it became more prominent between D50 and D111 when the rate of decline was determined at -0.11 per day. The median (SD) NAbs value at D111 was 92.7% (11.8). A similar pattern was also observed for anti-S-RBD antibodies. Anti-S-RBDs showed a steeper increase during D22-D36 and a lower decline rate during D36-D111. Prior COVID-19 infection and younger age were associated with superior antibody responses over time. In conclusion, we found a persistent but declining anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity at 3 months following full vaccination with BNT162b2 in healthy individuals."
5539,"The emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic: Understanding the epidemiology, immune response and potential therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2.","An acute respiratory disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that surfaced in China in late 2019, continues to spread rapidly across the globe causing serious concerns. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is declared as a public health emergency worldwide by the World Health Organization (WHO). Increasing evidences have demonstrated human-to-human transmission that primarily affects the upper respiratory tract followed by lower respiratory tract damage leading to severe pneumonia. Based on the current status, the elderly population and people with prior co-morbidities are highly susceptible to serious health effects including cytokine up-regulation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Currently, COVID-19 research is still in the preliminary stage necessitating rigorous studies. There is no specific drug or vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2 currently and only symptomatic treatment is being administered, but several antivirals are under active investigation. In this review, we have summarized the epidemiology, entry mechanism, immune response, and therapeutic implications, possible drug targets, their ongoing clinical trials, and put forward vital questions to offer new directions to the COVID-19 research."
