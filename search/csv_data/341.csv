3400,Multiplex quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies based on DNA-assisted nanopore sensing.,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread into a global pandemic. Early and accurate diagnosis and quarantine remain the most effective mitigation strategy. Although reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, recent studies suggest that nucleic acids were undetectable in a significant number of cases with clinical features of COVID-19. Serologic assays that detect human antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 serve as a complementary method to diagnose these cases, as well as to identify asymptomatic cases and qualified convalescent serum donors. However, commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are laborious and non-quantitative, while point-of-care assays suffer from low detection accuracy. To provide a serologic assay with high performance and portability for potential point-of-care applications, we developed DNA-assisted nanopore sensing for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 related antibodies in human serum. Different DNA structures were used as detection reporters for multiplex quantification of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens from patients with conformed or suspected infection. Comparing to a clinically used point-of-care assay and an ELISA assay, our technology can reliably quantify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with higher accuracy, large dynamic range, and potential for assay automation."
3401,Pooled testing with replication as a mass testing strategy for the COVID-19 pandemics.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic it is essential to test as many people as possible, in order to detect early outbreaks of the infection. Present testing solutions are based on the extraction of RNA from patients using oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, and then testing with real-time PCR for the presence of specific RNA filaments identifying the virus. This approach is limited by the availability of reactants, trained technicians and laboratories. One of the ways to speed up the testing procedures is a group testing, where the swabs of multiple patients are grouped together and tested. In this paper we propose to use the group testing technique in conjunction with an advanced replication scheme in which each patient is allocated in two or more groups to reduce the total numbers of tests and to allow testing of even larger numbers of people. Under mild assumptions, a 13 Ã— average reduction of tests can be achieved compared to individual testing without delay in time."
3402,The challenges of containing SARS-CoV-2 via test-trace-and-isolate.,"Without a cure, vaccine, or proven long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2, test-trace-and-isolate (TTI) strategies present a promising tool to contain its spread. For any TTI strategy, however, mitigation is challenged by pre- and asymptomatic transmission, TTI-avoiders, and undetected spreaders, which strongly contribute to ""hidden"" infection chains. Here, we study a semi-analytical model and identify two tipping points between controlled and uncontrolled spread: (1) the behavior-driven reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the hidden chains becomes too large to be compensated by the TTI capabilities, and (2) the number of new infections exceeds the tracing capacity. Both trigger a self-accelerating spread. We investigate how these tipping points depend on challenges like limited cooperation, missing contacts, and imperfect isolation. Our results suggest that TTI alone is insufficient to contain an otherwise unhindered spread of SARS-CoV-2, implying that complementary measures like social distancing and improved hygiene remain necessary."
3403,Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using a reagent-free approach.,"Shortage of reagents and consumables required for the extraction and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory samples has led many laboratories to investigate alternative approaches for sample preparation. Many groups recently presented results using heat processing method of respiratory samples prior to RT-qPCR as an economical method enabling an extremely fast streamlining of the processes at virtually no cost. Here, we present our results using this method and highlight some major pitfalls that diagnostics laboratories should be aware of before proceeding with this methodology. We first investigated various treatments using different temperatures, incubation times and sample volumes to optimise the heat treatment conditions. Although the initial data confirmed results published elsewhere, further investigations revealed unexpected inhibitory properties of some commonly used universal transport media (UTMs) on some commercially available RT-qPCR mixes, leading to a risk of reporting false-negative results. This emphasises the critical importance of a thorough validation process to determine the most suitable reagents to use depending on the sample types to be tested. In conclusion, a heat processing method is effective with very consistent Ct values and a sensitivity of 96.2% when compared to a conventional RNA extraction method. It is also critical to include an internal control to check each sample for potential inhibition."
3404,Maternal and Child Outcomes Reported by Breastfeeding Women Following Messenger RNA COVID-19 Vaccination.,"Background: In December 2020, two novel messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; however, the early trials excluded lactating women. Methods: Breastfeeding women residing in the United States who received either of the two mRNA vaccines were enrolled into the Mommy's Milk Human Milk Research Biorepository at the University of California, San Diego. From December 14, 2020 to February 1, 2021, 180 women who received two doses of either mRNA vaccine were recruited into the study. Results: Similar proportions of women reported any one or more symptoms following vaccination with either mRNA vaccine. In addition, the frequency by specific type of symptom did not differ by brand. However, following the second dose of vaccine, women who received the Moderna brand were significantly more likely to report symptoms. A small proportion of women following the first dose of either vaccine brand reported a reduction in milk supply, and significantly, more women reported a reduction in milk supply following the second dose of Moderna. Few infant events were reported for either vaccine brand following either dose, and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: These data are reassuring regarding the safety of vaccination in breastfeeding women and their breastfed children with either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines."
3405,Twitter discourse reveals geographical and temporal variation in concerns about COVID-19 vaccines in the United States.,"The speed at which social media is propagating COVID-19 misinformation and its potential reach and impact is growing, yet little work has focused on the potential applications of these data for informing public health communication about COVID-19 vaccines. We used Twitter to access a random sample of over 78 million vaccine-related tweets posted between December 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021 to describe the geographical and temporal variation in COVID-19 vaccine discourse. Urban suburbs posted about equitable distribution in communities, college towns talked about in-clinic vaccinations near universities, evangelical hubs posted about operation warp speed and thanking God, exurbs posted about the 2020 election, Hispanic centers posted about concerns around food and water, and counties in the ACP African American South posted about issues of trust, hesitancy, and history. The graying America ACP community posted about the federal government's failures; rural middle American counties posted about news press conferences. Topics related to allergic and adverse reactions, misinformation around Bill Gates and China, and issues of trust among Black Americans in the healthcare system were more prevalent in December, topics related to questions about mask wearing, reaching herd immunity and natural infection, and concerns about nursing home residents and workers increased in January, and themes around access to black communities, waiting for appointments, keeping family safe by vaccinating and fighting online misinformation campaigns were more prevalent in February. Twitter discourse around COVID-19 vaccines in the United States varied significantly across different communities and changed over time; these insights could inform targeted messaging and mitigation strategies."
