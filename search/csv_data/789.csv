7880,Another front in COVID-19's perfect storm.,"In this issue of Blood, Althaus et al identify circulating procoagulant platelets as a novel biomarker of COVID-19 disease severity and present provocative in vitro findings demonstrating that antibodies induced in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can initiate procoagulant platelet formation."
7881,Is Vertical Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Possible in Preterm Triplet Pregnancy? A Case Series.,"There is limited data regarding the vertical transmission (VT) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection. We report the first case of VT in preterm triplet pregnancy, with all triplets positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 at 20 hours and day 5 of life. This report reiterates the need for an expedited formulation of a simple, standardized, and reproducible international case definition and classification for VT."
7882,A high-throughput neutralizing antibody assay for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine evaluation.,"Virus neutralization remains the gold standard for determining antibody efficacy. Therefore, a high-throughput assay to measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies is urgently needed for COVID-19 serodiagnosis, convalescent plasma therapy, and vaccine development. Here, we report on a fluorescence-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay that detects SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patient specimens and yields comparable results to plaque reduction neutralizing assay, the gold standard of serological testing. The fluorescence-based neutralization assay is specific to measure COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies without cross reacting with patient specimens with other viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections. Collectively, our approach offers a rapid platform that can be scaled to screen people for antibody protection from COVID-19, a key parameter necessary to safely reopen local communities."
7883,"Clinical review of cerebral venous thrombosis in the context of COVID-19 vaccinations: Evaluation, management, and scientific questions.","Background: Vaccine induced immune mediated thrombocytopenia or VITT, is a recent and rare phenomenon of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, frequently including cerebral venous thromboses (CVT), that has been described following vaccination with adenovirus vaccines ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2·S Johnson and Johnson (Janssen/J&J). The evaluation and management of suspected cases of CVT post COVID-19 vaccination are critical skills for a broad range of healthcare providers. Methods: A collaborative comprehensive review of literature was conducted among a global group of expert neurologists and hematologists. Findings: Strategies for rapid evaluation and treatment of the CVT in the context of possible VITT exist, including inflammatory marker measurements, PF4 assays, and non-heparin anticoagulation."
7884,Targeting the viral-entry facilitators of SARS-CoV-2 as a therapeutic strategy in COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, which has emerged as a global pandemic causing serious concerns. Lack of specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 is a major concern and the development of vaccines is another important aspect in managing the infection effectively. The first step in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is the viral entry and it is mediated by its densely glycosylated spike protein (S-protein). Similar to the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the host cell entry receptor. In addition to ACE2, several recent studies have implicated the crucial role of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) as a necessary assisting cofactor for ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was also identified to use both endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for the pivotal role of S-protein priming mediating viral entry. As the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is mandatory for viral infection, it becomes an extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point. In this regard, this review will focus on the therapeutic targeting of the crucial steps of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry like S-protein/ACE2 interaction and S-protein priming by host cell proteases. In addition, this review will also give insights to the readers on several therapeutic opportunities, pharmacological targeting of the viral-entry facilitators like S-Protein, ACE2, cell surface HS, TMPRSS2, and CatB/L and evidence for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies."

7887,Fulminant myocarditis and systemic hyperinflammation temporally associated with BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in two patients.,"Immune-mediated myocardial injury following Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirys-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection has been described in adults and children. Cases of myocarditis following immunization for SARS-CoV2 have recently been documented, mostly associated with mild severity and spontaneous recovery. We herein report two cases of fulminant myocarditis following BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccination associated with systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome and refractory shock requiring support with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation."

7889,Should qualitative RT-PCR be used to determine release from isolation of COVID-19 patients?,"•COVID-19 patients may have persistently positive RT-PCRs for as many as 9 weeks.•Some are being required to continue in isolation until they have negative results.•SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR does not distinguish infectious from noninfectious.•Quantitative RT-PCRs and immunoassays are better markers of infectivity period.•Social isolation can have economic, physical, psychological, and social effects."
