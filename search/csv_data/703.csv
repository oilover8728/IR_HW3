7021,Validation of an At-Home Direct Antigen Rapid Test for COVID-19.,This cohort study examines the performance of direct antigen rapid tests compared with that of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for analyzing self-collected nasal specimens for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.
7022,COVID-19 and the Consequences of Anchoring Bias.,"Suspicion of coronavirus disease in febrile patients might lead to anchoring bias, causing misdiagnosis of other infections for which epidemiologic risks are present. This bias has potentially severe consequences, illustrated by cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis and Lyme disease in a pregnant woman and human granulocytic anaplasmosis in another person."

7025,Comparison of seven commercial RT-PCR diagnostic kits for COVID-19.,"The final months of 2019 witnessed the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 % limit of detection (LOD95). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was ≥96 % for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories."

7027,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: Status Report.,"SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, first emerged in late 2019 in China. It has since infected more than 870,000 individuals and caused more than 43,000 deaths globally. Here, we discuss therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on vaccine development and its challenges. Vaccines are being rapidly developed but will likely come too late to affect the first wave of a potential pandemic. Nevertheless, critical lessons can be learned for the development of vaccines against rapidly emerging viruses. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be essential to reducing morbidity and mortality if the virus establishes itself in the population."
7028,COVID-19 in the light of current clinical eye research.,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by a SARS-CoV-2 virus infection first reported in Wuhan city, Chinese province of Hubei, in December 2019. Previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease, COVID-19 was declared official name by the World Health Organization (WHO) as COVID-19 in February 2020. By July 2nd, 2020 10,818,005 confirmed cases with 519,467 COVID-19 deaths worldwide. The aim of this review article is to inform the audience of what is available in the current literature on how COVID-19 affects the eyes in adults, children, and elderly. PubMed search was used between December 2019 and July 2nd, 2020. Randomized trials, observational studies, case series or case reports, and letters of research, letters to editors were selected for confirmed cases of COVID-19. According to current scientific literature since the outbreak in December 2019 there have been 218 papers written. Conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctvitis have been reported in adults with COVID-19. Further studies are needed in children and geriatric patients."
7029,Amplification-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 with CRISPR-Cas13a and mobile phone microscopy.,"The December 2019 outbreak of a novel respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, has become an ongoing global pandemic due in part to the challenge of identifying symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus. CRISPR diagnostics can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable, and accurate. Here, we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA that can be read with a mobile phone microscope. The assay achieved ∼100 copies/μL sensitivity in under 30 min of measurement time and accurately detected pre-extracted RNA from a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 min. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity and directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. Integrated with a reader device based on a mobile phone, this assay has the potential to enable rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening for SARS-CoV-2."
