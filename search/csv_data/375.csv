3740,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adolescents: An update on current clinical and diagnostic characteristics.,"The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is defined as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, fatigue, cough, breathing difficulty that may lead to respiratory distress; a small population of patients may have diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. The highest infection rate occurs in adults; however, neonates, children, and adolescents can also be infected. As the outbreak continues to spread worldwide, attention has switched toward determinants of clinical manifes- tations and disease severity. The situation surrounding the outbreak is rapidly evolving and the information and recommendations are changing as new information becomes available. This paper summarises the cur- rent findings (April 3,2020) from a systematic literature review on the current knowledge of COVID-19 in adolescents (10-19 years according to the WHO definition) and reports the preliminary epidemiological data stated by the Italian National Institute of Health."

3743,Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) in 12 Patients Treated for SARS-CoV-2 Positive Pneumonia.,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading throughout the world. The study describes 12 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who developed an acute erythematous rash with nonfollicular pinhead-sized pustules, without mucosal involvement. The clinical differential diagnosis was viral rash, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), or multiform erythema. computed tomography with a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia and a respiratory tract sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients had signs of respiratory distress and were treated with hydroxychloroquine, darunavir, ritonavir, heparin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Punch biopsies showed subcorneal pustules typical of AGEP. Dermal microvascular injury and thrombosis as described in skin damage by SARS-CoV-2 infection was not observed. The direct immunofluorescence for IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 was negative in 8 patients investigated. A polymerase chain reaction for RNA SARS-CoV-2 performed on frozen skin was negative in 5 of 6 patients. Most of our patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids. After some days (4-10), the diffuse erythema and pustules had improved. AGEP is classified as a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, provoked by drugs and acute infections. Characteristically, removal of the offending agent leads to spontaneous resolution typically in less than 15 days. The recognition of AGEP is important, in order to avoid confusion with a systemic infection and consequently to avoid incorrect treatment. Cutaneous adverse reactions to drugs are common and are major health problems worldwide causing considerable costs for health care systems. We suggest that in the patients with AGEP during SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, viral infection is a risk factor for developing drug reaction."
3744,mRNA-lipid nanoparticle COVID-19 vaccines: Structure and stability.,"A drawback of the current mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) COVID-19 vaccines is that they have to be stored at (ultra)low temperatures. Understanding the root cause of the instability of these vaccines may help to rationally improve mRNA-LNP product stability and thereby ease the temperature conditions for storage. In this review we discuss proposed structures of mRNA-LNPs, factors that impact mRNA-LNP stability and strategies to optimize mRNA-LNP product stability. Analysis of mRNA-LNP structures reveals that mRNA, the ionizable cationic lipid and water are present in the LNP core. The neutral helper lipids are mainly positioned in the outer, encapsulating, wall. mRNA hydrolysis is the determining factor for mRNA-LNP instability. It is currently unclear how water in the LNP core interacts with the mRNA and to what extent the degradation prone sites of mRNA are protected through a coat of ionizable cationic lipids. To improve the stability of mRNA-LNP vaccines, optimization of the mRNA nucleotide composition should be prioritized. Secondly, a better understanding of the milieu the mRNA is exposed to in the core of LNPs may help to rationalize adjustments to the LNP structure to preserve mRNA integrity. Moreover, drying techniques, such as lyophilization, are promising options still to be explored."

They prioritize most the public health's well-being, including the poor and the most vulnerable. Thus, authentic leaders can work through a public health crisis's maelstrom. Through service and inspiration, the community can help out, collaborate and find solutions to mitigate the ill-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic."
