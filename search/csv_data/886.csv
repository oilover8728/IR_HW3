8850,Impaired performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests at elevated and low temperatures.,"Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can complement molecular diagnostics for COVID-19. The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 2-30 °C. In the global South, mean temperatures can exceed 30 °C. In the global North, Ag-RDTs are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 °C or at 37 °C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0×106- 5.5×107 genome copies/mL of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 min pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37 °C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for five out of 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37 °C, eight of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture supernatant from common respiratory viruses was not affected by storage and testing at 37 °C, whereas false-positive results occurred at outside temperatures of 2-4 °C for two out of six tested Ag-RDTs, again including an Ag-RDT recommended by the WHO. In summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. Consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments. Storage and operation of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at recommended conditions is essential for successful usage during the pandemic."
8851,Azithromycin and SARS-CoV-2 infection: Where we are now and where we are going.,"•Azithromycin (AZM) is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of the COVID-19.•Studies so far on the use of AZM in COVID-19 patients have various methodological limitations.•The evidence on the efficacy of AZM as an adjunct to hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 is not enough yet.•Combination of AZM and HCQ should be decided with caution due serious cardiac adverse effects.•Currently, 21 clinical trials are being carried out on the use of AZM in COVID-19."
8852,"Prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) 3C-like protease (3CL (pro)) structure: virtual screening reveals velpatasvir, ledipasvir, and other drug repurposing candidates.","We prepared the three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 (aka 2019-nCoV) 3C-like protease (3CL pro) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96% identity) ortholog from the SARS-CoV. All residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. With the 3CL pro molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache. The drugs Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes."
8853,"Characteristics and Outcome of 69 Cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Lu'an City, China Between January and February 2020.","BACKGROUND This population study aimed to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcome of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in Lu'an City, China between January 22, 2020 and February 18, 2020 identified from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP). MATERIAL AND METHODS Laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in the CISDCP were included in this study. The distribution of cases, exposure history, clustered epidemic situation, and clinical manifestations, disease severity, and key time nodes were analyzed. Once the throat swab or sputum sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing as confirmed cases. RESULTS There were 69 cases of COVID-19 that were confirmed between January 22 and February 18, 2020 reported. The onset time was concentrated on January 25, 2020 solstice to February 6, 2020 (71.0%), and the reporting dates were concentrated on January 31, 2020 and February 9, 2020 (69.6%). Nineteen cases (27.5%) had a history of sojourn in Hubei Province, and none of the cases reported after February 6, 2020 had a history of exposure in Hubei Province. There were 14 cluster outbreaks, and human-to-human transmission was the most common (78.6%). The most common symptoms were fever (56.5%), cough (37.7%), and self-conscious discomfort (14.5%). Besides, there were 9 severe cases (13.0%). CONCLUSIONS The epidemic prevention and control in Lu'an City has achieved phased results. Yet, new strict control measures need to be implemented to prevent a further outbreak, especially for those who will return to Lu'an City."
8854,Emerging RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Mutation in a Remdesivir-Treated B-cell Immunodeficient Patient With Protracted Coronavirus Disease 2019.,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly discovered virus for which remdesivir is the only antiviral available. We report the occurrence of a mutation in RdRP (D484Y) following treatment with remdesivir in a 76-year-old female with post-rituximab B-cell immunodeficiency and persistent SARS-CoV-2 viremia. A cure was achieved after supplementation with convalescent plasma.
8855,[Florence Nightingale and the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic].,"Per la Sanità pubblica l'anno 2020 appena trascorso si può rappresentare con due avvenimenti: la grande pandemia da coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (così chiamato per la sua immagine circondata da ""spine"") e il bicentenario della nascita di Florence Nightingale (così chiamata perché nata a Firenze il 12 maggio 1820). L'abbinamento di questi due avvenimenti è meno lontano di quanto sembri prestandosi ad alcune istruttive considerazioni."
8856,Treatment concerns for bullous pemphigoid in the COVID-19 pandemic era.,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune blistering disease with subepidermal involvement, typically affecting the elderly. It has spontaneous remissions and exacerbations with significant morbidity. A novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the new universal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The pandemic made concerns, especially about immunosuppressive therapy. In this article, we reviewed the management of BP in the COVID-19 pandemic era. The data about the best management of autoimmune bullous diseases like BP, during the outbreak of COVID-19, are evolving and updated every day."
8857,Dynamic tracking of variant frequencies depicts the evolution of mutation sites amongst SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India.,"With the exponential spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic across the world within the 12 months, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains are continuously trying to adapt themselves to the host environment by random mutations. When doing so, some variants with evolutionary advantages such as better human to human transmissibility potential might get naturally selected. This short communication demonstrates how the mutation frequency patterns are evolving in 2457 SAR-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified 19 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of 7 months. Out of these, 14 variants are showing increasing mutational probabilities suggesting their propagation with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. However, the mutational probabilities of five variants have significantly decreased in June onward as compared to March/April, suggesting their termination with time. Further in-depth investigation of these identified variants will provide valuable knowledge about the evolution, infection strategies, transmission rates, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2."
8858,Discovery and Characterization of Spike N-Terminal Domain-Binding Aptamers for Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has devastated families and disrupted healthcare, economies and societies across the globe. Molecular recognition agents that are specific for distinct viral proteins are critical components for rapid diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate the selection of novel DNA aptamers that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with high specificity and affinity (<80 nM). Through binding assays and high resolution cryo-EM, we demonstrate that SNAP1 (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein N-terminal domain-binding aptamer 1) binds to the S N-terminal domain. We applied SNAP1 in lateral flow assays (LFAs) and ELISAs to detect UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations as low as 5×105 copies mL-1 . SNAP1 is therefore a promising molecular tool for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics."
