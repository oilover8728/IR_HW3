2194,"RT-qPCR Diagnostics: The ""Drosten"" SARS-CoV-2 Assay Paradigm.","The reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is an established tool for the diagnosis of RNA pathogens. Its potential for automation has caused it to be used as a presence/absence diagnostic tool even when RNA quantification is not required. This technology has been pushed to the forefront of public awareness by the COVID-19 pandemic, as its global application has enabled rapid and analytically sensitive mass testing, with the first assays targeting three viral genes published within days of the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence. One of those, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, has been heavily criticised for supposed scientific flaws at the molecular and methodological level, and this criticism has been extrapolated to doubts about the validity of RT-qPCR for COVID-19 testing in general. We have analysed this assay in detail, and our findings reveal some limitations but also highlight the robustness of the RT-qPCR methodology for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Nevertheless, whilst our data show that some errors can be tolerated, it is always prudent to confirm that the primer and probe sequences complement their intended target, since, when errors do occur, they may result in a reduction in the analytical sensitivity. However, in this case, it is unlikely that a mismatch will result in poor specificity or a significant number of false-positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses, especially as this is routinely checked by diagnostic laboratories as part of their quality assurance."

2197,Nasal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2: Synergistic or alternative to intramuscular vaccines?,"It is striking that all marketed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are developed for intramuscular administration designed to produce humoral and cell mediated immune responses, preventing viremia and the COVID-19 syndrome. They have a high degree of efficacy in humans (70-95%) depending on the type of vaccine. However, little protection is provided against viral replication and shedding in the upper airways due to the lack of a local sIgA immune response, indicating a risk of transmission of virus from vaccinated individuals. A range of novel nasal COVID-19 vaccines are in development and preclinical results in non-human primates have shown a promising prevention of replication and shedding of virus due to the induction of mucosal immune response (sIgA) in upper and lower respiratory tracts as well as robust systemic and humoral immune responses. Whether these results will translate to humans remains to be clarified. An IM prime followed by an IN booster vaccination would likely result in a better well-rounded immune response, including prevention (or strong reduction) in viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts."
2198,"Analysis of COVID-19 vaccines: Types, thoughts, and application.","Objective: To deal with COVID-19, various countries have made many efforts, including the research and development of vaccines. The purpose of this manuscript was to summarize the development, application, and problems of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: This article reviewed the existing literature to see the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: We found that different types of vaccines had their own advantages and disadvantages. At the same time, the side effects of the vaccine, the dose of vaccination, the evaluation of the efficacy, and the application of the vaccine were all things worth studying. Conclusion: The successful development of the COVID-19 vaccine concerns almost all countries and people in the world. We must do an excellent job of researching the immunogenicity and immune reactivity of the vaccines. We hope this review can help colleagues at home and abroad."
2199,The Promise of Aggregation-Induced Emission Luminogens for Detecting COVID-19.,"The long-term pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires sensitive and accurate diagnostic assays to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in infected individuals. Currently, RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based nucleic acid assays, while SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody are identified by immunological assays. Both nucleic acid assays and immunological assays rely on the luminescence signals of specific luminescence probes for qualitative and quantitative detection. The exploration of novel luminescence probes will play a crucial role in improving the detection sensitivity of the assays. As innate probes, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) exhibit negligible luminescence in the free state but enhanced luminescence in the aggregated or restricted states. Moreover, AIEgen-based nanoparticles (AIE dots) offer efficient luminescence, good biocompatibility and water solubility, and superior photostability. Both AIEgens and AIE dots have been widely used for high-performance detection of biomolecules and small molecules, chemical/biological imaging, and medical therapeutics. In this review, the availability of AIEgens and AIE dots in nucleic acid assays and immunological assays are enumerated and discussed. By building a bridge between AIE materials and COVID-19, we hope to inspire researchers to use AIE materials as a powerful weapon against COVID-19."
