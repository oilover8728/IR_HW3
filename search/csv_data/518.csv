5170,Parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for children: vulnerability in an urban hotspot.,"Objective: To compare hesitancy toward a future COVID-19 vaccine for children of various sociodemographic groups in a major metropolitan area, and to understand how parents obtain information about COVID-19. Methods: Cross-sectional online survey of parents with children < 18 years old in Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, in June 2020. We used logistic regression to determine the odds of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH) for racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups, controlling for sociodemographic factors and the sources where parents obtain information regarding COVID-19. Results: Surveys were received from 1702 parents and 1425 were included in analyses. Overall, 33% of parents reported VH for their child. COVID-19 VH was higher among non-Hispanic Black parents compared with non-Hispanic White parents (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.65, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): (1.99-3.53), parents of publicly insured children compared with privately insured (OR 1.93, (1.53-2.42)) and among lower income groups. Parents receive information about COVID-19 from a variety of sources, and those who report using family, internet and health care providers as information sources (compared to those who don't use each respective source) had lower odds of COVID-19 VH for their children. Conclusions: The highest rates of hesitancy toward a future COVID-19 vaccine were found in demographic groups that have been the most severely affected by the pandemic. These groups may require targeted outreach efforts from trusted sources of information in order to promote equitable uptake of a future COVID-19 vaccine."

5172,Individual and social determinants of COVID-19 vaccine uptake.,"Background: COVID-19 has had a devastating impact and efforts are being made to speed up vaccinations. The growing problem of vaccine hesitancy may affect the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. We examined the individual, communication and social determinants associated with vaccines uptake. Methods: Data come from a nationwide online probability-based panel of 1012 representative adults in the United States and the survey was conducted before the vaccines were available. People under the federal poverty level and racial and ethnic minorities were oversampled. Our outcome variables of interest were likelihood of vaccinating self and likelihood of vaccinating people under one's care (such as children) measuring behavioral intentions. Independent variables included perceptions of risk, exposure to different media for COVID-19 news, political party identification, confidence in scientists and social determinants of health. Logistic regression analysis was used to ascertain the effects of independent variables on the two outcome variables. Results: The results indicated that 68 and 65% agreed to get the vaccine for themselves and people under their care, respectively. Risk perceptions (severity of and susceptibility to COVID-19) were significantly associated with vaccine uptake. People who relied on ""conservative"" news outlets, Republicans, and who had low confidence in scientists are least likely to vaccinate self or children. Non-Hispanic Blacks and those with least schooling were also less likely to receive vaccine for themselves or people in their care. Conclusions: Our study identified race/ethnicity, risk perceptions, exposure to different media for COVID-19 news, party identification and confidence in scientists as factors that would be affecting COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The good news is that these are addressable through strategic public health communications, but a lot of work remains to be done with some urgency."

5176,Diagnostic accuracy of CT and radiographic findings for novel coronavirus 2019 pneumonia: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Purpose: To evaluate pooled prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity of chest computed tomography (CT) and radiographic findings for novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Methods: We performed systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase to identify articles reporting baseline imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. The quality of the articles was assessed using NIH quality assessment tool for case series studies. The pooled prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of imaging findings were calculated. Results: Fifty-six studies (6007 patients, age, 2.1-70 years, 2887 females, 5762 CT, 396 radiographs,) were included. The mean interval between onset of symptoms and CT acquisition was 1-8 days. On CT, the pooled prevalence of ground glass opacities (GGO), GGO plus consolidation, and consolidation only was 66.9% (95% CI 60.8-72.4%), 44.9% (38.7-51.3%), and 32.1 (23.6-41.9%) respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of GGO on CT was 73% (71%-80%) and 61% (41%-78%), respectively. For GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only, the pooled sensitivities/ specificities were 58% (48%-68%)/ 58% (41%-73%) and 49% (20%-78%)/ 56% (30%-78%), respectively. The pooled prevalence of GGO and consolidation on chest radiograph was 38.7% (22.2%-58.3%) and 46.9% (29.7%-64.9%), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of radiographic findings could not be assessed due to small number of studies. Conclusion: GGO on CT has the highest diagnostic performance for COVID-19 pneumonia, followed by GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only. However, the moderate to low sensitivity and specificity suggest that CT should not be used as the primary tool for diagnosis. Chest radiographic abnormalities are seen in half of the patients."
5177,Enablers and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake: An international study of perceptions and intentions.,"The development of COVID-19 vaccines is occurring at unprecedented speeds, but require high coverage rates to be successful. This research examines individuals' psychological beliefs that may act as enablers and barriers to vaccination intentions. Using the health beliefs model as a guide to our conceptual framework, we explore factors influencing vaccine hesitancy and health beliefs regarding risks and severity of the disease, along with individual variables such as income, age, religion, altruism, and collectivism. A questionnaire using newly created measures for various antecedents provided 4303 usable responses from Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, and the United States. A factor analytic and structural equation model indicates that trust in vaccine approval, the perceived effectiveness of the vaccine for protecting others, and conspiracy beliefs are the most significant drivers of intentions to vaccinate. Older people, those seeking employment, and those who have received a recent influenza vaccine are more likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The findings have implications for improving communication strategies targeting individuals about the merits of vaccination, particularly focusing on younger individuals and expanded message framing to include altruistic considerations, and to improve government transparency regarding the effectiveness and side effects of vaccines."

5179,[Allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines].,"In 2021 many people in the Netherlands will be vaccinated against COVID-19. The mass vaccination and the new types of vaccines trigger questions about the safety of these vaccines. In this paper we discuss: (1) what reactions are expected from COVID-19 vaccines, (2) what precautions are needed when vaccinating people, and (3) how to act when allergic reactions occur. The COVID-19 vaccines include the first vaccines produced with the mRNA platform. The most frequent adverse reactions are comparable with other vaccines. Allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are rare but can occur. These reactions may be related to excipients in the vaccines, like polyethylene glycol. In case of a possible allergic reaction, a doctor, in consultation with an allergist, can investigate whether vaccination is safe in the future and whether precautions are necessary. Allergic reactions to vaccine components must be recorded completely and unambiguously in the patient file."
