3920,Age-Related Changes in Clinical Presentation of Covid-19: the EPICOVID19 Web-Based Survey.,"Background: The influence of aging and multimorbidity on Covid-19 clinical presentation is still unclear. Objectives: We investigated whether the association between symptoms (or cluster of symptoms) and positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was different according to patients' age and presence of multimorbidity. Methods: The study included 6680 participants in the EPICOVID19 web-based survey, who reported information about symptoms from February to June 2020 and who underwent at least one NPS. Symptom clusters were identified through hierarchical cluster analysis. The associations between symptoms (and clusters of symptoms) and positive NPS were investigated through multivariable binary logistic regression in the sample stratified by age (<65 vs ≥65 years) and number of chronic diseases (0 vs 1 vs ≥2). Results: The direct association between taste/smell disorders and positive NPS was weaker in older and multimorbid patients than in their younger and healthier counterparts. Having reported no symptoms reduced the chance of positive NPS by 86% in younger (95%CI: 0.11-0.18), and by 46% in older participants (95%CI: 0.37-0.79). Of the four symptom clusters identified (asymptomatic, generic, flu-like, and combined generic and flu-like symptoms), those associated with a higher probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection were the flu-like for older people, and the combined generic and flu-like for the younger ones. Conclusions: Older age and pre-existing chronic diseases may influence the clinical presentation of Covid-19. Symptoms at disease onset tend to aggregate differently by age. New diagnostic algorithms considering age and chronic conditions may ease Covid-19 diagnosis and optimize health resources allocation. Trial registration: NCT04471701 (ClinicalTrials.gov)."
3921,"Willingness to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among healthcare workers in public institutions of Zhejiang Province, China.","This study aims to investigate healthcare workers' (HCWs) willingness to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in Zhejiang and to discover the related influential factors. The survey was conducted in six regions of Zhejiang Province, China, and 13 hospitals and 12 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were incorporated into the survey research. Participants were healthcare workers and a total of 3726 questionnaires were collected online, of which 3634 (97.53%) were analyzed. The relationships between the factors and the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 were computed as odds ratios (ORs) by means of multi-factor non-conditional logistic regression analysis. Of the 3634 participants, 2874 (79.09%) HCWs expressed their willingness to get vaccinated if the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available. Respondents who were younger than 50 years (OR = 1.502, 95% CI: 1.047-2.154), those who believed that they were somewhat likely (OR = 1.658, 95% CI: 1.297-2.120) or likely (OR = 1.893, 95% CI: 1.334-2.684) to get infected by SARS-COV-2 and those with a positive attitude toward the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were more willing to get vaccinated. Furthermore, compared to doctors, nurses were more reluctant to get vaccinated. In addition, it was found that higher the education level, lower the willingness to get vaccinated. This study revealed that HCWs in Zhejiang Province had a high willingness to get vaccinated. Awareness about the vaccine's effectiveness and safety and the disease severity should be promoted among HCWs over 50 years of age and nurses to increase the willingness to get vaccinated."

3923,2019-nCoV: The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus.,"2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 3I Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV."
3924,Assessing relative COVID-19 mortality during the second wave: a prospective Swiss population-based study.,"Objective: During the first COVID-19 wave in Switzerland, relative mortality was at least eight times higher compared with the uninfected general population. We aimed to assess sex-specific and age-specific relative mortality associated with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis during the second wave. Design: Prospective population-based study. Setting: Individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 after the start of the second wave on 1 October 2020 were followed up until death or administrative censoring on 31 December 2020. Participants: 5 179 740 inhabitants of Switzerland in fall 2018 aged 35-95 years (without COVID-19) and 257 288 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR or antigen testing during the second wave. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The planned outcome measure was time to death from any cause, measured from the date of a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis or 1 October in the general population. Information on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses and deaths was matched by calendar time with the all-cause mortality of the general Swiss population of 2018. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate sex-specific and age-specific mortality rates and probabilities of death within 60 days. Results: The risk of death for individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the second wave in Switzerland increased at least sixfold compared with the general population. HRs, reflecting the risk attributable to a SARS-CoV-2 infection, were higher for men (1.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.52) and increased for each additional year of age (1.01, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.02). COVID-19 mortality was reduced by at least 20% compared with the first wave in spring 2020. Conclusion: General mortality patterns, increased for men and older persons, were similar in spring and in fall. Absolute and relative COVID-19 mortality was smaller in fall. Trial registration: The protocol for this study was registered on 3 December 2020 at https://osf.io/gbd6r."
3925,Decolonising human rights: how intellectual property laws result in unequal access to the COVID-19 vaccine.,"The recent rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines offers hope in addressing the worst pandemic in a hundred years. However, many countries in the Global South face great difficulties in accessing vaccines, partly because of restrictive intellectual property law. These laws exacerbate both global and domestic inequalities and prevent countries from fully realising the right to health for all their people. Commodification of essential medicines, such as vaccines, pushes poorer countries into extreme debt and reproduces national inequalities that discriminate against marginalised groups. This article explains how a decolonial framing of human rights and public health could contribute to addressing this systemic injustice. We envisage a human rights and global health law framework based on solidarity and international cooperation that focuses funding on long-term goals and frees access to medicines from the restrictions of intellectual property law. This would increase domestic vaccine production, acquisition and distribution capabilities in the Global South."
3926,Coincidence of fever following COVID-19 vaccine and endemic tropical diseases: a challenge to clinicians during the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccination.,Coincidence of fever following COVID-19 vaccine and endemic tropical diseases may occur during the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccination. Clinicians should aware of this scenario when dealing with fever post-vaccination to prevent delayed diagnosis.
3927,Assessing the dilution effect of specimen pooling on the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to an unprecedented demand for diagnostic tests. Many studies have modeled the efficiency gains of specimen pooling, but few have systematically evaluated the dilution effect of pooling on the sensitivity of tests. Using the frequency distribution of cycle threshold (Ct ) values of our first 838 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, we modeled 100 specimens on the same frequency distribution. Given this distribution, we then tested dilutions of 1:5, 1:10, and 1:50 to find the percentage of specimens positive at each Ct value with each pool size. Using the frequency distribution and the percentage of specimens positive at each Ct value, we estimate that pools of 5 lead to 93% sensitivity, pools of 10 lead to 91% sensitivity, and pools of 50 lead to 81% sensitivity. Pools of 5 and 10 lead to some specimens with Ct values of ≥32 becoming negative, while pools of 50 lead to some specimens with Ct values of ≥28 becoming negative. These sensitivity estimates can inform laboratories seeking to implement pooling approaches as they seek to balance test efficiency with sensitivity."
