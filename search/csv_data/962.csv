9610,Effect of the Phytochemical Agents against the SARS-CoV and Some of them Selected for Application to COVID-19: A Mini-Review.,"Background: The aim of the present review is to provide basic knowledge regarding the treatment of Coronavirus via medicinal plants. Coronavirus (COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) as a viral pneumonia causative agent, has infected thousands of people in China and worldwide. Currently, there is no specific medicine or vaccine available that can treat or prevent this virus and this has posed a severe threat to human health; therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a novel drug or anticoronavirus vaccine. However, natural compounds to treat coronaviruses are the most effective alternative and complementary therapies due to their diverse range of biological and therapeutic properties. Methods: We performed an open-ended, English restricted search of Scopus database, Web of Science, and Pubmed for all available literature from Jan-March, 2020, using terms related to phytochemical compounds, medicinal plants and coronavirus. Results: The view on anti-coronavirus (anti-CoV) activity in the plant-derived phytochemicals and medicinal plants gives a strong base to develop a novel treatment employing these compounds for coronavirus. Various phytochemicals and medicinal plant extracts have been revised and are considered as potential anti-CoV agents for effective control of the virus and future drug development. Herein, we discuss some important plants (Scutellaria baicalensis, Psorothamnus arborescens, Glycyrrhiza radix, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Lycoris radiate, Phyllanthus emblica, Camellia sinensis, Hyptis atrorubens Poit, Fraxinus sieboldiana, Erigeron breviscapus, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, Amaranthus tricolor, Phaseolus vulgaris, Rheum palmatum, Curcuma longa and Myrica cerifera) that have emerged to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Conclusion: Nigella sativa has potent anti-SARS-CoV activity and it might be a useful source for developing novel antiviral therapies for coronavirus."
9611,'All In': a pragmatic framework for COVID-19 testing and action on a global scale.,"Current demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing is straining material resource and labor capacity around the globe. As a result, the public health and clinical community are hindered in their ability to monitor and contain the spread of COVID-19. Despite broad consensus that more testing is needed, pragmatic guidance toward realizing this objective has been limited. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a novel and geographically agnostic framework (the 4Ps framework) to guide multidisciplinary, scalable, resource-efficient, and achievable efforts toward enhanced testing capacity. The 4Ps (Prioritize, Propagate, Partition, and Provide) are described in terms of specific opportunities to enhance the volume, diversity, characterization, and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 testing to benefit public health. Coordinated deployment of the strategic and tactical recommendations described in this framework has the potential to rapidly expand available testing capacity, improve public health decision-making in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or to be applied in future emergent disease outbreaks."
9612,Enhanced sampling protocol to elucidate fusion peptide opening of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.,"Large-scale conformational transitions in the spike protein S2 domain are required during host-cell infection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Although conventional molecular dynamics simulations have been extensively used to study therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2, it is still challenging to gain molecular insight into the key conformational changes because of the size of the spike protein and the long timescale required to capture these transitions. In this work, we have developed an efficient simulation protocol that leverages many short simulations, a dynamic selection algorithm, and Markov state models to interrogate the structural changes of the S2 domain. We discovered that the conformational flexibility of the dynamic region upstream of the fusion peptide in S2 is coupled to the proteolytic cleavage state of the spike protein. These results suggest that opening of the fusion peptide likely occurs on a submicrosecond timescale after cleavage at the S2' site. Building on the structural and dynamical information gained to date about S2 domain dynamics, we provide proof of principle that a small molecule bound to a seam neighboring the fusion peptide can slow the opening of the fusion peptide, leading to a new inhibition strategy for experiments to confirm. In aggregate, these results will aid the development of drug cocktails to inhibit infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses."
9613,Viral pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and male reproductive health.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a new public health crisis, threatening almost all aspects of human life. Originating in bats, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted to humans through unknown intermediate hosts, where it is primarily known to cause pneumonia-like complications in the respiratory system. Organ-to-organ transmission has not been ruled out, thereby raising the possibility of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple organ systems. The male reproductive system has been hypothesized to be a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is supported by some preliminary evidence. This may pose a global threat to male fertility potential, as men are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection than women, especially those of reproductive age. Preliminary reports have also indicated the possibility of sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It may cause severe complications in infected couples. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of potential SARS-CoV-2 infection in the reproductive organs of males along with their invasion mechanisms. The risks of COVID-19 on male fertility as well as the differences in vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with females have also been highlighted."
9614,Application prospect of polysaccharides in the development of anti-novel coronavirus drugs and vaccines.,"Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it has spread rapidly worldwide and poses a great threat to public health. This is the third serious coronavirus outbreak in <20 years, following SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012. So far, there are almost no specific clinically effective drugs and vaccines available for COVID-19. Polysaccharides with good safety, immune regulation and antiviral activity have broad application prospects in anti-virus, especially in anti-coronavirus applications. Here, we reviewed the antiviral mechanisms of some polysaccharides, such as glycosaminoglycans, marine polysaccharides, traditional Chinese medicine polysaccharides, and their application progress in anti-coronavirus. In particular, the application prospects of polysaccharide-based vaccine adjuvants, nanomaterials and drug delivery systems in the fight against novel coronavirus were also analyzed and summarized. Additionally, we speculate the possible mechanisms of polysaccharides anti-SARS-CoV-2, and propose the strategy of loading S or N protein from coronavirus onto polysaccharide capped gold nanoparticles vaccine for COVID-19 treatment. This review may provide a new approach for the development of COVID-19 therapeutic agents and vaccines."
9615,Incentives can spur COVID-19 vaccination uptake.,"Recent evidence suggests that vaccination hesitancy is too high in many countries to sustainably contain COVID-19. Using a factorial survey experiment administered to 20,500 online respondents in Germany, we assess the effectiveness of three strategies to increase vaccine uptake, namely, providing freedoms, financial remuneration, and vaccination at local doctors. Our results suggest that all three strategies can increase vaccination uptake on the order of two to three percentage points (PP) overall and five PP among the undecided. The combined effects could be as high as 13 PP for this group. The returns from different strategies vary across age groups, however, with older cohorts more responsive to local access and younger cohorts most responsive to enhanced freedoms for vaccinated citizens."
9616,Reconsidering Assumptions of Adolescent and Young Adult Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Transmission Dynamics.,"Evidence regarding the important role of adolescents and young adults (AYA) in accelerating and sustaining coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks is growing. Furthermore, data suggest that 2 known factors that contribute to high severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmissibility-presymptomatic transmission and asymptomatic case presentations-may be amplified in AYA. However, AYA have not been prioritized as a key population in the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Policy decisions that limit public health attention to AYA and are driven by the assumption of insignificant forward transmission from AYA pose a risk of inadvertent reinvigoration of local transmission dynamics. In this viewpoint, we highlight evidence regarding the increased potential of AYA to transmit SARS-CoV-2 that, to date, has received little attention, discuss adolescent and young adult-specific considerations for future COVID-19 control measures, and provide applied programmatic suggestions."
9617,COVID-19: A series of important recent clinical and laboratory reports in immunology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and care of allergy patients.,"The “coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19)” outbreak was first reported in December 2019 (China). Since then, this disease has rapidly spread across the globe and in March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID‐19 pandemic.1 Since the outbreak was first announced, our journal has extensively focused on the clinical features, outcomes, diagnosis, immunology, and pathogenesis of COVID‐19 and its infectious agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)."
9618,Imaging in COVID-19-related myocardial injury.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2), previously named ""2019 novel coronavirus"" (2019-nCoV) is an emerging disease and a major public health issue. At the moment, little is known, except that its spread is on a steady upward trend. That is the reason why it was declared pandemic since March 11th, 2020. Respiratory symptoms dominate the clinical manifestations of the virus, but in a few patients also other organs are involved, such as their heart. This review article provides an overview of the existing literature regarding imaging of heart injury during COVID-19 acute infection and follow-up."
