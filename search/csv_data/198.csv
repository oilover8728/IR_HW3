1970,"Effective vaccine allocation strategies, balancing economy with infection control against COVID-19 in Japan.","Due to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control. It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss."
1971,Implementation of a Sample Pooling Strategy for the Direct Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Objectives: To report our institutional experience in devising and implementing a pooling protocol and process for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing over a 3-month period in the fall of 2020. Methods: The widespread testing implemented in the United States for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to a significant shortage of testing supplies and therefore has become a major impediment to the public health response. To date, several institutions have implemented sample pooling, but publications documenting these experiences are sparse. Nasal and nasopharyngeal samples collected from low-positivity (<5%) areas were tested in pools of five on the Roche cobas 6800 analyzer system. Routine SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR turnaround times between sample collection to result reporting were monitored and compared before and after sample pooling implementation. Results: A total of 4,131 sample pools were tested over a 3-month period (during which 39,770 RT-PCR results were reported from the Roche system), allowing our laboratory to save 13,824 tests, equivalent to a conservation rate of 35%. A 48-hour or less turnaround time was generally maintained throughout the pooling period. Conclusions: Sample pooling offers a viable means to mitigate shortfalls of PCR testing supplies in the ongoing pandemic without significantly compromising overall turnaround times."
1972,Simultaneous quantification of spike and nucleocapsid protein in inactivated COVID-19 vaccine bulk by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines are the most promising approach to control the COVID-19 pandemic. There are eminent needs to develop robust analytical methods to ensure quality control, as well as to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of vaccine. Although in vivo animal tests, such as serum-based ELISA, have been commonly used for quality control of vaccines, these methods have poor precision, are labor intensive, and require the availability of expensive, specific antibodies. Thus, there is growing interest to develop robust bioanalytical assays as alternatives for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of complex vaccine antigens. In this study, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was developed using optimized unique peptides for simultaneous determination of spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein. Method sensitivity, linearity, repeatability, selectivity, and recovery were evaluated. The amount of S and N proteins in 9 batches of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines were quantified, and their compositions relative to total protein content were consistent. We believe this method can be applied for quality evaluation of other S and/or N protein based COVID-19 vaccine, and could be extended to other viral vector, and protein subunit-based vaccines."

1974,Understanding the Role of Corona Virus based on Current Scientific Evidence - A Review with Emerging Importance in Pandemic.,"Coronavirus disease is a potentially deadly disease and of significant apprehension for global communal health because of its lethality. Vaccines and antiviral medications are still under trial to prevent or treat human coronavirus (HCoV) till date. The virus HCoV originated in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes respiratory syndrome having distinctive pathogenesis and infections of the respiratory tract. A mechanism was projected for the evolution of SARS virus, and a handy association with bats was found. When this virus reaches the respective host system, the infection starts with spike protein binding to its complementary receptor of the host cell. The coronavirus spike protein's association with its host cell receptor complement is crucial in deciding the virus infectivity, tissue tropism and species variety. Recent studies show that SARS Coronavirus 2 or COVID-19 requires protease to get into cells, offering a new therapeutic target. Distinctive attention and exertions should be given to defending or reducing transmission in vulnerable populaces, including those directly associated with caregiving and treatment and also aged one. Researchers are planning to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, and in this approach are also considered developing a vaccine that sensitizes our immune system preventing from this pandemic. The present review focuses on the role of S-spike protein in COVID-19, which helps the virus intruding the enzyme ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2). Passive antibody therapy is an additional alternative to use blood donors from hale and hearty people who have already recovered from COVID-19 and therapeutic advancement in handling the COVID-19 pandemic."

1976,COVID-19 Antibody Tests and Their Limitations.,"COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has developed into a global health crisis, causing over 2 million deaths and changing people's daily life the world over. Current main-stream diagnostic methods in the laboratory include nucleic acid PCR tests and direct viral antigen tests for detecting active infections, and indirect human antibody tests specific to SARS-CoV-2 to detect prior exposure. In this Perspective, we briefly describe the PCR and antigen tests and then focus mainly on existing antibody tests and their limitations including inaccuracies and possible causes of unreliability. False negatives in antibody immunoassays can arise from assay formats, selection of viral antigens and antibody types, diagnostic testing windows, individual variance, and fluctuation in antibody levels. Reasons for false positives in antibody immunoassays mainly involve antibody cross-reactivity from other viruses, as well as autoimmune disease. The spectrum bias has an effect on both the false negatives and false positives. For assay developers, not only improvement of assay formats but also selection of viral antigens and isotopes of human antibodies need to be carefully considered to improve sensitivity and specificity. For clinicians, the factors influencing the accuracy of assays must be kept in mind to test patients using currently imperfect but available tests with smart tactics and realistic interpretation of the test results."
1977,Comparative Analysis of Antigen-Specific Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Isotypes in COVID-19 Patients.,"Serological tests for detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Abs in blood are expected to identify individuals who have acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and indication of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many serological tests have been developed to detect Abs against SARS-CoV-2. However, these tests have considerable variations in their specificity and sensitivity, and whether they can predict levels of neutralizing activity is yet to be determined. This study aimed to investigate the kinetics and neutralizing activity of various Ag-specific Ab isotypes against SARS-CoV-2 in serum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients confirmed via PCR test. We developed IgG, IgM, and IgA measurement assays for each Ag, including receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) protein, S1 domain, full-length S protein, S trimer, and nucleocapsid (N) domain, based on ELISA. The assays of the S protein for all isotypes showed high specificity, whereas the assays for all isotypes against N protein showed lower specificity. The sensitivity of all Ag-specific Ab isotypes depended on the timing of the serum collection and all of them, except for IgM against N protein, reached more than 90% at 15-21 d postsymptom onset. The best correlation with virus-neutralizing activity was found for IgG against RBD, and levels of IgG against RBD in sera from four patients with severe COVID-19 increased concordantly with neutralizing activity. Our results provide valuable information regarding the selection of serological test for seroprevalence and vaccine evaluation studies."
1978,Therapeutics and Vaccines: Strengthening Our Fight Against the Global Pandemic COVID-19.,"The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health concern globally posing a significant threat to human health and economy and creating an unprecedented crisis in all spheres of the global life. Emergence of new genotypes of SARS-CoV during the last few years has pointed out the limited efficacy of available vaccines and antivirals, constraining the global response to the COVID-19 outburst to largely monitoring/containment. There is high priority for treatment regimes and new potential therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Several candidates have shown promising outcomes in various in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, clinical trials are in progress to test conceivable therapies showing promising outcomes in various in vivo studies. Unfortunately, very little information is available in the scientific scope which offers details to the diverse strategies being targeted to fight the pandemic, particularly with respect to the molecular targets. This review article summarizes and highlights the ongoing advances and approaches that are being carried out across the globe in designing vaccines and novel therapeutics, with particular reference to the previous knowledge gained from other viral infections like with the earlier SARS and MERS-CoV. A detailed knowledge may pave the way to combat this pandemic COVID-19 as well as prevent similar deadly epidemics in future."
1979,Mutations on COVID-19 diagnostic targets.,"Effective, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic reagents are of paramount importance for combating the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic when there is neither a preventive vaccine nor a specific drug available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It will cause a large number of false-positive and false-negative tests if currently used diagnostic reagents are undermined. Based on genotyping of 31,421 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples collected up to July 23, 2020, we reveal that essentially all of the current COVID-19 diagnostic targets have undergone mutations. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 has the most mutations on the targets of various nucleocapsid (N) gene primers and probes, which have been widely used around the world to diagnose COVID-19. To understand whether SARS-CoV-2 genes have mutated unevenly, we have computed the mutation rate and mutation h-index of all SARS-CoV-2 genes, indicating that the N gene is one of the most non-conservative genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We show that due to human immune response induced APOBEC mRNA (C > T) editing, diagnostic targets should also be selected to avoid cytidines. Our findings might enable optimally selecting the conservative SARS-CoV-2 genes and proteins for the design and development of COVID-19 diagnostic reagents, prophylactic vaccines, and therapeutic medicines.
