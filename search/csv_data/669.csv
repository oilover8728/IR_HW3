6680,The impact of biosensing in a pandemic outbreak: COVID-19.,"COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is the most astounding scene ever experienced in the XXI century. In this opinionated review, we underscore the crucial role of biosensing to handle with such situations. As a matter of fact, testing accelerates life-saving decisions on treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients in an early stage, and thereby, decelerating or even preventing the spread of such emerging infectious diseases. Meanwhile, it is also proven that a timely and broad application of testing leads to lower mortality rates in countries like Germany or South Korea. Besides, biosensors are also powerful tools for effective assessment of clinical progress and to provide alertness on severity or critical trends of infection. In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing. We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers. Finally, we outline our recommendations on biosensors and biosensing-related issues towards pandemic outbreaks."
6681,Protection and Response of a Tertiary Hospital in South Korea to the COVID-19 Outbreak.,"Objective: Here, we present an overview of how a tertiary hospital responded to maintain necessary activities and protect patients and staff from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. Methods: Gil Medical Center, a tertiary hospital in Incheon, has operated a special response team since January 21, 2020. All visitors were assessed for body temperature and respiratory symptoms, and screened for recent overseas travel. Suspected COVID-19 patients were taken to a screening clinic. All febrile patients with or without respiratory symptoms were taken to a respiratory safety clinic. An isolation ward, which consisted of 10 negative-pressure rooms, was used to treat confirmed cases. More than 120 beds were prepared for the outbreak, and patients with pneumonia were preemptively isolated. Results: By May 5, 480 960 visitors were assessed at the control station, 3350 patients visited the triage center, and 1794 were treated in the respiratory safety clinic. Seventeen confirmed cases were admitted to the negative isolation ward, and 350 patients with pneumonia were preemptively isolated. A total of 2977 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction tests were performed. Conclusions: While tertiary hospitals play an important role in treating both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients, hospital staff have to protect themselves from unexpected in-hospital transmission. A multifaceted response must be undertaken to protect tertiary hospitals and their staff during the COVID-19 epidemic."
6682,A single dose of self-transcribing and replicating RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine produces protective adaptive immunity in mice.,"A self-transcribing and replicating RNA (STARR)-based vaccine (LUNAR-COV19) has been developed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vaccine encodes an alphavirus-based replicon and the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein. Translation of the replicon produces a replicase complex that amplifies and prolongs SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein expression. A single prime vaccination in mice led to robust antibody responses, with neutralizing antibody titers increasing up to day 60. Activation of cell-mediated immunity produced a strong viral antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response. Assaying for intracellular cytokine staining for interferon (IFN)γ and interleukin-4 (IL-4)-positive CD4+ T helper (Th) lymphocytes as well as anti-spike glycoprotein immunoglobulin G (IgG)2a/IgG1 ratios supported a strong Th1-dominant immune response. Finally, single LUNAR-COV19 vaccination at both 2 μg and 10 μg doses completely protected human ACE2 transgenic mice from both mortality and even measurable infection following wild-type SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Our findings collectively suggest the potential of LUNAR-COV19 as a single-dose vaccine."
6683,Role of Peptides in Diagnostics.,"The specificity of a diagnostic assay depends upon the purity of the biomolecules used as a probe. To get specific and accurate information of a disease, the use of synthetic peptides in diagnostics have increased in the last few decades, because of their high purity profile and ability to get modified chemically. The discovered peptide probes are used either in imaging diagnostics or in non-imaging diagnostics. In non-imaging diagnostics, techniques such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), lateral flow devices (i.e., point-of-care testing), or microarray or LC-MS/MS are used for direct analysis of biofluids. Among all, peptide-based ELISA is considered to be the most preferred technology platform. Similarly, peptides can also be used as probes for imaging techniques, such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). The role of radiolabeled peptides, such as somatostatin receptors, interleukin 2 receptor, prostate specific membrane antigen, αβ3 integrin receptor, gastrin-releasing peptide, chemokine receptor 4, and urokinase-type plasminogen receptor, are well established tools for targeted molecular imaging ortumor receptor imaging. Low molecular weight peptides allow a rapid clearance from the blood and result in favorable target-to-non-target ratios. It also displays a good tissue penetration and non-immunogenicity. The only drawback of using peptides is their potential low metabolic stability. In this review article, we have discussed and evaluated the role of peptides in imaging and non-imaging diagnostics. The most popular non-imaging and imaging diagnostic platforms are discussed, categorized, and ranked, as per their scientific contribution on PUBMED. Moreover, the applicability of peptide-based diagnostics in deadly diseases, mainly COVID-19 and cancer, is also discussed in detail."
6684,Early Risk Factors for the Duration of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Viral Positivity in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"Background: Pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has became a pandemic. However, information on early risk factors for the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral positivity is not yet available. Methods: In this prospective study, a cohort of 137 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled. Clinical information and laboratory data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Viral positivity duration was calculated by the interval from the day of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive results to the day SARS-CoV-2 testing showed negative results in these 137 patients with COVID-19. Early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity were evaluated. Results: The median SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration is 12 days (range, 4 to ~45) for this cohort. Cox regression results showed a significantly shorter viral positivity duration was related to younger age (hazard ratio [HR], .658; P = .017); disease not being severe (HR, .653; P = .076); higher lymphocyte (HR, 1.464; P = .033), eosinophil (HR, 1.514; P = .020), and CD8+ T-cell (HR, 1.745; P = .033) counts; and lower IL-6 (HR, .664; P = .036) and IL-10 (HR, .631; P = .021). Multivariate analysis with covariable-adjusted results showed that the CD8+ T-cell count (HR, 2.376; P= .114) was a predominant risk factor for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity. Conclusions: Our findings show early laboratory parameters such as CD8+ T-cell count to be risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity, which has significance in the control and prevention of the disease."
6685,COVID-19 vaccine guidance for patients with cancer participating in oncology clinical trials.,"Emerging efficacy data have led to the emergency use authorization or approval of COVID-19 vaccines in several countries worldwide. Most trials of COVID-19 vaccines excluded patients with active malignancies, and thus data on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the vaccines in patients with cancer are currently limited. Given the risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, decisions regarding the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in patients participating in trials of investigational anticancer therapies need to be addressed promptly. Patients should not have to choose between enrolling on oncology clinical trials and receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical trial sponsors, investigators and treating physicians need operational guidance on COVID-19 vaccination for patients with cancer who are currently enrolled or might seek to enrol in clinical trials. Considering the high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in patients with cancer, the benefits of vaccination are likely to far outweigh the risks of vaccine-related adverse events. Herein, we provide operational COVID-19 vaccine guidance for patients participating in oncology clinical trials. In our perspective, continued quality oncological care requires that patients with cancer, including those involved in trials, be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination, which should not affect trial eligibility."
6686,COVID-19: Structural predictions of viral success.,"Since the beginning of the 21st century, three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused serious human disease: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in November 2002 [1, 2], Middle‐East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) in 2012 [3, 4], and SARS‐CoV‐2 in 2019 [5, 6]. SARS‐CoV‐2 [7], initially called 2019‐nCoV, is the etiological agent of COVID‐19, a highly contagious infectious illness that was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and subsequently spread globally [8]. As of May 24, 2020, COVID‐19 has caused >5,370,000 infections and >343,000 deaths worldwide [9]."
6687,Molecular Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 Variants.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evolution is expected, given the nature of virus replication. Selection and establishment of variants in the human population depend on viral fitness and on molecular and immunological selection pressures. Here we discuss how mechanisms of replication and recombination may contribute to the emergence of current and future variants of SARS-CoV-2."
6688,A 59-Year-Old Woman with Extensive Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Thromboembolism 7 Days Following a First Dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine.,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing cause of the current global healthcare crisis. Several vaccines were approved for use by emergency vaccination campaigns worldwide. At present, there are very few reports of COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune-thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a variant of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), in comparison to the massive number of vaccinated people worldwide. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with a 3-day history of sudden-onset left leg pain 7 days after receiving her first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech). She was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and found to have a positive HIT screen with optical density (OD) of 0.6 via ELISA test. She was hospitalized for 4 days and discharged home with an oral anticoagulant (rivaroxaban). CONCLUSIONS This case report describes a possible link between BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccination and thromboembolism. However, further data are needed to support such an association."
6689,Repeated SARS-CoV-2 Positivity: Analysis of 123 Cases.,"Repeated positivity and reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a significant concern. Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of repeatedly positive testing after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovery. We performed a systematic literature search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. With available individual patient data reporting on repeatedly SARS-CoV-2 positive (RSP) patients, case reports, and case series were included in this analysis. We performed a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics of repeatedly positive cases. We assessed the cases according to the length of their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative interval between the two episodes. Risk factors for the severity of second episodes were evaluated. Overall, we included 123 patients with repeated positivity from 56 publications, with a mean repeated positivity length of 47.8 ± 29.9 days. Younger patients were predominant in the delayed (>90 days) recurrent positive group. Furthermore, comparing patients with RSP intervals of below 60 and above 60 days, we found that a more severe disease course can be expected if the repeated positivity interval is shorter. Severe and critical disease courses might predict future repeatedly positive severe and critical COVID-19 episodes. In conclusion, our results show that the second episode of SARS-CoV-2 positivity is more severe if it happens within 60 days after the first positive PCR. On the other hand, the second episode's severity correlates with the first."
