5570,Development and Evaluation of Quantitative Immunoglobulin G Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Using Truncated Recombinant Nucleocapsid Protein as Assay Antigen.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Real-time RT-PCR is the most commonly used method for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, serological assays are urgently needed as complementary tools to RT-PCR. Hachim et al. 2020 and Burbelo et al. 2020 demonstrated that anti-nucleocapsid(N) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are higher and appear earlier than the spike antibodies. Additionally, cross-reactive antibodies against N protein are more prevalent than those against spike protein. We developed a less cross-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) indirect ELISA by using a truncated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein as assay antigen. A highly conserved region of coronaviruses N protein was deleted and the protein was prepared using an E. coli protein expression system. A total of 177 samples collected from COVID-19 suspected cases and 155 negative control sera collected during the pre-COVID-19 period were applied to evaluate the assay's performance, with the plaque reduction neutralization test and the commercial SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG ELISA as gold standards. The SARS-CoV-2 N truncated protein-based ELISA showed similar sensitivity (91.1% vs. 91.9%) and specificity (93.8% vs. 93.8%) between the PRNT and spike IgG ELISA, as well as also higher specificity compared to the full-length N protein (93.8% vs. 89.9%). Our ELISA can be used for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19."
5571,Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after COVID-19 vaccination.,"Cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenia induced by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been reported recently. Herein, we describe the first case of another critical disorder, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), in a healthy individual after COVID-19 vaccination. A 43-year-old Chinese farmer developed malaise, vomiting, and persistent high fever (up to 39.7 °C) shortly after receiving the first dose of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The initial evaluation showed pancytopenia (neutrophil count, 0.70 × 109/L; hemoglobin, 113 g/L; platelet, 27 × 109/L), elevated triglyceride (2.43 mmol/L), and decreased fibrinogen (1.41 g/L). Further tests showed high serum ferritin levels (8140.4 μg/L), low NK cell cytotoxicity (50.13%-60.83%), and positive tests for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA. Hemophagocytosis was observed in the bone marrow. Therefore, HLH was confirmed, and dexamethasone acetate (10 mg/day) was immediately prescribed without etoposide. Signs and abnormal laboratory results resolved gradually, and the patient was discharged. HLH is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome caused by aberrantly activated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells, which may rapidly progress to terminal multiple organ failure. In this case, HLH was induced by the COVID-19 vaccination immuno-stimulation on a chronic EBV infection background. This report indicates that it is crucial to exclude the presence of active EBV infection or other common viruses before COVID-19 vaccination."
5572,Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine Development: An Overview.,"To this day, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has not shown signs of abating. Moreover, the virus responsible for the pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has evolved into three different variants. This phenomenon highlights an even greater need to develop drugs and vaccines to control the rate of infection and spread of the disease. As of July 7, 2020, at least 160 vaccine candidates, 21 of which have entered the clinical trial phase, have been developed. This article describes the latest advances in development, reliable platforms, strategies used, and challenges that remain in developing COVID-19 vaccines."
5573,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy for pregnant women in Japan.,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is a global concern. The recent introduction of vaccines has provided a reason for hope, but new problems, such as vaccine hesitancy, have arisen. One of the most important of these issues is the safety of vaccines for pregnant women. In this article, we collected worldwide indications for vaccination, including women who are pregnant or who wish to become pregnant, and reports of adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccination. The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Japanese Society of Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology have published recommendations for the vaccination of pregnant women with a COVID-19 vaccine. The guidelines are as follows: (1) pregnant women should not be excluded from vaccination; (2) informed consent should be obtained before vaccination; (3) healthcare workers and pregnant women with complications such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity should be vaccinated preferentially; (4) vaccination should be avoided until 12 weeks of gestation during organogenesis; (5) spouse and family members should be vaccinated actively; and (6) nursing mothers are not particularly affected. This policy has been adopted in government guidelines. Additional efforts should be made to protect pregnant women from infection and severe illness with COVID-19 by eliminating vaccine hesitancy."
5574,SARS-CoV-2 and human milk: What is the evidence?,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as one of the most compelling and concerning public health challenges of our time. To address the myriad issues generated by this pandemic, an interdisciplinary breadth of research, clinical and public health communities has rapidly engaged to collectively find answers and solutions. One area of active inquiry is understanding the mode(s) of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Although respiratory droplets are a known mechanism of transmission, other mechanisms are likely. Of particular importance to global health is the possibility of vertical transmission from infected mothers to infants through breastfeeding or consumption of human milk. However, there is limited published literature related to vertical transmission of any human coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) via human milk and/or breastfeeding. Results of the literature search reported here (finalized on 17 April 2020) revealed a single study providing some evidence of vertical transmission of human coronavirus 229E; a single study evaluating presence of SARS-CoV in human milk (it was negative); and no published data on MERS-CoV and human milk. We identified 13 studies reporting human milk tested for SARS-CoV-2; one study (a non-peer-reviewed preprint) detected the virus in one milk sample, and another study detected SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in milk. Importantly, none of the studies on coronaviruses and human milk report validation of their collection and analytical methods for use in human milk. These reports are evaluated here, and their implications related to the possibility of vertical transmission of coronaviruses (in particular, SARS-CoV-2) during breastfeeding are discussed."
5575,Serological Evaluation of Human Antibodies of the Immunoglobulin Class A and G Against SARS-CoV-2 in Serum Collected in Newfoundland and Labrador.,"The ability to detect antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently under investigation with various performance characteristics and indications for use. In this article, we analyzed the ability of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin class G (IgG), EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG, and EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 ELISA immunoglobulin class A (IgA) kits to detect evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. We tested 49 known coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients and 111 prepandemic stored serology specimens. This resulted in a sensitivity of 95.9%, 100.0%, and 91.3% and a specificity of 98.2%, 98.2%, and 90.8% respectively, using manufacturer recommended cutoffs after inconclusive results (one for EuroImmun IgG and five for EuroImmun IgA) being excluded in the final statistical analyses. Cross-reactivity of hepatitis C virus seropositive specimens was observed resulting in false positives (p < 0.05). If a two-tiered algorithmic approach was applied, that is, testing with Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay followed by EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG, 100% specificity and sensitivity could be obtained after six inconclusive results were excluded from data set before statistical analyses. Performance characteristics presented demonstrate the superior performance of IgG class antibodies for investigating previous infections. In addition, utilizing a second antibody test for supplementary testing may significantly enhance performance, particularly in lower prevalence settings."
5576,Large and Small Cerebral Vessel Involvement in Severe COVID-19: Detailed Clinical Workup of a Case Series.,"Background and purpose: Case series indicating cerebrovascular disorders in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been published. Comprehensive workups, including clinical characteristics, laboratory, electroencephalography, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid findings, are needed to understand the mechanisms. Methods: We evaluated 32 consecutive critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated at a tertiary care center from March 9 to April 3, 2020, for concomitant severe central nervous system involvement. Patients identified underwent computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and autopsy in case of death. Results: Of 32 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 8 (25%) had severe central nervous system involvement. Two presented with lacunar ischemic stroke in the early phase and 6 with prolonged impaired consciousness after termination of analgosedation. In all but one with delayed wake-up, neuroimaging or autopsy showed multiple cerebral microbleeds, in 3 with additional subarachnoid hemorrhage and in 2 with additional small ischemic lesions. In 3 patients, intracranial vessel wall sequence magnetic resonance imaging was performed for the first time to our knowledge. All showed contrast enhancement of vessel walls in large cerebral arteries, suggesting vascular wall pathologies with an inflammatory component. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions for SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid were all negative. No intrathecal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG synthesis was detectable. Conclusions: Different mechanisms of cerebrovascular disorders might be involved in COVID-19. Acute ischemic stroke might occur early. In a later phase, microinfarctions and vessel wall contrast enhancement occur, indicating small and large cerebral vessels involvement. Central nervous system disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to long-term disabilities. Mechanisms should be urgently investigated to develop neuroprotective strategies."
5577,"COVID-19 under spotlight: A close look at the origin, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment of the 2019-nCoV disease.","Months after the outbreak of a new flu-like disease in China, the entire world is now in a state of caution. The subsequent less-anticipated propagation of the novel coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19, not only made it to headlines by an overwhelmingly high transmission rate and fatality reports, but also raised an alarm for the medical community all around the globe. Since the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered species, there is no specific medicine for downright treatment of the infection. This has led to an unprecedented societal fear of the newly born disease, adding a psychological aspect to the physical manifestation of the virus. Herein, the COVID-19 structure, epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, diagnosis, and therapy have been reviewed."
5578,CT imaging of the COVID-19.,"COVID-19 pneumonia presented with certain characteristic chest CT imaging features, which are helpful to the radiologist in the early detection and diagnosis of this emerging global health emergency. In this report, we present chest CT findings from five patients with COVID-19. Except for one case with normal lung appearance, all the other four cases had certain characteristics, including ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and atoll sign. The lesions were mainly distributed in the peripheral portion of lung."
5579,Therapeutic modalities and novel approaches in regenerative medicine for COVID-19.,"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak around the world has had an enormous impact on the global health burden, threatening the lives of many individuals, and has had severe socio-economic consequences. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have commenced intensive research on different therapeutic strategies, from repurposed antiviral drugs to vaccines and monoclonal antibodies to prevent the spread of the disease and treat infected patients. Among the various strategies, advanced therapeutic approaches including cell- and gene-editing-based therapeutics are also being investigated, and initial results in in-vitro and early phase I studies have been promising. However, further assessments are required. This article reviews the underlying mechanisms for the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, and discusses available therapeutic candidates and advanced modalities that are being evaluated in in-vitro/in-vivo models and are of note in clinical trials."
