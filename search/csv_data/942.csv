9411,"A systematic review of emerging human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak: focus on disinfection methods, environmental survival, and control and prevention strategies.","Recently, an outbreak of a novel human coronavirus which is referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) was identified in Wuhan, China. To help combat the pandemic, a systematic review (SR) was performed to collect all available studies concerning inactivation methods, environmental survival, and control and prevention strategies. A comprehensive literature survey yielded 42 eligible studies which included in the SR. The results confirmed that the WHO recommended two alcohol-based hand rub formulations (ethanol 70-95% and 2-propanol 70-100%) had an efficient virucidal activity in less than 60 s by more and equal 4 log10 (≥ 99.99) approximately and could be used for disinfection in public health and health-care facilities. The findings indicated that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 can survive under different environmental conditions between 4 and 72 h approximately. The results also demonstrate that temperature and relative humidity are important factors in the survival of SARS-CoV-2. The main strategies recommended by the WHO to avoid contracting SARS-CoV-2 are hand washing several times in the day and maintaining social distancing with others. It is important to note that the more studies require addressing, the more possible airborne transmission due to the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols for 3 h approximately. We hope that the results of the present SR can help researchers, health decision-makers, policy-makers, and people for understanding and taking the proper behavior to control and prevent further spread of SARS-CoV-2."
9412,"Childcare Exposure to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 for 4-Year-Old Presymptomatic Child, South Korea.","Data on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from preschool-age children to children and adults are limited. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 exposure at a childcare center in South Korea. A 4-year-old child, probably infected by his grandmother, attended the center during the presymptomatic period (February 19-21, 2020). Fever developed on February 22, and he was given a diagnosis SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 27. At the center, 190 persons (154 children and 36 adults) were identified as contacts; 44 (23.2%) were defined as close contacts (37 children and 7 adults). All 190 persons were negative for SARS-CoV-2 on days 8-9 after the last exposure. Two close contacts (1 child and 1 adult) showed development of symptoms on the last day of quarantine. However, subsequent test results were negative. This investigation adds indirect evidence of low potential infectivity in a childcare setting with exposure to a presymptomatic child."
9413,Current methods and prospects of coronavirus detection.,"SARS-COV-2 is a novel coronavirus discovered in Wuhan in December 30, 2019, and is a family of SARS-COV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), that is, coronavirus family. After infection with SARS-COV-2, patients often experience fever, cough, gas prostration, dyspnea and other symptoms, which can lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), kidney failure and even death. The SARS-COV-2 virus is particularly infectious and has led to a global infection crisis, with an explosion in the number of infections. Therefore, rapid and accurate detection of the virus plays a vital role. At present, many detection methods are limited in their wide application due to their defects such as high preparation cost, poor stability and complex operation process. Moreover, some methods need to be operated by professional medical staff, which can easily lead to infection. In order to overcome these problems, a Surface molecular imprinting technology (SM-MIT) is proposed for the first time to detect SARS-COV-2 virus. For this SM-MIT method, this review provides detailed detection principles and steps. In addition, this method not only has the advantages of low cost, high stability and good specificity, but also can detect whether it is infected at designated points. Therefore, we think SM-MIT may have great potential in the detection of SARS-COV-2 virus."
9414,Computational strategies to combat COVID-19: useful tools to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus research.,"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel virus of the family Coronaviridae. The virus causes the infectious disease COVID-19. The biology of coronaviruses has been studied for many years. However, bioinformatics tools designed explicitly for SARS-CoV-2 have only recently been developed as a rapid reaction to the need for fast detection, understanding and treatment of COVID-19. To control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is of utmost importance to get insight into the evolution and pathogenesis of the virus. In this review, we cover bioinformatics workflows and tools for the routine detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the reliable analysis of sequencing data, the tracking of the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluation of containment measures, the study of coronavirus evolution, the discovery of potential drug targets and development of therapeutic strategies. For each tool, we briefly describe its use case and how it advances research specifically for SARS-CoV-2. All tools are free to use and available online, either through web applications or public code repositories. Contact:evbc@unj-jena.de."
9415,Saliva for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in school-age children.,"Objectives: The high diagnostic accuracy indices for saliva severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) reported in adults has not been demonstrated in children, and adequately powered studies focused on the paediatric population are lacking. This study was carried out to determine the diagnostic accuracy of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in ambulatory children. Methods: During 1 to 23 October 2020, we recruited a population-based sample of children presenting for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Each child provided paired nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR N, E and RdRp gene detection. Results: Paired NP swab and saliva samples were obtained from 476 children with mean ± standard deviation age of 10.8 ± 3.9 years, and 58.2% were male (277/476). Nine participants were sampled twice, so 485 pairs of NP swab/saliva were tested. Virus detection in at least one specimen type was reported in 17.9% (87/485), with similar detection in NP swab (16.7%, 81/485) and saliva (15.9%, 77/485). Sensitivity and specificity of saliva RT-PCR was 87.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 78.5-93.9) and 98.5% (95% CI 96.8-99.5). The positive and negative predictive values were 92.2% (95% CI 84.2-96.3) and 97.6% (95% CI 95.7-98.6), with a kappa coefficient of 0.879 (95% CI 0.821-0.937). Concordance of findings between NP swab and saliva did not differ by age (p 0.67) or gender (p 0.29). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were significantly higher in NP swab/saliva pairs with discordant findings compared to those with both specimens positive. Conclusions: In light of these findings, we recommend saliva as a diagnostic specimen for COVID-19 screening in children."
9416,De novo design of new chemical entities for SARS-CoV-2 using artificial intelligence.,"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has severely affected the health and economy of several countries. Multiple studies are in progress to design novel therapeutics against the potential target proteins in SARS-CoV-2, including 3CL protease, an essential protein for virus replication. Materials & methods: In this study we employed deep neural network-based generative and predictive models for de novo design of small molecules capable of inhibiting the 3CL protease. The generative model was optimized using transfer learning and reinforcement learning to focus around the chemical space corresponding to the protease inhibitors. Multiple physicochemical property filters and virtual screening score were used for the final screening. Conclusion: We have identified 33 potential compounds as ideal candidates for further synthesis and testing against SARS-CoV-2."
9417,A Review on Screening Models for Potential Therapeutic Candidates and Targets Against SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronaviruses are a group of known RNA virus which primarily infect the respiratory tract, and also neurological, enteric, and hepatic systems. Endemic outbreaks of Middle East Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been observed in recent decades. A new strain named the SARS CoV-2(- COVID-19) virus has now spread across the globe. SARS-CoV-2 is highly communicable and has culminated in a massive pandemic of COVID-19. Currently, no successful treatment is available. Therefore, an urgent need is there for new screening models that can aid in identifying the drugs with potential activity against COVID-19. The current review aims to discuss various in-silico, in- -vitro and in-vivo screening methods that can potentially be used to expedite the discovery of new active therapeutic candidates and vaccines, drug targets, and repurposing the commercially available drugs against COVID-19 for the effective management of the infection and thereby controlling this pandemic. Further, the current status of drugs and vaccines under clinical investigation has been summarized."
9418,Mesenchymal stromal cell secretome in liver failure: Perspectives on COVID-19 infection treatment.,"Due to their immunomodulatory potential and release of trophic factors that promote healing, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are considered important players in tissue homeostasis and regeneration. MSCs have been widely used in clinical trials to treat multiple conditions associated with inflammation and tissue damage. Recent evidence suggests that most of the MSC therapeutic effects are derived from their secretome, including the extracellular vesicles, representing a promising approach in regenerative medicine application to treat organ failure as a result of inflammation/fibrosis. The recent outbreak of respiratory syndrome coronavirus, caused by the newly identified agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has forced scientists worldwide to use all available instruments to fight the infection, including the inflammatory cascade caused by this pandemic disease. The use of MSCs is a valid approach to combat organ inflammation in different compartments. In addition to the lungs, which are considered the main inflammatory target for this virus, other organs are compromised by the infection. In particular, the liver is involved in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes organ failure, leading to death in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We herein summarize the current implications derived from the use of MSCs and their soluble derivatives in COVID-19 treatment, and emphasize the potential of MSC-based therapy in this clinical setting."
9419,Large-scale sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from one region allows detailed epidemiology and enables local outbreak management.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organizations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1565 positive samples (172 per 100 000 population) from 1376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6 % of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. In total, 1035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of ~2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a discrete sublineage associated with six care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients, indicating infection control measures were effective; and found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility. The large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples has provided valuable additional data for public health epidemiology in the Norfolk region, and will continue to help identify and untangle hidden transmission chains as the pandemic evolves."
