6170,Intranasal plus subcutaneous prime vaccination with a dual antigen COVID-19 vaccine elicits T-cell and antibody responses in mice.,"We have developed a COVID-19 vaccine, hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD, that expresses SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins with modifications to increase immune responses delivered using a human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) platform. Here, we demonstrate subcutaneous (SC) prime and SC boost vaccination of CD-1 mice with this dual-antigen vaccine elicits T-helper cell 1 (Th1) biased T-cell and humoral responses to both S and N that are greater than those seen with hAd5 S wild type delivering only unmodified S. We then compared SC to intranasal (IN) prime vaccination with SC or IN boosts and show that an IN prime with an IN boost is as effective at generating Th1 biased humoral responses as the other combinations tested, but an SC prime with an IN or SC boost elicits greater T cell responses. Finally, we used a combined SC plus IN (SC + IN) prime with or without a boost and found the SC + IN prime alone to be as effective in generating humoral and T-cell responses as the SC + IN prime with a boost. The finding that SC + IN prime-only delivery has the potential to provide broad immunity-including mucosal immunity-against SARS-CoV-2 supports further testing of this vaccine and delivery approach in animal models of viral challenge."
6171,The effect of chronic DOAC treatment on clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.,"Background: Recent findings indicate that thrombosis is one of the underlying pathophysiology and complication of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the prognosis of the disease may be more favourable in people who were under oral anticoagulant treatment before the COVID-19 diagnosis. This study aims to evaluate the effects of chronic DOAC use on ICU admission and mortality in hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 infection. Method: Between 1 September and 30 November 2020, 2760 patients hospitalized in our hospital due to COVID-19 were screened. A total of 1710 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups as those who use DOAC due to any cardiovascular disease before the COVID-19 infection and those who do not. Results: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the DOAC group and 1631 patients in the non-DOAC group. Median age of all study patient was 62 (52-71 IQR) and 860 (50.5%) of them were female. The need for intensive care, in-hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation were observed at higher rates in the DOAC group. Mortality was observed in 23 patients (29%) in the DOAC group, and it was statistically higher in the DOAC group (P = .002). In the multivariable analysis, age (OR: 1.047, CI: 1.02-1.06, P < .001), male gender (OR: 1.8, CI: 1.3-2.7, P = .02), lymphocyte count (OR: 0.45, CI: 0.30-0.69, P < .001), procalcitonin (OR: 1.12, CI: 1.02-1.23, P = .015), SaO2 (OR: 0.8, CI: 0.77-0.82, P < .001) and creatinine (OR: 2.59, CI: 1.3-5.1, P = .006) were found to be associated with in-hospital mortality. DOAC treatment was not found to be associated with lower in-hospital mortality in multivariable analysis (OR:1.17, CI: 0.20-6.60, P = .850). Conclusion: Our study showed that the use of DOAC prior to hospitalization had no protective effect on in-hospital mortality and intensive care need in hospitalized COVID-19 patients."
6172,A global agenda for older adult immunization in the COVID-19 era: A roadmap for action.,"Given our global interconnectedness, the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgency of building a global system that can support both routine and pandemic/epidemic adult immunization. As such, a framework to recommend vaccines and build robust platforms to deliver them to protect the rapidly expanding demographic of older adults is needed. Adult immunization as a strategy has the broad potential to preserve and improve medical, social, and economic outcomes, including maintaining functional ability that benefits older adults, their families, communities, and countries. While we will soon have multiple vaccines against COVID-19, we must recognize that we already have a variety of vaccines against other pathogens that can keep adults healthier. They can prevent simultaneous co-infection with COVID-19, and may favorably impact- the outcome of a COVID-19 illness. Further, administering a vaccine against COVID-19 requires planning now to determine delivery strategies impacting how older adults will be immunized in a timely manner. A group of international experts with various backgrounds from health and aging disciplines met to discuss the evidence case for adult immunization and crucial knowledge gaps that must be filled in order to implement effective policies and programs for older adult immunization. This group, coming together as the International Council on Adult Immunization (ICAI), outlined a high-level roadmap to catalyze action, provide policy guidance, and envision a global adult immunization platform that can be adapted by countries to fit their local contexts. Further meetings centered around the value of adult immunization, particularly in the context of COVID-19. There was agreement that programs to deliver existing influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster vaccines, and future COVID-19 vaccines to over a billion older adults who are at substantially higher risk of death and disability due to vaccine-preventable diseases are more urgent than ever before. Here we present a proposed framework for delivering routine and pandemic vaccines. We call upon the global community and governments to prioritize action for integrating robust adult immunization programs into the public health agenda."

6174,Case Report: Sars-CoV-2 Infection in a Vaccinated Individual: Evaluation of the Immunological Profile and Virus Transmission Risk.,"During the COVID19 pandemic, a range of vaccines displayed high efficacy in preventing disease, severe outcomes of infection, and mortality. However, the immunological correlates of protection, the duration of immune response, the transmission risk over time from vaccinated individuals are currently under active investigation. In this brief report, we describe the case of a vaccinated Healthcare Professional infected with a variant of Sars-CoV-2, who has been extensively investigated in order to draw a complete trajectory of infection. The patient has been monitored for the whole length of infection, assessing the temporal viral load decay, the quantification of viral RNA and subgenomic mRNA, antibodies (anti Sars-CoV-2, IgA, IgG, IgM) and cell-mediated (cytokine, B- and T-cell profiles) responses. Overall, this brief report highlights the efficacy of vaccine in preventing COVID19 disease, accelerating the recovery from infection, reducing the transmission risk, although the use of precautionary measures against Sars-CoV-2 spreading still remain critical."
6175,Vaccines and variants: Modelling insights into emerging issues in COVID-19 epidemiology.,"Mathematical modelling has played a pivotal role in understanding the epidemiology of and guiding public health responses to the ongoing coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, we review the role of epidemiological models in understanding evolving epidemic characteristics, including the effects of vaccination and Variants of Concern (VoC). We highlight ways in which models continue to provide important insights, including (1) calculating the herd immunity threshold and evaluating its limitations; (2) verifying that nascent vaccines can prevent severe disease, infection, and transmission but may be less efficacious against VoC; (3) determining optimal vaccine allocation strategies under efficacy and supply constraints; and (4) determining that VoC are more transmissible and lethal than previously circulating strains, and that immune escape may jeopardize vaccine-induced herd immunity. Finally, we explore how models can help us anticipate and prepare for future stages of COVID-19 epidemiology (and that of other diseases) through forecasts and scenario projections, given current uncertainties and data limitations."
6176,A survey on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and concern among Malaysians.,"Background: Vaccination is an effective way to curtail the burden of COVID-19 in which success depends on a high acceptance of the vaccine. However, addressing concerns among vaccine-hesitant individuals is essential to avoid failure of the immunisation programme. This study sought to assess the concerns and acceptance rates regarding the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysians. Methods: An online questionnaire was distributed to 1411 respondents via a snowball sampling method among Malaysians aged 18 years and above. Results: The majority of the respondents were young adults (40.7%), female (62.8%), Malay (63.8%), Muslim (72.3%), married (52.9%), with tertiary education (86.8%) and without medical illness (85%). Social media (97.4%) was the primary source of information regarding COVID-19. The overall acceptance rate was high (83.3%), with the lowest rates among the elderly aged 60 years and above (63.4%) and pensioners (64.6%). Hesitance was caused by concerns regarding side effects (95.8%), safety (84.7%), lack of information (80.9%), effectiveness (63.6%) and religious (20.8%) and cultural factors related to the COVID-19 vaccine (6.8%). Respondents with diabetes mellitus (24.7%) and hypercholesterolemia (23%) were more hesitant to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, at 16.1 and 15.8%, respectively. Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance were age, religion, and current residence. Conclusions: The results indicate a high rate of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among Malaysians. Thus, the Malaysian government and other related agencies should increase their campaign and prepare to implement the COVID-19 mass immunisation programme among Malaysians. However, despite the high acceptance rate, it remains important to address concerns among hesitant individuals by building trust in vaccine safety and effectiveness through adequate information regarding the vaccine."
6177,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for physicians: Molecular characteristics and host immunity (Review).,"Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2)‑causing CoV disease 2019 (COVID‑19) emerged in China and has become a global pandemic. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a novel CoV originating from β‑CoVs. Major distinctions in the gene sequences between SARS‑CoV and SARS‑CoV‑2 include the spike gene, open reading frame (ORF) 3b and ORF 8. SARS‑CoV‑2 infection is initiated when the virus interacts with angiotensin‑converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells. Through this mechanism, the virus infects the alveolar, esophageal epithelial, ileum, colon and other cells on which ACE2 is highly expressed, causing damage to target organs. To date, host innate immunity may be the only identified direct factor associated with viral replication. However, increased ACE2 expression may upregulate the viral load indirectly by increasing the baseline level of infectious virus particles. The peak viral load of SARS‑CoV‑2 is estimated to occur ~10 days following fever onset, causing patients in the acute stage to be the primary infection source. However, patients in the recovery stage or with occult infections can also be contagious. The host immune response in patients with COVID‑19 remains to be elucidated. By studying other SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, it is hypothesized that patients with COVID‑19 may lack sufficient antiviral T‑cell responses, which consequently present with innate immune response disorders. This may to a certain degree explain why this type of CoV triggers severe inflammatory responses and immune damage and its associated complications."
6178,"Microfluidic Magneto Immunosensor for Rapid, High Sensitivity Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein in Serum.","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance and urgent need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for COVID-19 detection and screening. The objective of this work was to develop a simple immunosensor for rapid and high sensitivity measurements of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in serum. This assay is based on a unique sensing scheme utilizing dually-labeled magnetic nanobeads for immunomagnetic enrichment and signal amplification. This immunosensor is integrated onto a microfluidic chip, which offers the advantages of minimal sample and reagent consumption, simplified sample handling, and enhanced detection sensitivity. The functionality of this immunosensor was validated by using it to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, which could be detected at concentrations as low as 50 pg/mL in whole serum and 10 pg/mL in 5× diluted serum. We also adapted this assay onto a handheld smartphone-based diagnostic device that could detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein at concentrations as low as 230 pg/mL in whole serum and 100 pg/mL in 5× diluted serum. Lastly, we assessed the capability of this immunosensor to diagnose COVID-19 infection by testing clinical serum specimens, which revealed its ability to accurately distinguish PCR-positive COVID-19 patients from healthy, uninfected individuals based on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein serum levels. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of rapid (<1 h) SARS-CoV-2 antigen quantification in whole serum samples. The ability to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 protein biomarkers with high sensitivity in very small (<50 μL) serum samples makes this platform a promising tool for point-of-care COVID-19 testing."
6179,Herpes zoster after COVID vaccination.,"COVID-19 presents in various ways, but mainly as a pulmonary disease (Marzano, 2020). Skin manifestations have been reported, including reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (Marzano, 2020). Our case report describes two adults developing herpes zoster after vaccination with tozinameran (the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine). A possible cause for this reaction is a transient lymphocytopenia that occurs after the vaccination - similar to that in COVID-19 disease (Mulligan, 2020; Wang, 2020; Qin, 2020; Brabilla, 2020; Wang, 2020; Wei, 2017). In the context of vaccinating older and/or immunocompromised adults, our observations can be the starting point for further evaluation of a possible relationship between COVID-19, COVID vaccines, and herpes zoster."
