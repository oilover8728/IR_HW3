7580,Breast Milk and Breastfeeding of Infants Born to SARS-CoV-2 Positive Mothers: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study.,"Objective: There are limited published data on the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus from mothers to newborns through breastfeeding or from breast milk. The World Health Organization released guidelines encouraging mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to breastfeed as the benefits of breastfeeding outweighs the possible risk of transmission. The objective of this study was to determine if SARS-CoV-2 was present in the breast milk of lactating mothers who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test prior to delivery, and the clinical outcomes for their newborns. Study design: This was a single-center, observational, prospective cohort study. Maternal-newborn dyads that delivered at New York University Langone Hospital Brooklyn with confirmed maternal SARS-CoV-2 positive screen test at the time of admission were recruited for the study. Breast milk samples were collected during postpartum hospitalization and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genes N1 and N2 by two-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, the clinical characteristics of the maternal newborn dyad, results of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 testing, and neonatal follow-up data were collected. Results: A total of 19 mothers were included in the study and their infants who were all fed breast milk. Breast milk samples from 18 mothers tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, and 1 was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The infant who ingested the breast milk that tested positive had a negative nasopharyngeal test for SARS-CoV-2, and had a benign clinical course. There was no evidence of significant clinical infection during the hospital stay or from outpatient neonatal follow-up data for all the infants included in this study. Conclusion: In a small cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive lactating mothers giving birth at our institution, most of their breast milk samples (95%) contained no detectable virus, and there was no evidence of COVID-19 infection in their breast milk-fed neonates. Key points: · Breast milk may rarely contain detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA and was not detected in asymptomatic mothers.. · Breast milk with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a symptomatic mother had no clinical significance for her infant.. · Breast feeding with appropriate infection control instructions appears to be safe in mother with COVID infection.."
7581,Ocular Pathology and Occasionally Detectable Intraocular Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 RNA in Five Fatal Coronavirus Disease-19 Cases.,"Introduction: In December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic broke out. The virus rapidly spread globally, resulting in a major world public-health crisis. The major disease manifestation occurs in the respiratory tract. However, further studies documented other systemic involvement. This study investigates histopathologic eye changes in postmortem material of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded eyes from 5 patients (10 eyes) who died of COVID-19 at the University Hospital in Basel were included. Gross examination and histological evaluation were performed by 3 independent ophthalmopathologists. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies against fibrin, cleaved caspase 3, and ACE-2. Five enucleated eyes of patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2 served as control group. All cases have been studied for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of reverse transcription PCR and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). The choroidal vessels of one case were analyzed with electron microscope. Results: Ophthalmopathologically, 8 eyes from 4 patients displayed swollen endothelial cells in congested choroidal vessels. No further evidence of specific eye involvement of SARS-CoV-2 was found in any of the patients. In the 8 eyes with evidence of changes due to SARS-CoV-2, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated fibrin microthrombi, apoptotic changes of endothelial and inflammatory cells. In control eyes, ACE-2 was detectable in the conjunctiva, cornea, retina, and choroidea and displayed significantly lower amounts of stained cells as in COVID-19 eyes. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in both bulbi of 2/5 patients, yet ISH failed to visualize viruses. Electron microscopy showed no significant results due to the artifacts. Discussion/conclusion: As already described in other organs of COVID-19 patients, the ophthalmological examination revealed-microthrombi, that is, hypercoagulation and vasculopathy most probably due to endothelial damage. A possible viral spread to the endothelial cells via ACE-2 provides one pathophysiological explanation. The expression of ACE-2 receptors in the conjunctiva hints toward its susceptibility to infection. To what extend eyes, function is disrupted by SARS-CoV-2 is subject to further studies, especially in the clinic."

7586,Strategies and perspectives to develop SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and diagnostics.,"To develop diagnostics and detection methods, current research is focussed on targeting the detection of coronavirus based on its RNA. Besides the RNA target, research reports are coming to develop diagnostics by targeting structure and other parts of coronavirus. PCR based detection system is widely used and various improvements in the PCR based detection system can be seen in the recent research reports. This review will discuss multiple detection methods for coronavirus for developing appropriate, reliable, and fast alternative techniques. Considering the current scenario of COVID-19 diagnostics around the world and an urgent need for the development of reliable and cheap diagnostic, various techniques based on CRISPR technology, antibody, MIP, LAMP, microarray, etc. should be discussed and tried."

7588,Early Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibodies as a Serologic Marker of Infection in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"Background: Thousands of medical staff have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with hundreds of deaths reported. Such loss could be prevented if there were a serologic assay for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for serological surveillance of its infection at the early stage of disease. Methods: Using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell-expressed full-length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein as capturing antigen, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was developed and validated with negative samples collected prior to the outbreak or during the outbreak and positive samples from patients confirmed with COVID-19. Results: The specificity of the ELISA kit was 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human samples. The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 1 after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during hospitalization and 14 days after discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 28 of 276 asymptomatic medical staff and 1 of 5 nucleic acid test-negative ""close contacts"" of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: With the assays developed here, we can screen medical staff, incoming patients, passengers, and people who are in close contact with the confirmed patients to identify the ""innocent viral spreaders,"" protect the medical staff, and stop further spread of the virus."
