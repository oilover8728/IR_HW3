6090,SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR profile in 298 Indian COVID-19 patients: a retrospective observational study.,"Background: despite being in the 5th month of pandemic, knowledge with respect to viral dynamics, infectivity and RT-PCR positivity continues to evolve. Aim: to analyse the SARS CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR profiles in COVID-19 patients. Design: it was a retrospective, observational study conducted at COVID facilities under AIIMS, New Delhi. Methods: patients admitted with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for enrolment. Patients with incomplete details, or only single PCR tests were excluded. Data regarding demographic details, comorbidities, treatment received and results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, collected at different time points, was retrieved from the hospital records. Results: a total of 298 patients were included, majority were males (75·8%) with mean age of 39·07 years (0·6-88 years). The mean duration from symptom onset to first positive RT-PCR was 4·7 days (SD 3·67), while that of symptom onset to last positive test was 17·83 days (SD 6·22). Proportions of positive RT-PCR tests were 100%, 49%, 24%, 8·7% and 20·6% in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and >4 weeks of illness. A total of 12 symptomatic patients had prolonged positive test results even after 3 weeks of symptom onset. Age > = 60 years was associated with prolonged RT-PCR positivity (statistically significant). Conclusion: this study showed that the average period of PCR positivity is more than 2 weeks in COVID-19 patients; elderly patients have prolonged duration of RT-PCR positivity and requires further follow up."
6091,"Travel from the United Kingdom to the United States by a Symptomatic Patient Infected with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Variant - Texas, January 2021.","In December 2020, the B.1.1.7 genetic variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was first reported after emergence and rapid circulation in the United Kingdom (1). Evidence suggests that the B.1.1.7 variant is more efficiently transmitted than are other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and widespread circulation could thereby increase SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization rates (1,2). The first reported SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant case in the United States was confirmed by sequencing in Colorado on December 29, 2020.* This report describes a person who traveled from the United Kingdom to the United States after experiencing COVID-19-compatible symptoms† and was eventually confirmed to be infected with the B.1.1.7 variant."
6092,"Knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 vaccination in Kazakhstan: a cross-sectional study.","Background: There are several COVID-19 vaccines available and many are under different stages of development. However, vaccine hesitancy, including vaccination delays and refusals, represents a major hurdle for achieving herd immunity. The current study aims to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and the associated factors.Method: This is a cross-sectional survey-based study that was conducted between Aug and Nov 2020.Results: There were 417 respondents with nearly 61% females, more than 65% fall between the ages of 18 and 29 years, three-quarters holding a university degree, with more than 63% identified as single, and those who have no children represented more than 67% of the respondents. More than 36% of the respondents considered themselves COVID-19 vaccine hesitant. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy appeared to be high among female respondents (p = .02), aged 30 years old and above (p < .001), widowed or divorced (p < .001) and those who have a child (p < .001). One of the most vaccine hesitancy influencing factors is the vaccines' country of origin.Conclusion: There appears to be a high COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the participants with several associated factors. The current finding provides a knowledge base for policymakers for communication improvement and confidence-building in relation to COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination."

6094,Assessment of serological assays for identifying high titer convalescent plasma.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by the largest mobilization of therapeutic convalescent plasma (CCP) in over a century. Initial identification of high titer units was based on dose-response data using the Ortho VITROS IgG assay. The proliferation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serological assays and non-uniform application has led to uncertainty about their interrelationships. The purpose of this study was to establish correlations and analogous cutoffs between multiple serological assays. Methods: We compared the Ortho, Abbott, Roche, an anti-spike (S) ELISA, and a virus neutralization assay. Relationships relative to FDA-approved cutoffs under the CCP emergency use authorization were identified in convalescent plasma from a cohort of 79 donors from April 2020. Results: Relative to the neutralization assay, the spearman r value of the Ortho Clinical, Abbott, Roche, anti-S ELISA assays was 0.65, 0.59, 0.45, and 0.76, respectively. The best correlative index for establishing high-titer units was 3.87 signal-to-cutoff (S/C) for the Abbott, 13.82 cutoff index for the Roche, 1:1412 for the anti-S ELISA, 1:219 by the neutralization assay, and 15.9 S/C by the Ortho Clinical assay. The overall agreement using derived cutoffs compared to a neutralizing titer of 1:250 was 78.5% for Abbott, 74.7% for Roche, 83.5% for the anti-S ELISA, and 78.5% for Ortho Clinical. Discussion: Assays based on antibodies against the nucleoprotein were positively associated with neutralizing titers and the Ortho assay, although their ability to distinguish FDA high-titer specimens was imperfect. The resulting relationships help reconcile results from the large body of serological data generated during the COVID-19 pandemic."
6095,The provision of a time-critical elective surgical service during the COVID-19 Crisis: a UK experience.,"Introduction: With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, all elective surgery was temporarily suspended in the UK, allowing for diversion of resource to manage the anticipated surge of critically unwell patients. Continuing to deliver time-critical surgical care is important to avoid excess morbidity and mortality from pathologies unrelated to COVID-19. We describe the implementation and short-term surgical outcomes from a system to deliver time-critical elective surgical care to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: A protocol for the prioritisation and safe delivery of time-critical surgery at a COVID-19 'clean' site was implemented at the Nuffield Health Exeter Hospital, an independent sector hospital in the southwest of England. Outcomes to 30 days postoperatively were recorded, including unplanned admissions after daycase surgery, readmissions and complications, as well as the incidence of perioperative COVID-19 infection in patients and staff. Results: A total of 128 surgical procedures were performed during a 31-day period by a range of specialties including breast, plastics, urology, gynaecology, vascular and cardiology. There was one unplanned admission and and two readmissions. Six complications were identified, and all were Clavien-Dindo grade 1 or 2. All 128 patients had preoperative COVID-19 swabs, one of which was positive and the patient had their surgery delayed. Ten patients were tested for COVID-19 postoperatively, with none testing positive. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated the implementation of a safe system for delivery of time-critical elective surgical care at a COVID-19 clean site. Other healthcare providers may benefit from implementation of similar methodology as hospitals plan to restart elective surgery."
6096,COVID19 infection in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: A case report.,"Introduction: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired, life-threatening hemopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by the triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and impaired bone marrow function. Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. Patient concerns: A 27-year-old Caucasian man with PNH presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital with acute onset shortness of breath, cough and blood in urine. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with acute hemolytic exacerbation of PNH complicated with moderate COVID19 pneumonia. Outcomes: The patient was initiated with an anticoagulant unfractionated heparin, dexamethasone, and cefuroxime injection. His symptoms quickly resolved, and he was discharged after 5 days. Conclusion: The complement system activation is a critical component in the sequalae of COVID19 infection. Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. Notably, C5a concentration was noted to be higher in patients with COVID19 infection. The use of complement inhibitors to attenuate immune mediated damage in COVID19 nevertheless represents a very interesting theoretical approach. However, careful consideration as to which patients may benefit will be required and the outcome of clinical trials needed."
6097,Fifth-week immunogenicity and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with multiple myeloma and myeloproliferative malignancies on active treatment: preliminary data from a single institution.,"Background: Safety and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine are unknown in hematological patients; both were evaluated prospectively in 42 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and 50 with myeloproliferative malignancies (MPM) (20 chronic myeloid leukemias and 30 myeloproliferative neoplasms), all of them on active anti-cancer treatment, in comparison with 36 elderly controls not suffering from cancer. Subjects serologically and/or molecularly (by nasal/throat swab) positives at basal for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Primary endpoint was to compare titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and seroprotection rates among the cohorts at 3 and 5 weeks from first dose. Methods: Titration was done using LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test, a quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay approved by FDA on the basis of robust evidences of concordance (94.4%) between the test at cutoff of 15 AU/mL and the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 90% at 1:40 ratio. Cutoff of 15 AU/mL was assumed to discriminate responders to vaccination with a protective titer. Cohorts were compared using Fisher' exact test and the Mann-Whitney test as appropriated. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), geometric mean ratios and response rates after 1st and 2nd dose were compared in each cohort by Wilcoxon and McNemar tests, respectively. Results: At 5 weeks, GMC of IgG in elderly controls was 353.3 AU/mL versus 106.7 in MM (p = 0.003) and 172.9 in MPM patients (p = 0.049). Seroprotection rate at cutoff of 15 AU/mL was 100% in controls compared to 78.6% in MM (p = 0.003) and 88% in MPM patients (p = 0.038). In terms of logarithm of IgG titer, in a generalized multivariate linear model, no gender effect was observed (p = 0.913), while there was a significant trend toward lower titers by increasing age (p < 0.001) and in disease cohorts with respect to controls (MM: p < 0.001 and MPM: p < 0.001). An ongoing treatment without daratumumab was associated with higher likelihood of response in MM patients (p = 0.003). No swabs resulted positive on each time point. No safety concerns were observed. Conclusions: BNT162b2 has demonstrated to be immunogenic at different extent among the cohorts. Response was 88% and robust in MPM patients. MM patients responded significantly less, particularly those on anti-CD38-based treatment. These latter patients should be advised to maintain masks and social distancing regardless of vaccination status, and their cohabiting family members need to be vaccinated in order to reduce the risk of contagion from the family. Additional boosters and titer monitoring could be considered. Trial registration Study was formally approved by the IRCCS Central Ethical Committee of Regione Lazio in January 2021 (Prot. N-1463/21)."
6098,Identification of Epidemiological Traits by Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Sequences.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic that began in late December 2019. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily due to person-to-person transmission. To understand the epidemiological traits of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we conducted phylogenetic analysis on genome sequences from >54K SARS-CoV-2 cases obtained from two public databases. Hierarchical clustering analysis on geographic patterns in the resulting phylogenetic trees revealed a co-expansion tendency of the virus among neighboring countries with diverse sources and transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2. Pairwise sequence similarity analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted locally and evolves during transmission. However, no significant differences were seen among SARS-CoV-2 genomes grouped by host age or sex. Here, our identified epidemiological traits provide information to better prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to facilitate the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against the virus."
6099,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults and children in the United Arab Emirates: a nationwide cross-sectional study.,"Background: The psychosocial impact of previous infectious disease outbreaks in adults has been well documented, however, there is limited information on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults and children in the United Arab Emirate (UAE) community. The aim of this study was to explore anxiety levels among adults and children in the UAE and to identify potential risk and protective factors for well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2200 self-selected, assessed volunteers and their children. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. Descriptive analysis was carried out to summarize demographic and participant characteristics, Chi-square analysis to explore associations between categorical variables and anxiety levels and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of anxiety levels in adults and emotional problems in children. Results: The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for GAD-7 scores showed that being female, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19, intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smoking were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for SDQ showed that higher emotional problems were reported for children in lower and higher secondary education, and parents who had severe anxiety were seven times more likely to report emotional problems in their children. Conclusions: This study reports the psychological impact of COVID-19 among adults and children in the UAE and highlights the significant association between parental and child anxiety. Findings suggest the urgency for policy makers to develop effective screening and coping strategies for parents and especially children."
