7860,T and B cell Epitope analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein based on immunoinformatics and experimental research.,"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is pandemic with a severe morbidity and mortality rate across the world. Despite the race for effective vaccine and drug against further expansion and fatality rate of this novel coronavirus, there is still lack of effective antiviral therapy. To this effect, we deemed it necessary to identify potential B and T cell epitopes from the envelope S protein. This can be used as potential targets to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine preparations. In this study, we used immunoinformatics to identify conservative B and T cell epitopes for S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which might play roles in the initiation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified the B cell and T cell peptide epitopes of S protein and their antigenicity, as well as the interaction between the peptide epitopes and human leucocyte antigen (HLA). Among the B cell epitopes, 'EILDITPCSFGGVS' has the highest score of antigenicity and great immunogenicity. In T cell epitopes, MHC-I peptide 'KIADYNYKL' and MHC-II peptide 'LEILDITPC' were identified as high antigens. Besides, docking analysis showed that the predicted peptide 'KIADYNYKL' was closely bound to the HLA-A*0201. The results of molecular dynamics simulation through GROMACS software showed that 'HLA-A*0201~peptide' complex was very stable. And the peptide we selected could induce the T cell response similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the predicted peptides were highly conserved in different isolates from different countries. The antigenic epitopes presumed in this study were effective new vaccine targets to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection."
7861,Robotic RNA extraction for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance using saliva samples.,"Saliva is an attractive specimen type for asymptomatic surveillance of COVID-19 in large populations due to its ease of collection and its demonstrated utility for detecting RNA from SARS-CoV-2. Multiple saliva-based viral detection protocols use a direct-to-RT-qPCR approach that eliminates nucleic acid extraction but can reduce viral RNA detection sensitivity. To improve test sensitivity while maintaining speed, we developed a robotic nucleic acid extraction method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva samples with high throughput. Using this assay, the Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing (IGI FAST) research study on the UC Berkeley campus conducted 11,971 tests on supervised self-collected saliva samples and identified rare positive specimens containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA during a time of low infection prevalence. In an attempt to increase testing capacity, we further adapted our robotic extraction assay to process pooled saliva samples. We also benchmarked our assay against nasopharyngeal swab specimens and found saliva methods require further optimization to match this gold standard. Finally, we designed and validated a RT-qPCR test suitable for saliva self-collection. These results establish a robotic extraction-based procedure for rapid PCR-based saliva testing that is suitable for samples from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals."
7862,Follow-Up Survey of the Impact of COVID-19 on People Living with HIV during the Second Semester of the Pandemic.,"COVID-19 affects persons living with HIV (PLWH) both directly (via morbidity/mortality) and indirectly (via disruption of HIV care). From July-November 2020, an online survey was conducted to investigate the psychosocial well-being of PLWH and changes in HIV care during the second semester of the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected on the socio-demographic characteristics of PLWH, their psychosocial well-being, impact of COVID-19 preventive measures on their daily routines and HIV follow-up. Of the 247 responses analyzed (mean age: 44.5 ± 13.2 years; 73.7% male), 67 (27.1%) and 69 (27.9%) respondents screened positive for anxiety (GAD-2 score ≥ 3) and depression (PHQ-2 score ≥ 3), respectively. HIV care had returned to pre-COVID-19 state for 48.6% PLWH, and 108 (43.7%) had no HIV follow-up during the past month. Over three quarters (76.1%) of respondents expressed willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Compared to previous findings in April 2020, substance use increased from 58.6% to 67.2% (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that the well-being and medical follow-up of PLWH are still affected after almost a year into the COVID-19 outbreak. Remote HIV follow-up (telemedicine) with psychosocial support should be envisaged in the medium to long-term. Given that most PLWH accept COVID-19 vaccination, they may be prioritized for this intervention."
7863,SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Immunocompromised Patient Given Antibody Monotherapy.,"A 72-year-old immunocompromised man infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 received bamlanivimab monotherapy. Viral evolution was monitored in nasopharyngeal and blood samples by melting curve analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and whole-genome sequencing. Rapid emergence of spike receptor binding domain mutations was found, associated with a compartmentalization of viral populations."
7864,Changes in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Practices in Response to COVID-19: A Survey from the Worldwide Network for Blood & Marrow Transplantation.,"SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly worldwide, but the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains unknown. To understand this better, an 18-item online survey was disseminated by the Worldwide Network for Blood & Marrow Transplantation with questions exploring SARS-CoV-2 testing algorithms, mobilization, and cryopreservation strategies and COVID-19 infections in allogeneic related and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) donors. The aim of this survey was to assess the impact of the outbreak on policies relating to HPC mobilization, collection, and processing with respect to changes in daily routine. A total of 91 individual responses from distinct centers in 6 continents were available for analysis. In these centers, the majority (72%) of allogeneic related and autologous donors are routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 before HPC collection, and 80% of centers implement cryopreservation of allogeneic HPC grafts before commencing conditioning regimens in patients. Five related and 14 autologous donors who tested positive for COVID-19 did not experience any unexpected adverse events or reactions during growth factor administration (eg, hyperinflammatory syndrome). These data are limited by the small number of survey respondents but nonetheless suggest that centers are following the recommendations of appropriate scientific organizations and provide some preliminary data to suggest areas of further study."
7865,Identification and functional analysis of the SARS-COV-2 nucleocapsid protein.,"Background: A severe form of pneumonia, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization is widespread on the whole world. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was proved to be the main agent of COVID-19. In the present study, we conducted an in depth analysis of the SARS-COV-2 nucleocapsid to identify potential targets that may allow identification of therapeutic targets. Methods: The SARS-COV-2 N protein subcellular localization and physicochemical property was analyzed by PSORT II Prediction and ProtParam tool. Then SOPMA tool and swiss-model was applied to analyze the structure of N protein. Next, the biological function was explored by mass spectrometry analysis and flow cytometry. At last, its potential phosphorylation sites were analyzed by NetPhos3.1 Server and PROVEAN PROTEIN. Results: SARS-COV-2 N protein composed of 419 aa, is a 45.6 kDa positively charged unstable hydrophobic protein. It has 91 and 49% similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and is predicted to be predominantly a nuclear protein. It mainly contains random coil (55.13%) of which the tertiary structure was further determined with high reliability (95.76%). Cells transfected with SARS-COV-2 N protein usually show a G1/S phase block company with an increased expression of TUBA1C, TUBB6. At last, our analysis of SARS-COV-2 N protein predicted a total number of 12 phosphorylated sites and 9 potential protein kinases which would significantly affect SARS-COV-2 N protein function. Conclusion: In this study, we report the physicochemical properties, subcellular localization, and biological function of SARS-COV-2 N protein. The 12 phosphorylated sites and 9 potential protein kinase sites in SARS-COV-2 N protein may serve as promising targets for drug discovery and development for of a recombinant virus vaccine."

7867,Lung Ultrasound Findings in Patients With Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).,"OBJECTIVE. Although chest CT is the standard imaging modality in early diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the use of lung ultrasound (US) presents some advantages over the use of chest CT and may play a complementary role in the workup of COVID-19. The objective of our study was to investigate US findings in patients with COVID-19 and the relationship of the US findings with the duration of symptoms and disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS. From March 3, 2020, to March 30, 2020, consecutive patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test result for the virus that causes COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Lung US was performed, and the imaging features were analyzed. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the percentages of patients with each US finding between groups with different symptom durations and disease severity. RESULTS. Our study population comprised 28 patients (14 men and 14 women; mean age ± SD, 59.8 ± 18.3 years; age range, 21-92 years). All 28 patients (100.0%, 28/28) had positive lung US findings. The most common findings were the following: B-lines (100.0%, 28/28), consolidation (67.9%, 19/28), and a thickened pleural line (60.7%, 17/28). A thickened pleural line was observed in a higher percentage of patients with a longer duration of the disease than in those with a shorter duration of the disease, and pulmonary consolidations were more common in severe and critical cases than in moderate cases. CONCLUSION. Typical lung US findings in patients with COVID-19 included B-lines, pulmonary consolidation, and a thickened pleural line. In addition, our results indicate that lung US findings can be be used to reflect both the infection duration and disease severity."
7868,Very Long-acting Antivirals as Chemovaccines for Preventing Viral Infections.,"Following the advent of penicillin as first widely used antibiotic during World War II, viruses have steadily replaced bacteria as major agents of infections, particularly for microorganisms that can spread globally. Good examples are pandemics caused by HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and nowadays severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19."
