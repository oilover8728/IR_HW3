6961,The Use of In Silico Tools for the Toxicity Prediction of Potential Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.,"The current strategy for treating the Covid-19 coronavirus disease involves the repurposing of existing drugs or the use of convalescent plasma therapy, as no specific therapeutic intervention has yet received regulatory approval. However, severe adverse effects have been reported for some of these repurposed drugs. Recently, several in silico studies have identified compounds that are potential inhibitors of the main protease (3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease) and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. An essential step of drug development is the careful evaluation of toxicity, which has a range of associated financial, temporal and ethical limitations. In this study, a number of in silico tools were used to predict the toxicity of 19 experimental compounds. A range of web-based servers and applications were used to predict hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity, acute oral toxicity, carcinogenicity, cardiotoxicity, and other potential adverse effects. The compounds were assessed based on the consensus of results, and were labelled as positive or negative for a particular toxicity endpoint. The compounds were then categorised into three classes, according to their predicted toxicity. Ten compounds (52.6%) were predicted to be non-mutagenic and non-hERG inhibitors, and exhibited zero or low level hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Furthermore, from the consensus of results, all 19 compounds were predicted to be non-mutagenic and negative for acute oral toxicity. Overall, most of the compounds displayed encouraging toxicity profiles. These results can assist further lead optimisation studies and drug development efforts to combat Covid-19."

6963,Identification B and T-Cell epitopes and functional exposed amino acids of S protein as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus that it disease spreads in over the world. Coronaviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a genome of approximately 30 KD, the largest genome among RNA viruses. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. So, there is an emergency need for vaccines and antiviral strategies. The spike protein is the major surface protein that it uses to bind to a receptor of another protein that acts as a doorway into a human cell. The putative antigenic epitopes may prove effective as novel vaccines for eradication and combating of COV19 infection. A combination of available bioinformatics tools are used to synthesis of such peptides that are important for the development of a vaccine. In conclusion, amino acids 250-800 were selected as effective B cell epitopes, T cell epitopes, and functional exposed amino acids in order to a recombinant vaccine against coronavirus."
6964,Gynecological laparoscopic surgery in the shade of COVID-19 pandemic.,"A global public health problem with a high rate spread and transmission, Coronavirus outbreak has become the most talked-about matter throughout the world. We are severely affected by the nations with vast numbers of deaths; it was hard to predict such a colossal pandemic with terrifying consequences. Elective surgeries are limited, but situations requiring an urgent gynaecological or obstetric surgical approach must still be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns regarding surgical safety and the risk of viral transmission during surgery are of great importance. In this review, we aimed to summarize the concepts related to laparoscopic gynecological surgery during COVID-19 pandemic in the light of current literature."

6967,Therapeutic options in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pregnant patient.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has resulted in the development of various therapeutics to treat and prevent major complications related to the virus; pregnant patients are vulnerable to acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 because of frequent contact with the healthcare setting. Despite the publication of a plethora of case series and randomized control trials of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 therapeutics, few have addressed treatment in the pregnant population. To date, there has been no published review of therapeutic options in the treatment of pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Here, we provide a review of available treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, various trials with inclusion and exclusion of the pregnant patients, and potential side effects of each treatment in the pregnant patient."

6969,mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants and severe COVID-19 disease in Qatar.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to be a global health concern. The mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine was reported to have an efficacy of 94.1% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 due to infection with 'wild-type' variants in a randomized clinical trial. Here, we assess the real-world effectiveness of this vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, specifically B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta), in Qatar, a population that comprises mainly working-age adults, using a matched test-negative, case-control study design. We show that vaccine effectiveness was negligible for 2 weeks after the first dose, but increased rapidly in the third and fourth weeks immediately before administration of a second dose. Effectiveness against B.1.1.7 infection was 88.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83.7-91.5%) ≥14 days after the first dose but before the second dose, and was 100% (95% CI: 91.8-100.0%) ≥14 days after the second dose. Analogous effectiveness against B.1.351 infection was 61.3% after the first dose (95% CI: 56.5-65.5%) and 96.4% after the second dose (95% CI: 91.9-98.7%). Effectiveness against any severe, critical or fatal COVID-19 disease due to any SARS-CoV-2 infection (predominantly B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) was 81.6% (95% CI: 71.0-88.8%) and 95.7% (95% CI: 73.4-99.9%) after the first and second dose, respectively. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is highly effective against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infections, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, and against any COVID-19 hospitalization and death, even after a single dose."
