7460,A SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate would likely match all currently circulating variants.,"The magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the urgency for a safe and effective vaccine. Many vaccine candidates focus on the Spike protein, as it is targeted by neutralizing antibodies and plays a key role in viral entry. Here we investigate the diversity seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences and compare it to the sequence on which most vaccine candidates are based. Using 18,514 sequences, we perform phylogenetic, population genetics, and structural bioinformatics analyses. We find limited diversity across SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Only 11 sites show polymorphisms in >5% of sequences; yet two mutations, including the D614G mutation in Spike, have already become consensus. Because SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted more rapidly than it evolves, the viral population is becoming more homogeneous, with a median of seven nucleotide substitutions between genomes. There is evidence of purifying selection but little evidence of diversifying selection, with substitution rates comparable across structural versus nonstructural genes. Finally, the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence for the Spike protein, which is the basis for different vaccine candidates, matches optimized vaccine inserts, being identical to an ancestral sequence and one mutation away from the consensus. While the rapid spread of the D614G mutation warrants further study, our results indicate that drift and bottleneck events can explain the minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These findings suggest that a single vaccine candidate should be efficacious against currently circulating lineages."

7463,Highlights in the fight against COVID-19: does autophagy play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection?,"In the preceding months, the novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has devastated global communities. The need for safe and effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments to combat COVID-19 - the human disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection - is clear. Here, we present recent developments in the effort to combat COVID-19 and consider whether SARS-CoV-2 may potentially interact with the host autophagy pathway.

7464,Profile of SARS-CoV-2.,"The recent emergence of a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‑2, SARS-CoV-2) that is transmitted efficiently among humans and can result in serious disease and/or death has become a global threat to public health and economy. In this article, we describe some of the most important characteristics of this new virus (including gaps in our understanding) and provide a perspective of ongoing activities for developing virus-specific countermeasures, such as vaccines and antiviral drugs."
7465,Functional and druggability analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome.,"The infectious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread worldwide. As of today, more than 46 million people have been infected and over 1.2 million fatalities. With the purpose of contributing to the development of effective therapeutics, we performed an in silico determination of binding hot-spots and an assessment of their druggability within the complete SARS-CoV-2 proteome. All structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins have been studied, and whenever experimental structural data of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were not available, homology models were built based on solved SARS-CoV structures. Several potential allosteric or protein-protein interaction druggable sites on different viral targets were identified, knowledge that could be used to expand current drug discovery endeavors beyond the currently explored cysteine proteases and the polymerase complex. It is our hope that this study will support the efforts of the scientific community both in understanding the molecular determinants of this disease and in widening the repertoire of viral targets in the quest for repurposed or novel drugs against COVID-19."

7467,Dexamethasone for Severe COVID-19: How Does It Work at Cellular and Molecular Levels?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection of the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) significantly impacted human society. Recently, the synthetic pure glucocorticoid dexamethasone was identified as an effective compound for treatment of severe COVID-19. However, glucocorticoids are generally harmful for infectious diseases, such as bacterial sepsis and severe influenza pneumonia, which can develop respiratory failure and systemic inflammation similar to COVID-19. This apparent inconsistency suggests the presence of pathologic mechanism(s) unique to COVID-19 that renders this steroid effective. We review plausible mechanisms and advance the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by infected cell-specific glucocorticoid insensitivity as reported for some other viruses. This alteration in local glucocorticoid actions interferes with undesired glucocorticoid to facilitate viral replication but does not affect desired anti-inflammatory properties in non-infected organs/tissues. We postulate that the virus coincidentally causes glucocorticoid insensitivity in the process of modulating host cell activities for promoting its replication in infected cells. We explore this tenet focusing on SARS-CoV-2-encoding proteins and potential molecular mechanisms supporting this hypothetical glucocorticoid insensitivity unique to COVID-19 but not characteristic of other life-threatening viral diseases, probably due to a difference in specific virally-encoded molecules and host cell activities modulated by them."
7468,A review on detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in light of the current knowledge of treatment process for removal of viral fragments.,"The entire globe is affected by the novel disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV), which is formally recognised as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organisation (WHO) announced this disease as a global pandemic. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in unprocessed wastewater has become a cause of worry due to these emerging pathogens in the process of wastewater treatment, as reported in the present study. This analysis intends to interpret the fate, environmental factors and route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, along with its eradication by treating the wastewater for controlling and preventing its further spread. Different recovery estimations of the virus have been depicted by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater through the viral concentration techniques. Most frequently used viral concentration techniques include polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, ultrafiltration, electronegative membrane, and ultracentrifugation, after which the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are done in wastewater samples through quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) holds the key responsibility of eliminating pathogens prior to the discharge of wastewater into surface water bodies. The removal of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the treatment stage is dependent on the operations of wastewater treatment systems during the outbreak of the virus; particularly, in the urban and extensively populated regions. Efficient primary, secondary and tertiary methods of wastewater treatment and disinfection can reduce or inactivate SARS-CoV-2 RNA before being drained out. Nonetheless, further studies regarding COVID-19-related disinfectants, environment conditions and viral concentrations in each treatment procedure, implications on the environment and regular monitoring of transmission need to be done urgently. Hence, monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples of wastewater under the procedure of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) supplement the real-time data pertaining to the investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic in the community, regional and national levels."
