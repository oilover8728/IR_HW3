4140,Culture-Based Virus Isolation To Evaluate Potential Infectivity of Clinical Specimens Tested for COVID-19.,"Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) is currently the most sensitive method to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the correlation between detectable viral RNA and culturable virus in clinical specimens remains unclear. Here, we performed virus culture for 60 specimens that were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR. The virus could be successfully isolated from 12 throat and nine nasopharyngeal swabs and two sputum specimens. The lowest copy number required for virus isolation was determined to be 5.4, 6.0, and 5.7 log10 genome copies/ml sample for detecting the nsp12, E, and N genes, respectively. We further examined the correlation of genome copy number and virus isolation in different regions of the viral genome, demonstrating that culturable specimens are characterized by high copy numbers with a linear correlation observed between copy numbers of amplicons targeting structural and nonstructural regions. Overall, these results indicate that in addition to the copy number, the integrity of the viral genome should be considered when evaluating the infectivity of clinical SARS-CoV-2 specimens."

4142,Quantifying the potential value of antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19: a modelling analysis.,"Background: Testing plays a critical role in treatment and prevention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to nucleic acid tests (NATs), antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can be more accessible, but typically have lower sensitivity and specificity. By quantifying these trade-offs, we aimed to inform decisions about when an Ag-RDT would offer greater public health value than reliance on NAT. Methods: Following an expert consultation, we selected two use cases for analysis: rapid identification of people with COVID-19 amongst patients admitted with respiratory symptoms in a 'hospital' setting and early identification and isolation of people with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 in a 'community' setting. Using decision analysis, we evaluated the health system cost and health impact (deaths averted and infectious days isolated) of an Ag-RDT-led strategy, compared to a strategy based on NAT and clinical judgement. We adopted a broad range of values for 'contextual' parameters relevant to a range of settings, including the availability of NAT and the performance of clinical judgement. We performed a multivariate sensitivity analysis to all of these parameters. Results: In a hospital setting, an Ag-RDT-led strategy would avert more deaths than a NAT-based strategy, and at lower cost per death averted, when the sensitivity of clinical judgement is less than 90%, and when NAT results are available in time to inform clinical decision-making for less than 85% of patients. The use of an Ag-RDT is robustly supported in community settings, where it would avert more transmission at lower cost than relying on NAT alone, under a wide range of assumptions. Conclusions: Despite their imperfect sensitivity and specificity, Ag-RDTs have the potential to be simultaneously more impactful, and have a lower cost per death and infectious person-days averted, than current approaches to COVID-19 diagnostic testing."
4143,SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs is not an independent predictor of unfavorable outcome.,"The aim was to assess the ability of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load at first patient's hospital evaluation to predict unfavorable outcomes. We conducted a prospective cohort study including 321 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 through RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs. Quantitative Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA cycle threshold values were used to calculate the viral load in log10 copies/mL. Disease severity at the end of follow up was categorized into mild, moderate, and severe. Primary endpoint was a composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death (n = 85, 26.4%). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load over the second quartile (≥ 7.35 log10 copies/mL, p = 0.003) and second tertile (≥ 8.27 log10 copies/mL, p = 0.01) were associated to unfavorable outcome in the unadjusted logistic regression analysis. However, in the final multivariable analysis, viral load was not independently associated with an unfavorable outcome. Five predictors were independently associated with increased odds of ICU admission and/or death: age ≥ 70 years, SpO2, neutrophils > 7.5 × 103/µL, lactate dehydrogenase ≥ 300 U/L, and C-reactive protein ≥ 100 mg/L. In summary, nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load on admission is generally high in patients with COVID-19, regardless of illness severity, but it cannot be used as an independent predictor of unfavorable clinical outcome."
4144,Versatile and flexible microfluidic qPCR test for high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 and cellular response detection in nasopharyngeal swab samples.,"The emergence and quick spread of SARS-CoV-2 has pointed at a low capacity response for testing large populations in many countries, in line of material, technical and staff limitations. The traditional RT-qPCR diagnostic test remains the reference method and is by far the most widely used test. These assays are limited to a few probe sets, require large sample PCR reaction volumes, along with an expensive and time-consuming RNA extraction step. Here we describe a quantitative nanofluidic assay that overcomes some of these shortcomings, based on the BiomarkTM instrument from Fluidigm. This system offers the possibility of performing 4608 qPCR end-points in a single run, equivalent to 192 clinical samples combined with 12 pairs of primers/probe sets in duplicate, thus allowing the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 including the detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as the detection other pathogens and/or host cellular responses (virus receptors, response markers, microRNAs). The 10 nL-range volume of BiomarkTM reactions is compatible with sensitive and reproducible reactions that can be easily and cost-effectively adapted to various RT-qPCR configurations and sets of primers/probe. Finally, we also evaluated the use of inactivating lysis buffers composed of various detergents in the presence or absence of proteinase K to assess the compatibility of these buffers with a direct reverse transcription enzymatic step and we propose several protocols, bypassing the need for RNA purification. We advocate that the combined utilization of an optimized processing buffer and a high-throughput real-time PCR device would contribute to improve the turn-around-time to deliver the test results to patients and increase the SARS-CoV-2 testing capacities."
4145,Ending the Pandemic: Are Rapid COVID-19 Tests a Step Forward or Back?,"Some experts have promoted the use of rapid testing for COVID-19. However, with the current technologies available, continuing to replace laboratory-based, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests with rapid (point-of-care) tests may lead to an increased number of false negative tests. Moreover, the more rapid dissemination of false negative results that can occur with the use of rapid tests for COVID-19 may lead to increased spread of the novel coronavirus if patients do not understand the concept of false negative tests. One means of combatting this would be to tell patients who have a ""negative"" rapid COVID-19 test that their test result was ""indeterminate."""
4146,Immunochromatographic test for differentiation detection of IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2.,"The study presents the results of the creation and evaluation of the diagnostic characteristics of the rapid immunochromatographic test for the qualitative detection and differentiation of IgM/IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum, plasma, and whole blood ""ИХА-COVID-19-IgM / IgG"". Have been tested some samples without antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and a samples with two and one type of specific antibodies. The coincidence of the results of immunochromatographic analysis with the results of the immunochemiluminescent method was 87.2%. Test kit can be use as the rapid diagnostic test in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the immune status of convalescents."

4148,COVID-19 in pregnancy.,"Pregnant women with COVID-19 are less likely to be symptomatic than non-pregnant counterparts. Risk factors for severe disease include being overweight or obese, greater than 35 years old, and having pre-existing comorbidities. Those who develop severe disease have increased rates of admission to an intensive care unit, requiring invasive ventilation and pre-term birth.Pregnant and breastfeeding women with COVID-19 should be investigated as of outside pregnancy and should receive proven therapies (such as corticosteroids and tocilizumab) on a risk/benefit basis. Admitted women should receive multidisciplinary care with input from senior decision makers and early escalation where required. There are no safety concerns -surrounding the COVID-19 vaccination and fertility or pregnancy, and so it should be offered to women based on their age and clinical risk group, in line with non-pregnant women."
4149,Evaluation of the immune response to COVID-19 vaccine mRNA BNT162b2 and correlation with previous COVID-19 infection.,"Background: The kinetics of immune response after vaccination with mRNA-BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®) and the correlation with previous COVID-19 infection are still unclear. Methods: Thirty-six subjects receiving mRNA-BNT162b2 were prospectively studied [10 days after the first dose (Time 1), 7 days and 16 weeks after the second dose (Time 2 and Time 3)] to determine antibody titers against nucleocapside, trimeric spike protein (TSP) and receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Ten subjects had a previous COVID-19 infection not requiring hospitalization (Group 1) and 26 did not (Group 2). Results: At Time 1 all subjects in Group 1 had IgG against TSP > 800 AU/mL compared to 11/26 (42.3%) in Group 2, whilst at Time 2 all subjects in both groups had > 800 AU/mL. The mean IgG against TSP titer at Time 3 was 711 AU/mL (95% CI 652-800) in Group 1 and 240 AU/mL (95% CI 112-375) in Group 2 (p < 0.0001). However, all subjects in both groups maintained antibody titers above the lower threshold limit at each time-point considered. These results were confirmed also using anti-RBD antibodiy tests. Antibodies against nucleocapside were reactive only in subjects in Group 1 and remained stable during the study period. No subject had a new onset of COVID-19 infection within 16 weeks of follow-up. Conclusions: Subjects with previous COVID-19 infection have a more rapid immune response to mRNA-BNT162b2 than others and maintained higher antibody titers during 16 weeks of follow-up. However, no new COVID-19 infection also in subjects with lower antibody titers."
