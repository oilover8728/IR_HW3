We do not have any drug or vaccine available for the inhibition of this deadly virus. The expedition for searching a potential drug or vaccine against COVID-19 will be of massive potential and favor. This study is focused on finding an effective natural origin compound which can put a check on the activity of this virus. We chose important proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 genome such as NSP4, NSP15 and RdRp along-with the human ACE2 receptor which is the first point of contact with the virus. Virtual screening and followed up molecular docking resulted in Baicalin and Limonin as the final lead molecules. 200 ns of MD simulation for each protein-ligand complex provides the insights that Baicalin has a potential to target NSP4, NSP15 and RdRp proteins. Limonin which is largely used in traditional Indian medicine system is found to inhibit the human ACE2 receptor (making it inefficient in binding to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2). Our studies propose Baicalin and Limonin in combination to be studied in vitro and in vivo against COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
1392,Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2/COVID19.,"Purpose of review: SARS-CoV-2 is the novel human coronavirus responsible for the COVID19 pandemic. Accurate detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of efforts to treat individual patients and to contain spread of the virus in the community. The purpose of this review is to describe current diagnostic modalities for SARS-CoV-2 and outline their use. Special considerations for pediatric age groups are included. Recent findings: RNA PCR from the upper respiratory tract remains the gold standard for detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Antigen testing is being widely deployed as a faster and more convenient alternative to PCR, but is less sensitive and should only be used for diagnosis early after symptom onset. Serologic assays can document prior infection and are helpful in diagnosing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Serologic testing should not be used to diagnose acute or active infection. Immune assays are likely to provide a useful measure of protection against COVID19 in the future as knowledge of protective responses improves. Summary: A variety of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics have recently been developed and deployed. Clinicians should understand the appropriate use and interpretation of RNA PCR, antigen testing and immune assays for SARS-CoV-2 in order to diagnose and treat patients in this evolving pandemic."
1393,Association between SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies and Commercial Serological Assays.,"Background: Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays based on different viral antigens have been approved for the qualitative determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, there are limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies. Methods: Sixty-six specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes. Results: The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46, respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) and 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) and 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) and 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who were intubated, had cardiac injury, or acute kidney injury from COVID-19 infection had higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization."
1394,European multicenter evaluation of Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV test.,"Rapid diagnostics for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are paramount for reducing the spread of the current pandemic. During additional seasonal epidemics with influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the clinical signs and symptoms cannot be distinguished easily from SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a new assay combining four targets in the form of the new Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV assay was evaluated. The assay was compared to the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV, Seegene Flu/RSV, influenza A/B r-gene® and RSV/hMPV r-gene®. A total of 295 nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were tested at four institutes throughout Europe including 72 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2, 65 for influenza A, 47 for influenza B, and 77 for RSV. The sensitivity of the new assay was above 95% for all targets, with the highest for SARS-CoV-2 (97.2%). The overall correlation of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values between Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay and Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV assay was high. The agreement between Ct values above 30 showed the multiplex giving higher Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 on average than the singleplex assay. In conclusion, the new assay is a rapid and reliable alternative with less hands-on time for the detection of not one, but four upper respiratory tract pathogens that may circulate at the same time."
1395,The Dual/Global Value of SARS-CoV-2 Genome Surveillance on Migrants Arriving to Europe via the Mediterranean Routes.,"Despite the pandemic, 34,154 migrants, refugees or asylum-seekers landed in Sicily (Italy) in 2020, representing the main point of entry by sea into Europe. The SARS-CoV-2 surveillance program among migrants arriving to Sicily via the Mediterranean Sea, made by the combination of clinical examination and molecular testing, has been integrated by full-genome sequencing strains using the NGS technology from the last week of February. To date, more than one hundred full-genome strains have been sequenced and 8 different lineages have been identified mostly belonging to the lineages B.1.1.7 and B.1.525. As global access to COVID-19 vaccines should be ensured, the need to provide more detailed information to inform policies and to drive the possible re-engineering of vaccines needed to deal with the challenge of new and future variants should be highlighted."
1396,"Innate immunity, inflammation activation and heat-shock protein in COVID-19 pathogenesis.","SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 is a serious pandemic of the 21st century, which has caused a devastating loss of lives and a global economic catastrophe. A successful vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has suffered a delay due to lack of substantial knowledge about its mechanisms of action. Understanding the innate immune system against SARS-CoV-2 and the role of heat shock proteins' (HSP) inhibiting and resolution of inflammatory pathways may provide information to the low SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates in Africa. In addition, bats being a host to different viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 possess a well specialized IFN-innate antiviral inflammatory response, showing no signs of disease or pro-inflammatory cytokine storm. We discuss the molecular pathways in COVID-19 with a focus on innate immunity, inflammation, HSP responses, and suggest appropriate candidates for therapeutic targets and The contribution of the innate immune system to the efficacy of mRNA or vector based Corona immunizations."
1397,How to choose the right real-time RT-PCR primer sets for the SARS-CoV-2 genome detection?,"Objectives: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an unprecedented need for rapid large-scale diagnostic testing to prompt clinical and public health interventions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays recommended by the World Health Organization are being used by clinical and public health laboratories and typically target regions of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) coding region. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. This study aimed to clarify the clinical performances of the primer/probe sets designed by US CDC and Charité/Berlin to help clinical laboratories in assay selection for SARS-CoV-2 routine detection. Methods: We compared the clinical performances of the recommended primer/probe sets using one hundred nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients who were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. An additional 30 ""pre-intervention screening"" samples from patients who were not suspected of COVID-19 were also included in this study. We also performed sequence alignment between 31064 European SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern genomes and the recommended primer/probe sets. Results: The present study demonstrates substantial differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection sensitivity among the primer/probe sets recommended by the World Health Organization especially for low-level viral loads. The alignment of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences reveals that the genetic diversity remains relatively low at the primer/probe binding sites. However, multiple nucleotide mismatches might contribute to false negatives. Conclusion: An understanding of the limitations depending on the targeted genes and primer/probe sets may influence the selection of molecular detection assays by clinical laboratories."
