6750,SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol Exhaled by Experimentally Infected Cynomolgus Monkeys.,"We analyzed size of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) aerosol particles shed by experimentally infected cynomolgus monkeys. Most exhaled particles were small, and virus was mainly released early during infection. By postinfection day 6, no virus was detected in breath, but air in the isolator contained large quantities of aerosolized virus."
6751,The potential use of ABO blood group system for risk stratification of COVID-19.,"ABO blood groups is a cheap and affordable test that can be immediately retrieved from COVID-19 patients at the diagnosis. There is increasing evidence that non-O blood groups have both higher susceptibility and higher severity of COVID-19 infections. The reason behind such relationship seems elusive. Regarding susceptibility, Non-O individuals have Anti-A antibodies which can prevent viral entry across ACE-2 receptors, moreover, Non-O individuals are at higher risk of autoimmunity, hypercoagulable state, and dysbiosis resulting in an augmented tendency for vascular inflammatory sequelae of COVID-19. We can conclude, on the diagnostic level, that ABO blood groups can be potentially used for risk stratification of affected COVID-19 patients, to anticipate the deterioration of patients at higher risk for complications. On a therapeutic level, plasma from normal O blood group individuals might potentially replace the use of convalescent serum for the treatment of COVID-19."

6753,The interplay between emerging human coronavirus infections and autophagy.,"ABSTRACT Following outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2002 and 2012, respectively, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third highly pathogenic emerging human coronavirus (hCoV). SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CoV infections in target cells may stimulate the formation of numerous double-membrane autophagosomes and induce autophagy. Several studies provided evidence that hCoV infections are closely related to various cellular aspects associated with autophagy. Autophagy may even promote hCoV infection and replication. However, so far it is unclear how hCoV infections induce autophagy and whether the autophagic machinery is necessary for viral propagation. Here, we summarize the most recent advances concerning the mutual interplay between the autophagic machinery and the three emerging hCoVs, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 and the model system mouse hepatitis virus. We also discuss the applicability of approved and well-tolerated drugs targeting autophagy as a potential treatment against COVID-19."

6755,Consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the perinatal period.,"Purpose of review: To provide an update on the consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infection on the health and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women and their infants. Recent findings: The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is greater in pregnant compared to nonpregnant women as measured by rates of admission to intensive care units, mechanical ventilation, mortality, and morbidities including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolic and other thrombotic events, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and preterm birth. The risk of transmission from mother-to-infant is relatively low (1.5-5%) as quantitated by neonatal SARS-CoV-2 testing. Infants appear to be at higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 if the mother has tested positive within 1 week of delivery or is herself symptomatic at the time of maternity admission. The rate of positivity is not higher in infants who room in with the mother compared to infants who are initially separated and cared for in a SARS-CoV-2-free environment. Infants who test positive in the hospital have no or mild signs of disease, most of which may be attributable to prematurity, and rarely require readmission for clinical signs consistent with COVID-19. Summary: Pregnant women should take precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. Infants born to mothers who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 can receive normal neonatal care in-hospital with their mothers if mother and staff adhere to recommended infection control practices."
6756,The level of protective post-vaccination antibodies in NIPH-NIH employees after administration of Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19.,"Introduction: The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, first recognized in China in 2019, within a few months caused a global pandemic of a disease called COVID-19. The high incidence and mortality of COVID-19 was the reason for the beginning of intensive work on the development of an effective vaccine. In Poland, mass vaccinations against this disease began at the end of December 2020. Objectives: The aim of the presented study was to determine the effectiveness of stimulating the production of specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 by the Pfizer vaccine. Material and methods: The presence of IgA and IgG antibodies to the spike (S protein) of SARSCoV-2 was tested by the ELISA/Euroimmun in serum samples obtained from 140 the employees of NIPH-NIH (137 were vaccinated). In addition, the presence of IgG antibodies to S protein, nucleoprotein, and mixture of both in selected serum samples was tested by the newly developed in NIPH-NIH in-house ELISA assay. Results: IgA and IgG antibodies to the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 were detected by ELISA/Euroimmun, respectively in 136 and in all 137 vaccinated persons. There were no statistically significant differences in the level of antibodies depending on the sex and age of the vaccinated persons. Slightly higher levels of antibodies have been demonstrated in vaccinated subjects with documented preexisting SARS-CoV-2 immunity compared to subjects without COVID-19 history. The presence of IgA and IgG antibodies was found in respectively, 18 (45.0%) and all 40 (100.0%) tested vaccinated persons by the in-house ELISA with mixture antigen. The study showed that ELISA assay with N protein as an antigen may enable the distinction between antibodies acquired after infection and after vaccination. Conclusions: The results obtained in the presented study clearly demonstrate the high effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine in stimulation of the human immune system to produce antibodies specific for the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2. It is necessary to continue testing vaccine antibody levels at various times after vaccination to determine the potential duration of humoral immunity."
6757,[CME: Hypertension and the COVID-19 Pandemic: What to Consider in Medical Practice].,"CME: Hypertension and the COVID-19 Pandemic: What to Consider in Medical Practice Abstract. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health problem. A fraction of the population is at increased risk of developing complications of this disease, in particular older subjects as well as diabetic, obese and hypertensive patients. With regard to patients with high blood pressure, the existence of an increased risk remains to be confirmed in large controlled trials. So far the findings regarding this question are reassuring, whether these patients are treated or not. There seems to be no reason to worry when using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. The observations available to date suggest that COVID-19 vaccine can be administered safely to hypertensive patients. In conclusion, there is no reason to implement changes in the care of hypertensive patients due to the pandemic."
6758,18F-FDG PET/CT Metabolic Behavior of COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Series of 4 Patients With RT-PCR Confirmation.,"Between March 26 and April 6, among 80 patients who underwent F-FDG PET/CT in our department (Brescia, Italy), 4 showed the presence of an interstitial pneumonia suspected for COVID-19 with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmation. All patients except one had bilateral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in at least 2 pulmonary lobes. Inferior lobes and basal segments were the most frequent site of disease. All lung lesions had an increased FDG uptake corresponding to the interstitial pneumonia, and in one case, mediastinal nodal involvement was registered."
6759,Pharmacotherapy of atrial fibrillation in COVID-19 patients.,"The coronavirus pandemic disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed the face of contemporary medicine. However, each and every medical practitioner must be aware of potential early and late complications of COVID-19, its impact on chronic diseases - especially ones as common as atrial fibrillation (AF) - and the possible interactions between patients' chronic medications and pharmacotherapy of COVID-19. Patients with AF due to comorbidities and, often, elderly age are assumed to be at a higher risk of a severe course of COVID-19. This expert consensus summarizes the current knowledge regarding the pharmacotherapy of AF patients in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, anticoagulation principles in quarantined or asymptomatic individuals remain unchanged. Nevertheless, it is advisable to switch from vitamin K antagonists to non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) whenever possible due to their consistent benefits and safety with fixed dosing and no monitoring. Additionally, in AF patients hospitalized due to mild or moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, we recommend continuing NOAC treatment or to switching to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). On the other hand, in severely ill patients hospitalized in intensive care units, intravenous or subcutaneous dosing is preferable to oral, which is why the treatment of choice is either LMWH or unfractionated heparin. Finally, particularly in critical scenarios, the treatment strategy in COVID-19 patients with AF should be individualized based on possible interactions between anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, antivirals, and antibiotics. In this consensus, we also discuss how to safely perform COVID-19 vaccination in anticoagulated AF patients."
