7290,"COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 20 (Fortnightly reporting period ending 5 July 2020).","Notified cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) to 5 July 2020. Cumulative confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 5 July 2020: notifications = 8,566, deaths = 106. Over the past fortnightly reporting period (22 June to 5 July), 897 cases were notified, with 4 deaths. The national incidence of COVID-19 remained low, with very few cases reported by most jurisdictions in this reporting period. The majority of the current cases reported over this fortnight are from Victoria, with an increasing number and proportion of cases reported as being locally acquired. Total case numbers have increased with an average of 54 cases reported on any one day, more than twice the average number reported in the previous reporting period. The number and proportion of deaths associated with COVID-19 remains low and it appears that vulnerable populations have not been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 overall. Testing rates continue to be high across all jurisdictions, with the nationwide positivity rate remaining very low at less than 0.3%. In this reporting period, the number of cases reported nationally has increased from 214 (8 June to 21 June) to 897 (22 June to 5 July). Of the cases notified in this reporting period, 87% (781 cases) were notified from Victoria and 89% of these cases were acquired locally. Of the remaining 116 cases reported from other jurisdictions only 6% were locally acquired. The increase in Victoria is attributable to multiple epidemiologically linked outbreaks across a range of settings and locations. A small proportion of cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care, with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.2%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease."
7291,Increasing SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing capacity during the COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing: experience from a general hospital.,"Under the ongoing COVID-19 prevention and control measures in China, increasing the laboratory severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid testing capacity has become the top priority. Since the COVID-19 outbreak in Xinfadi market in Beijing in June 2020, large-scale screening of key populations has been carried out, challenging the nucleic acid testing capabilities of hospital laboratories. Therefore, within 48 hours, Peking University People's Hospital (PKUPH) transformed a non-nucleic acid testing laboratory into a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing laboratory. Based on the original structure of the building, we adapted measures to local conditions, sorted out a new testing process, and quickly started testing for COVID-19. The nucleic acid testing process has been optimized, including quality control, personal operating specifications, and the timeliness of the release of LIS results to form closed-loop management. This high-throughput COVID-19 testing optimization process provides a reference model for other countries that are fighting the epidemic."

7293,"Primary Symptoms, Comorbidities, and Outcomes of 431 Hospitalized Patients with Confirmative RT-PCR Results for COVID-19.","This study aimed to evaluate the primary symptoms, comorbidities, and outcomes of inpatients with confirmed reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 infection among 2077 suspected/diagnosed cases of COVID-19. Based on the results of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression, age, and suggestive chest X-ray (CXR) findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases, and intensive care units admission had significant associations with positive RT-PCR results for COVID-19 infection. Also, the highest area under the curve (AUC) was related to cough (AUC = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.51-0.56), dyspnea (AUC = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.50-0.54), and abnormal CXR (AUC = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.50-0.54), as significant predictors. This study showed that some symptoms including cough and dyspnea, as well as abnormal CXR, could be proper predictors of positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 infection. It seems that patients with underlying disease(s), such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and chronic lung diseases, had a higher probability to have positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection than those with no underlying disease(s)."
7294,Ultrastructure of cell trafficking pathways and coronavirus: how to recognise the wolf amongst the sheep.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in an urgent need to understand the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, to assist in the identification of treatment strategies. Viral tissue tropism is an active area of investigation, one approach to which is identification of virus within tissues by electron microscopy of post-mortem and surgical specimens. Most diagnostic histopathologists have limited understanding of the ultrastructural features of normal cell trafficking pathways, which can resemble intra- and extracellular coronavirus; in addition, viral replication pathways make use of these trafficking pathways. Herein, we review these pathways and their ultrastructural appearances, with emphasis on structures which may be confused with coronavirus. In particular, we draw attention to the fact that, when using routine fixation and processing, the typical 'crown' that characterises a coronavirus is not readily identified on intracellular virions, which are located in membrane-bound vacuoles. In addition, the viral nucleocapsid is seen as black dots within the virion and is more discriminatory in differentiating virions from other cellular structures. The identification of the viral replication organelle, a collection of membranous structures (convoluted membranes) seen at a relatively low scanning power, may help to draw attention to infected cells, which can be sparse. © 2020 The Authors.

7295,Efficacy and Safety of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine.,"Background: Vaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to protect persons who are at high risk for complications. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. Methods: This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 μg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results: The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups. Conclusions: The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease. Aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified.

7296,Necessity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in multiple types of specimens for the discharge of the patients with COVID-19.,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected positive again after discharged from hospital in some COVID-19 patients, with or without clinical symptoms such as fever or dry cough. Methods: 1008 severe COVID-19 patients, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive detected with the mixed specimen of nasopharyngeal swab and oropharyngeal swab by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), were selected to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA with the 12 types of specimens by RT-qPCR during hospitalization. All of 20 discharged cases with COVID-19 were selected to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in isolation period with 7 types of specimens by RT-qPCR before releasing the isolation period. Results: Of the enrolled 1008 severe patients, the nasopharyngeal swab specimens showed the highest positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (71.06%), followed by alveolar lavage fluid (66.67%), oropharyngeal swab (30.77%), sputum (28.53%), urine (16.30%), blood (12.5%), stool (12.21%), anal swab (11.22%) and corneal secretion (2.99%), and SARS-CoV-2 RNA couldn't be detected in other types of specimen in this study. Of the 20 discharged cases during the isolation period, the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 30% (6/20): 2 cases were positive in sputum at the eighth and ninth day after discharge, respectively, 1 case was positive in nasopharynx swab at the sixth day after discharge, 1 case was positive in anal swab at the eighth day after discharge, and 1 case was positive in 3 specimens (nasopharynx swab, oropharynx swab and sputum) simultaneously at the fourth day after discharge, and no positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in other specimens including stool, urine and blood at the discharged patients. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be detected in multiple specimens, such as nasopharynx swab, oropharynx swab, sputum, and if necessary, stool and anal swab specimens should be performed simultaneously at discharge when the patients were considered for clinical cure and before releasing the isolation period."

7298,Astemizole as a drug to inhibit the effect of SARS-COV-2 in vitro.,"Since the beginning of December 2019, a novel Coronavirus severe respiratory disease, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which also been termed 2019-new CoV (2019-nCoV), has continued to spread worldwide. As of August 27, 2020, a total of 24,232,429 people have been infected and 826,518 people have died. In our study, we found that astemizole can antagonize ACE2 and inhibit the entry of SARS-COV-2 spike pseudovirus into ACE2-expressed HEK293T cells (ACE2hi cells). We analysied the binding character of astemizole to ACE2 by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays and molecule docking, SARS-COV-2 spike pseudotype virus was also taken to investigate the suppression viropexis effect of astemizole. The results showed that astemizole can bind to the ACE2 receptor and inhibit the invasion of SARS-COV-2 Spike pseudoviruses. Thus astemizole represent potential drug candidates that can be re-used in anti-coronavirus therapies."
7299,Global and local mutations in Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 genomes.,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) warrants comprehensive investigations of publicly available Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes to gain new insight about their epidemiology, mutations, and pathogenesis. Nearly 0.4 million mutations have been identified so far among the ∼60,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. In this study, we compared a total of 371 SARS-CoV-2 published whole genomes reported from different parts of Bangladesh with 467 sequences reported globally to understand the origin of viruses, possible patterns of mutations, and availability of unique mutations. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that SARS-CoV-2 viruses might have transmitted through infected travelers from European countries, and the GR clade was found as predominant in Bangladesh. Our analyses revealed 4604 mutations at the RNA level including 2862 missense mutations, 1192 synonymous mutations, 25 insertions and deletions and 525 other types of mutation. In line with the global trend, D614G mutation in spike glycoprotein was predominantly high (98 %) in Bangladeshi isolates. Interestingly, we found the average number of mutations in ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, M, and N were significantly higher (p < 0.001) for sequences containing the G614 variant compared to those having D614. Previously reported frequent mutations, such as R203K, D614G, G204R, P4715L and I300F at protein levels were also prevalent in Bangladeshi isolates. Additionally, 34 unique amino acid changes were revealed and categorized as originating from different cities. These analyses may increase our understanding of variations in SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes, circulating in Bangladesh and elsewhere."
