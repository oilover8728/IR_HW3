1110,An optimized stepwise algorithm combining rapid antigen and RT-qPCR for screening of COVID-19 patients.,"Background & aim: We investigated the combination of rapid antigen detection (RAD) and RT-qPCR assays in a stepwise procedure to optimize the detection of COVID-19. Methods: From August 2020 to November 2020, 43,399 patients were screened in our laboratory for COVID-19 diagnostic by RT-qPCR using nasopharyngeal swab. Overall, 4,691 of the 43,399 were found to be positive, and 200 were retrieved for RAD testing allowing comparison of diagnostic accuracy between RAD and RT-qPCR. Cycle threshold (Ct) and time from symptoms onset (TSO) were included as covariates. Results: The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR-, and LR+ of RAD compared with RT-qPCR were 72% (95%CI 62%-81%), 99% (95% CI95%-100%), 99% (95%CI 93%-100%), and 78% (95%CI 70%-85%), 0.28 (95%CI 0.21-0.39), and 72 (95%CI 10-208) respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with Ct ≤ 25 regardless of TSO: TSO ≤ 4 days 92% (95%CI 75%-99%), TSO > 4 days 100% (95%CI 54%-100%), and asymptomatic 100% (95%CI 78-100%). Overall, combining RAD and RT-qPCR would allow reducing from only 4% the number of RT-qPCR needed. Conclusions: This study highlights the risk of misdiagnosing COVID-19 in 28% of patients if RAD is used alone. A stepwise analysis that combines RAD and RT-qPCR would be an efficient screening procedure for COVID-19 detection and may facilitate the control of the outbreak."
1111,"Retest positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA of ""recovered"" patients with COVID-19: Persistence, sampling issues, or re-infection?","""Retest Positive"" for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from ""recovered"" coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has been reported and raised several important questions for this novel coronavirus and COVID-19 disease. In this commentary, we discussed several questions: (a) Can SARS-CoV-2 re-infect the individuals who recovered from COVID-19? This question is also associated with other questions: whether or not SARS-CoV-2 infection induces protective reaction or neutralized antibody? Will SARS-CoV-2 vaccines work? (b) Why could some recovered patients with COVID-19 be re-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA? (c) Are some recovered pwith atients COVID-19 with re-testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA infectious? and (d) How should the COVID-19 patients with retest positive for SARS-CoV-2 be managed?"
1112,Genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in Egypt.,"Introduction: The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout the globe, causing a pandemic. In Egypt over 115,000 individuals were infected so far. Objective: In the present study, the objective is to perform a complete genome sequence of SAR-CoV2 isolated from Egyptian coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 61 COVID-19 patients who attended at National Cancer Institute, Kasr Al-Aini Hospital and the army hospital. Viral RNA was extracted and whole genomic sequencing was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing. Results: In all cases, the sequenced virus has at least 99% identity to the reference Wuhan 1. The sequence analysis showed 204 distinct genome variations including 114 missense mutations, 72 synonymous mutations, 1 disruptive in-frame deletion, 7 downstream gene mutations, 6 upstream gene mutations, 3 frame-shift deletions, and 1 in-frame deletion. The most dominant clades were G/GH/GR/O and the dominant type is B. Conclusion: The whole genomic sequence of SARS-CoV2 showed 204 variations in the genomes of the Egyptian isolates, where the Asp614Gly (D614G) substitution is the most common among the samples (60/61). So far, there were no strikingly variations specific to the Egyptian population, at least for this set of samples."
1113,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) universal screening in gravids during labor and delivery.,"Objective: To screen pregnant women at risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during delivery using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) testing. Method: Between March 31 st and August 31 st of 2020, consecutive pregnant women admitted for labor and delivery in a single hospital were screened for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab tests and detection of serum IgG and IgM. Results: We studied 266 pregnant women admitted for labor and delivery. The prevalence of acute or past SARS-CoV-2 infection was 9.0 %, including (i) two cases with respiratory symptoms of SARS-Co-V-2 infection and positive RT-PCR; (ii) four asymptomatic women with positive RT-PCR without clinical symptoms and negative serological tests between two and 15 weeks later; and (iii) two women with false positive RT-PCR due to technical problems. All newborns of the 6 pregnant women with RT-PCR positive had negative RT-PCR and did not require Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission. There were eighteen asymptomatic women with positive serological IgG tests and negative RT-PCR. Conclusion: In our cohort of gravids, we found 2.2 % of women with positive RT-PRC tests and 6.7 % with positive serological tests during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."
1114,COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) in patients with multiple sclerosis: a statement by a working group convened by the Section of Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology of the Polish Neurological Society.,"A working group convened by the Section of Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology of the Polish Neurological Society has developed a statement with regard to the currently available mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) preventing novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) infection, which causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). This statement has been based on the literature available as of 15 January, 2021. The guidance will be updated as new data emerges. All data regarding the above-mentioned vaccines comes from clinical trials which have been reviewed, published and approved by the regulatory authorities [1, 2]. In the current manuscript, whenever a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is discussed, it refers to mRNA vaccines only."
1115,"A 10-Minute ""Mix and Read"" Antibody Assay for SARS-CoV-2.","Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are needed for management of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Antibody tests enable detection of individuals past the initial phase of infection and help examine vaccine responses. The major targets of human antibody response in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the spike glycoprotein (SP) and nucleocapsid protein (NP). We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal. We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against SP and NP and evaluated their diagnostic performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described SP and a novel NP construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 SP and NP. We then compared the LFRET assays with these ELISAs and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT). We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90-95% vs. 90-100%) and specificity (100% vs. 94-100%). In identifying individuals with or without a detectable neutralizing antibody response, LFRET outperformed ELISA in specificity (91-96% vs. 82-87%), while demonstrating an equal sensitivity (98%). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the applicability of LFRET, a 10-min ""mix and read"" assay, to detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies."
1116,Clinical significance of measuring serum cytokine levels as inflammatory biomarkers in adult and pediatric COVID-19 cases: A review.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly evolving infectious/inflammatory disorder which has turned into a global pandemic. With severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as its etiologic agent, severe COVID-19 cases usually develop uncontrolled inflammatory responses and cytokine storm-like syndromes. Measuring serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and others) as inflammatory biomarkers may have several potential applications in the management of COVID-19, including risk assessment, monitoring of disease progression, determination of prognosis, selection of therapy and prediction of response to treatment.This is especially true for pediatric patients with COVID-19 associated Kawasaki-like disease and similar syndromes. In this report, we review the current knowledge of COVID-19 associated cytokines, their roles in host immune and inflammatory responses, the clinical significance and utility of cytokine immunoassays in adult and pediatric COVID-19 patients, as well as the challenges and pitfalls in implementation and interpretation of cytokine immunoassays. Given that cytokines are implicated in different immunological disorders and diseases, it is challenging to interpret the multiplex cytokine data for COVID-19 patients. Also, it should be taken into consideration that biological and technical variables may affect the commutability of cytokine immunoassays and enhance complexity of cytokine immunoassay interpretation. It is recommended that the same method, platform and laboratory should be used when monitoring differences in cytokine levels between groups of individuals or for the same individual over time. It may be important to correlate cytokine profiling data with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing and imaging observations to make an accurate interpretation of the inflammatory status and disease progression in COVID-19 patients."
1117,"Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant Infections Among Incarcerated Persons in a Federal Prison - Texas, July-August 2021.","Incarcerated populations have experienced disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19-related illness and death compared with the general U.S. population, due in part to congregate living environments that can facilitate rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and the high prevalence of underlying medical conditions associated with severe COVID-19 (1,2). The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant has caused outbreaks among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons in congregate settings and large public gatherings (3,4). During July 2021, a COVID-19 outbreak involving the Delta variant was identified in a federal prison in Texas, infecting 172 of 233 (74%) incarcerated persons in two housing units. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) partnered with CDC to investigate. CDC analyzed data on infection status, symptom onset date, hospitalizations, and deaths among incarcerated persons. The attack rate was higher among unvaccinated versus fully vaccinated persons (39 of 42, 93% versus 129 of 185, 70%; p = 0.002).† Four persons were hospitalized, three of whom were unvaccinated, and one person died, who was unvaccinated. Among a subset of 70 persons consenting to an embedded serial swabbing protocol, the median interval between symptom onset and last positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result in fully vaccinated versus unvaccinated persons was similar (9 versus 11 days, p = 0.37). One or more specimens were culture-positive from five of 12 (42%) unvaccinated and 14 of 37 (38%) fully vaccinated persons for whom viral culture was attempted. In settings where physical distancing is challenging, including correctional and detention facilities, vaccination and implementation of multicomponent prevention strategies (e.g., testing, medical isolation, quarantine, and masking) are critical to limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission (5)."

1119,SARS-CoV-2 Antigenemia as a Confounding Factor in Immunodiagnostic Assays: A Case Study.,"Humoral immunity has emerged as a vital immune component against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Nevertheless, a subset of recovered Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) paucisymptomatic/asymptomatic individuals do not generate an antibody response, constituting a paradox. We assumed that immunodiagnostic assays may operate under a competitive format within the context of antigenemia, potentially explaining this phenomenon. We present a case where persistent antigenemia/viremia was documented for at least 73 days post-symptom onset using 'in-house' methodology, and as it progressively declined, seroconversion took place late, around day 55, supporting our hypothesis. Thus, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia/viremia could mask humoral responses, rendering, in certain cases, the phenomenon of 'non-responders' a misnomer."
