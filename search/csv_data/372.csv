3710,Implementation of a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination Condition of Employment in a Community Nursing Home.,"The rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination uptake by US nursing home staff remains low despite the increased risks of viral transmission and related morbidity and mortality in this setting. This study describes vaccine uptake activities including a COVID-19 vaccination condition of employment (COE) policy in one community nursing home. This case study summarizes the timeline of vaccination uptake activities, staff vaccination rates over time, and stakeholder perspectives around the implementation of a COVID-19 vaccination COE. Organizational data were used to calculate vaccination rates from January 1, 2021 until May 1, 2021 among all nursing home staff. Interviews were held with the executive leadership team, human resources leadership, and nursing home staff to understand the process of implementation. During a 4-month period, nursing home leaders provided 8 written handouts about COVID-19 to all staff, hosted 5 on-site vaccination clinics in partnership with area pharmacies, conducted 2 virtual presentations for staff in addition to individual outreach and internal communications. Fewer than one-half of the staff were vaccinated prior to the decision to pursue a vaccine COE on February 9, 2021. The decision to pursue a COVID-19 vaccination COE was supported by executive leadership and nursing home staff to protect the health and safety of each other and their residents. By May 1, 2021 a total of 221 of the 246 (89.8%) nursing home staff members received a COVID-19 vaccination. The facility reached 100% compliance with the vaccination COE policy with 18 people who chose to resign and 7 people who were exempt or on a leave of absence. In combination with frequent, personalized outreach, a COVID-19 vaccination COE resulted in high staff vaccination rates and minimal staff turnover. This case study provides a detailed summary of vaccination uptake activities within an organizational context to inform efforts at other healthcare facilities."
3711,"Characteristics of Clinically Asymptomatic Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infections, Case Series.","Up until now, there is much debate about the role of asymptomatic patients and pauci-symptomatic patients in severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, and little is known about the kinetics of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) shedding in these populations. This article aims to describe key features and the nature of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The cohort consisted of six participants, three pairs, which were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during February 2020 on board the Diamond Princess. Of the six confirmed (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) cases, four were initially diagnosed in Japan and two upon their arrival to Israel. Duration of infection was between four days and up to 26 days. Of the six patients, three were completely asymptomatic and the others were pauci-symptomatic. All five patients in whom a computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed had lung pathology. In one patient, infectivity was tested using cell culture and a cytopathic effect was demonstrated. A serology test was performed in three of the patients and all three had a positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) four to eight weeks after disease onset. This case series demonstrates that asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic patients may play a role in infection transmission by demonstrating probable transmission among asymptomatic spouses and by demonstrating a viable virus via a cell culture. Additionally, asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic patients can have lung pathology and developing IgG antibodies."

3714,Dye-Loaded Polymersome-Based Lateral Flow Assay: Rational Design of a COVID-19 Testing Platform by Repurposing SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Cocktail and Antigens Obtained from Positive Human Samples.,"The global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to be an important threat, especially with the fast transmission rate observed after the discovery of novel mutations. In this perspective, prompt diagnosis requires massive economical and human resources to mitigate the disease. The current study proposes a rational design of a colorimetric lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) based on the repurposing of human samples to produce COVID-19-specific antigens and antibodies in combination with a novel dye-loaded polymersome for naked-eye detection. A group of 121 human samples (61 serums and 60 nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by RT-PCR and ELISA. Pooled samples were used to purify antibodies using affinity chromatography, while antigens were purified via magnetic nanoparticles-based affinity. The purified proteins were confirmed for their specificity to COVID-19 via commercial LFA, ELISA, and electrochemical tests in addition to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Polymersomes were prepared using methoxy polyethylene glycol-b-polycaprolactone (mPEG-b-PCL) diblock copolymers and loaded with a Coomassie Blue dye. The polymersomes were then functionalized with the purified antibodies and applied for the preparation of two types of LFA (antigen test and antibody test). Overall, the proposed diagnostic tests demonstrated 93 and 92.2% sensitivity for antigen and antibody tests, respectively. The repeatability (92-94%) and reproducibility (96-98%) of the tests highlight the potential of the proposed LFA. The LFA test was also analyzed for stability, and after 4 weeks, 91-97% correct diagnosis was observed. The current LFA platform is a valuable assay that has great economical and analytical potential for widespread applications."
3715,Sample pooling on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented global demand on laboratory supplies required for testing. Sample pooling has been investigated by laboratories as a strategy to preserve testing capacity. We evaluate the performance of Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for testing samples in pools of 4 and 6. Clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2, and confirmed negative clinical samples were used to create sample pools. Clinical samples had 'neat' Xpert® E gene cycle threshold values ranging between 20 and 28 and all were detected qualitatively when contained in pools of 4 or 6 samples. For these samples, pooling had a median change in cycle threshold value of 2.0 in pools of 4, and of 2.9 in pools of 6. With the use of Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, pooling of 4 or 6 samples may be an effective strategy to increase testing capacity."
3716,How Did We Get a COVID-19 Vaccine in Less Than 1 Year?,"The successful development of COVID-19 vaccines within an unprecedented short time needs to be followed by rapid vaccine uptake, in particular, in high-risk populations such as patients with cancer. It is important for the scientific research community and cancer physicians to convey the knowledge behind the COVID-19 vaccine development and contribute to build the required trust on their use."
3717,Protocol for the economic evaluation of COVID-19 pandemic response policies.,"Introduction: Several treatment options are available for COVID-19 to date. However, the use of a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is necessary for jurisdictions to contain its spread. Although the implementation cost of NPIs may be low from the healthcare system perspective, it can be costly when considering the indirect costs from the societal perspective. COVID-19 vaccination campaigns have begun in several countries worldwide. Nonetheless, the quantity of vaccines available remain limited over the next 1 to 2 years. A tool for informing vaccine prioritisation that considers both cost and effectiveness will be highly useful. This study aims to identify the most cost-effective combination of COVID-19 response policies, using Singapore as an example. Methods and analysis: An age-stratified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model will be used to generate the number of infections stratified by disease severity under different intervention scenarios. Polices of interest include test-trace-isolate, travel restriction, compulsory face mask and hygiene practices, social distancing, dexamethasone/remdesivir therapy and vaccination. The latest phase 3 trial results and the WHO Target Product Profiles for COVID-19 vaccines will be used to model vaccine characteristics. A cost (expected resource utilisation and productivity losses) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be attached to these outputs for a cost-utility analysis. The primary outcome measure will be the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio generated from the incremental cost of policy alternatives expressed as a ratio of the incremental benefits (QALYs gained). Efficacy of policy options will be gathered from literature review and from its observed impacts in Singapore. Cost data will be gathered from healthcare institutions, Ministry of Health and published data. Sensitivity analysis such as threshold analysis and scenario analysis will be conducted. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was not required for this study. The study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals."

Through a simple email survey, we arrived at a 14% dropout rate during the days following vaccination. We explored options to anticipate dropout during following vaccination rounds and advocate transparency with regard to the side effects."
