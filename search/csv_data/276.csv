2750,Pooled testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in an automated high-throughput platform.,"Background: Active detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection through testing is elementary for the control of COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of large-scale RT-PCR testing has led to a rise in the demand for testing kits whose availability is always a concern. Objective: To find out the feasibility of pooled testing in a high-throughput platform. Methodology: Pooled testing was conducted in Roche cobas 6800 in 2 methods. Firstly, the simple two-stage testing algorithm was conducted for 1410 samples individually and then as pooled samples. Secondly, we evaluated the sensitivity of cobas 6800 for the detection of a single positive sample within a pool of negative samples. Results: Implementing the five-sample Dorfman pooling to test 1410 samples, we identified 42 (2.9%) individual SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and 27 (9.5%) positive pool samples. The pooling strategy precisely identified all the positive samples. All individually negative samples were also accurately determined by pooling. There was 100% sensitivity of detecting positive samples in a pool of negative samples even up to 1:64 dilution. There was a threefold increase in total throughput in one-third of the cost per day. Conclusion: A high-throughput platform such as Cobas 6800 can effectively increase the testing capacity by twofold to threefold by adopting the pooled testing strategy for successful management of SARS-CoV-2 and helping in the containment of community transmission."

2752,COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients-Where we are?,"In late December 2019, China reported cases of respiratory illness in humans that involved a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. On March 20, 2020, the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Brazil was diagnosed, and by now, we present the report on the first case of COVID among transplant recipients in our country. A liver and kidney transplant patient with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without respiratory failure was treated in a clinical multimodal strategy consisting of symptomatic support therapy, immunosuppression reduction, use of anti-coronavirus drugs and heparin leading to a progressive improvement of patient symptoms till discharge. The authors also present a comprehensive review of published cases."
2753,COVID-19 Testing in the Era of Modern Neurosurgery: Mitigating Risk in Our Vulnerable Patient Populations.,"Background: The respiratory illness identified as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a pandemic illness that has changed the face of healthcare. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, patients have continued to require neurosurgical interventions, and the endoscopic endonasal approach for surgery has continued to be a mainstay treatment of pituitary tumors and anterior skull base lesions. Methods: We sought to highlight the current lack of recommendations regarding testing protocols for neurosurgical patients. Results: We implemented a novel testing protocol for our patient populations at increased risk and have proposed a model that can be used at other institutions to mitigate the risk of complications associated with some forms of COVID-19 testing. Conclusion: Patients with anterior skull base defects may be at risk with current COVID-19 testing protocols, and may benefit from alternative specimen collection strategies."

2755,Laboratory verification of an RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is an extremely common clinical method for detecting pathogens, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Currently, detection of the RNA from the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the gold standard for establishing a COVID-19 diagnosis. This study evaluates the characteristic performance of the analytical system in a clinical laboratory. Methods: A commercial SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR Kit used in a clinical laboratory is assessed based on ISO 15189 verification requirements. A multiple real-time RT-PCR assay for the RdRP, N, and E genes in SARS-CoV-2 is verified. Results: The analytical system exhibits good analytical sensitivity (1000 copies/mL) and specificity (100%); however, the values of 86.7% and 100% for analytical accuracy deserved attention, compared with two other types of methods. Overall, the kit is potentially useful for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing and meets the verification requirements. Conclusion: Compliance with international standards, such as ISO 15189, is valuable for clinical laboratories and for improving laboratory medicine quality and safety. Normalization is essential for obtaining reliable results from the SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR assay. This study aims to develop an improved SARS-CoV-2 verification framework compared with traditional molecular diagnostic methods, given the urgency of implementing new assays in clinical laboratories."

2758,Phenol-chloroform-based RNA purification for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR: Comparison with automated systems.,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly reached pandemic levels. Sufficient testing for SARS-CoV-2 has remained essential for tracking and containing the virus. SARS-CoV-2 testing capabilities are still limited in many countries. Here, we explore the use of conventional RNA purification as an alternative to automated systems for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. 87 clinical swab specimens were extracted by conventional phenol-chloroform RNA purification and compared to commercial platforms for RNA extraction and the fully integrated Cobas®6800 diagnostic system. Our results show that the conventional RNA extraction is fully comparable to modern automated systems regarding analytical sensitivity and specificity with respect to detection of SARS-CoV-2 as evaluated by RT-qPCR. Moreover, the method is easily scalable and implemented in conventional laboratories as a low cost and suitable alternative to automated systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2."
2759,SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and subsequent infection risk in healthy young adults: a prospective cohort study.,"Background: Whether young adults who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of subsequent infection is uncertain. We investigated the risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection among young adults seropositive for a previous infection. Methods: This analysis was performed as part of the prospective COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines study (CHARM). CHARM included predominantly male US Marine recruits, aged 18-20 years, following a 2-week unsupervised quarantine at home. After the home quarantine period, upon arrival at a Marine-supervised 2-week quarantine facility (college campus or hotel), participants were enrolled and were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a dilution of 1:150 or more on receptor-binding domain and full-length spike protein ELISA. Participants also completed a questionnaire consisting of demographic information, risk factors, reporting of 14 specific COVID-19-related symptoms or any other unspecified symptom, and brief medical history. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at weeks 0, 1, and 2 of quarantine and participants completed a follow-up questionnaire, which included questions about the same COVID-19-related symptoms since the last study visit. Participants were excluded at this stage if they had a positive PCR test during quarantine. Participants who had three negative swab PCR results during quarantine and a baseline serum serology test at the beginning of the supervised quarantine that identified them as seronegative or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 then went on to basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot-Parris Island. Three PCR tests were done at weeks 2, 4, and 6 in both seropositive and seronegative groups, along with the follow-up symptom questionnaire and baseline neutralising antibody titres on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants (prospective study period). Findings: Between May 11, 2020, and Nov 2, 2020, we enrolled 3249 participants, of whom 3168 (98%) continued into the 2-week quarantine period. 3076 (95%) participants, 2825 (92%) of whom were men, were then followed up during the prospective study period after quarantine for 6 weeks. Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the 6-week follow-up (1·1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1079 (48%) of 2247 seronegative participants tested positive (6·2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0·18 (95% CI 0·11-0·28; p<0·001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was more likely with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres than in those with higher baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres (hazard ratio 0·45 [95% CI 0·32-0·65]; p<0·001). Infected seropositive participants had viral loads that were about 10-times lower than those of infected seronegative participants (ORF1ab gene cycle threshold difference 3·95 [95% CI 1·23-6·67]; p=0·004). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralising titres were detected in 45 (83%) of 54 uninfected and in six (32%) of 19 infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<0·0001). Interpretation: Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation activity or immunity against subsequent infection. These findings might be relevant for optimisation of mass vaccination strategies. Funding: Defense Health Agency and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency."
