8990,Fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2: review of laboratory-confirmed virus in gastrointestinal system.,"Purpose: The objective was to collect the data available regarding the presence of laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in gastrointestinal system and to evaluate whether the digestive system could contribute to viral transmission. Methods: Bibliographic databases were searched to identify all studies documenting, in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): (1) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the feces; (2) the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the intestinal cells; (3) live SARS-CoV-2 in the feces. Results: Twenty seven met the inclusion criteria. In 26 studies, the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the feces of COVID-19 patients had been reported. Out of the 671 patients, 312 (46.5%) had a positive stool sample for viral nucleic acid. Of these patients, 63.9% remained positive for viral nucleic acid in the feces after pharyngeal swabs became negative; Three studies also evaluated the viral ribonucleic acid in the gastrointestinal tissues and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was found in samples of 3 patients out of 8 examined (37.5%). The presence of the live virus in stool samples was confirmed in two studies but no in in a recent study from Germany. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect gastrointestinal epithelial cells and it may be transmitted through the digestive tract. Conclusion: In order to control the pandemic, every effort should be made to understand all the possible routes of transmission of the infections, even the less important ones."
8991,"Novel Mutation of SARS-CoV-2, Vietnam, July 2020.","A cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in Danang, Vietnam, began July 25, 2020, and resulted in 551 confirmed cases and 35 deaths as of February 2021. We analyzed 26 sequences from this cluster and identified a novel shared mutation in nonstructural protein 9, suggesting a single introduction into Vietnam."
8992,"Detection, Mapping, and Proteotyping of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus with High Resolution Mass Spectrometry.","A high resolution mass spectrometry approach has been applied for the first time to detect and characterize SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in cell cultured and nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Peptide ions for three of the most abundant structural viral proteins (membrane, nucleocapid, and spike) are detected and assigned directly, by virtue of the high resolution and mass accuracy within the mass maps of whole virus digests, without the need for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). MALDI-MS based approaches offer high sample throughput and speed, compared with those of LC-MS strategies, and detection limits at some 105 copies, or orders of magnitude less with selected ion monitoring, that compete favorably with conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) strategies. The detection of signature peptides unique to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus over those from the influenza virus allows for its unambiguous detection."

8995,Validation Study for PathogenDx EnviroX-Rv Assay for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Stainless Steel Environmental Surface Swabs Performance Tested MethodSM 122003.,"Background: The PathogenDx EnviroX-Rv uses endpoint PCR + DNA microarray technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, from stainless-steel environmental sample swabs. Objective: To validate the PathogenDx EnviroX-Rv assay as part of the Emergency Response Validation (ERV) Performance Tested Method(s)SM (PTM) program. Method: The PathogenDx EnviroX-Rv assay was evaluated for specificity using in silico analysis of ≥41 000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and over 50 exclusivity organisms (both near neighbors and background organisms). The candidate method was evaluated in an unpaired study design for one environmental surface (stainless steel) and compared to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Diagnostic Panel, Instructions for Use (Revision 4, Effective 6/12/2020). Results: Results of the in silico analysis demonstrated the high specificity of the method in being able to detect target SARS-CoV-2 sequences and discriminate them from near neighbors and environmental background organisms. In the matrix study, the candidate method demonstrated a statistically significant difference when compared to the results of the CDC method utilized in this study, with the candidate method resulting in more positive replicates as it only requires one target to be present for a positive sample. Conclusions: The EnviroX-Rv assay rapidly and accurately detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA on environmental swabs from stainless-steel surfaces at a concentration of 2000 genomic copies per 2 × 2"" test area. Highlights: The EnviroX-Rv assay employs dual PCR and hybridization techniques to provide highly accurate results when detecting SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces."
8996,An automated approach to determine antibody endpoint titers for COVID-19 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"While a variety of therapeutic options continue to emerge for COVID-19 treatment, convalescent plasma (CP) has been used as a possible treatment option early in the pandemic. One of the most significant challenges with CP therapy, however, both when defining its efficacy and implementing its approach clinically, is accurately and efficiently characterizing an otherwise heterogenous therapeutic treatment. Given current limitations, our goal is to leverage a SARS antibody testing platform with a newly developed automated endpoint titer analysis program to rapidly define SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in CP donors and hospitalized patients. A newly developed antibody detection platform was used to perform a serial dilution enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Data were then analyzed using commercially available software, GraphPad Prism, or a newly developed program developed in Python called TiterScape, to analyze endpoint titers. Endpoint titer calculations and analysis times were then compared between the two analysis approaches. Serial dilution analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels revealed a high level of heterogeneity between individuals. Commercial platform analysis required significant time for manual data input and extrapolated endpoint titer values when the last serial dilution was above the endpoint cutoff, occasionally producing erroneously high results. By contrast, TiterScape processed 1008 samples for endpoint titer results in roughly 14 minutes compared with the 8 hours required for the commercial software program analysis. Equally important, results generated by TiterScape and Prism were highly similar, with differences averaging 1.26 ± 0.2 percent (mean ± SD). The pandemic has created unprecedented challenges when seeking to accurately test large numbers of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels with a rapid turnaround time. ELISA platforms capable of serial dilution analysis coupled with a highly flexible software interface may provide a useful tool when seeking to define endpoint titers in a high-throughput manner.

Young aged participants, females, participants with history of COVID19 infection, those with comorbid diseases and AstraZeneca vaccine receivers were statistically significant risk factors for having adverse reactions post vaccination, P value (0.03, 0.028, 0.007, 0.019 and 0.0001) respectively. Regarding severity of symptoms, most symptoms were mild and moderate. Residency in Kurdistan Region of Iraq and AstraZeneca vaccine were the statistically significant risk factors for getting severe symptoms P value < 0.0001 of both. Females were an associated risk factor for D-dimer elevation P value = 0.05. Conclusion: fatigue, injection site reactions, fever, myalgia, headache and chills were the most reported side effects. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in term of severity."
8998,Anesthesia Considerations and Infection Precautions for Trauma and Acute Care Cases During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Recommendations From a Task Force of the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread worldwide. During the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, most hospitals have postponed elective surgeries. However, some emergency surgeries, especially for trauma patients, are inevitable. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, a standard protocol addressing preoperative preparation, intraoperative management, and postoperative surveillance should be implemented to avoid nosocomial infection and ensure the safety of patients and the health care workforce. With reference to the guidelines and recommendations issued by the National Health Commission and Chinese Society of Anesthesiology, this article provides recommendations for anesthesia management of trauma and emergency surgery cases during the COVID-19 pandemic."
