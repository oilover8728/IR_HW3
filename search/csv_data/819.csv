8180,Asymptomatic Transmission During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic and Implications for Public Health Strategies.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread rapidly in a few months despite global public health strategies to curb transmission by testing symptomatic patients and social distancing. This review summarizes evidence that highlights transmission by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. Viral load of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases is comparable. Viral shedding is highest before symptom onset, suggesting high transmissibility before symptoms. Within universally tested subgroups, high percentages of SARS-CoV-2 infected asymptomatic individuals were found. Asymptomatic transmission was reported in several clusters, including a Wuhan study showing an alarming rate of intrahospital transmission. Several countries reported higher prevalence among healthcare workers than general population raising concern that healthcare workers could act as silent vectors. Therefore, current strategies that rely solely on ""symptom onset"" for infection identification need urgent reassessment. Extensive universal testing irrespective of symptoms may be considered, with priority placed on groups with high frequency exposure to positive patients."
8181,Direct derivation of human alveolospheres for SARS-CoV-2 infection modeling and drug screening.,"Although the main cellular target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is thought to be alveolar cells, the absence of their tractable culture system precludes the development of a clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 infection model. Here, we establish an efficient human alveolosphere culture method and sphere-based drug testing platform for SARS-CoV-2. Alveolospheres exhibit indolent growth in a Wnt- and R-spondin-dependent manner. Gene expression, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy analyses reveal the presence of alveolar cells in alveolospheres. Alveolospheres express ACE2 and allow SARS-CoV-2 to propagate nearly 100,000-fold in 3 days of infection. Whereas lopinavir and nelfinavir, protease inhibitors used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, have a modest anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2, remdesivir, a nucleotide prodrug, shows an anti-viral effect at the concentration comparable with the circulating drug level. These results demonstrate the validity of the alveolosphere culture system for the development of therapeutic agents to combat SARS-CoV-2."
8182,COVID-19-associated diarrhea.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged as a highly virulent respiratory pathogen that is known as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Diarrhea is a common early symptom in a significant proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in esophageal cells and enterocytes, leading to direct damage to the intestinal epithelium. The infection decreases the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, thereby altering the composition of the gut microbiota. SARS-CoV-2 elicits a cytokine storm, which contributes to gastrointestinal inflammation. The direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2, gut dysbiosis, and aberrant immune response result in increased intestinal permeability, which may exacerbate existing symptoms and worsen the prognosis. By exploring the elements of pathogenesis, several therapeutic options have emerged for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, such as biologics and biotherapeutic agents. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the feces may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 through fecal-oral transmission and contaminate the environment. Thus gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection has important epidemiological significance. The development of new therapeutic and preventive options is necessary to treat and restrict the spread of this severe and widespread infection more effectively. Therefore, we summarize the key elements involved in the pathogenesis and the epidemiology of COVID-19-associated diarrhea."
8183,"Contamination of inert surfaces by SARS-CoV-2: Persistence, stability and infectivity. A review.","Undoubtedly, there is a tremendous concern regarding the new viral strain ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2"" (SARS-CoV-2) and its related disease known as COVID-19. The World Health Organization has stated that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted from person-to-person close contact, as well as by small aerosol respiratory droplets. Moreover, the results of some recent studies about the role of air pollution on the spread and lethality of the novel coronavirus suggest that air contaminants could be also a transmission pathway of the virus. On the other hand, indirect transmission of the virus cannot be discarded. Among many sources of indirect transmission, there is the contamination of inert/inanimate surfaces. This manuscript was aimed at reviewing the scientific literature currently available in PubMed and Scopus. The results of the reviewed studies point out that SARS-CoV-2 can last on different surfaces from hours to a few days. However, rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation is possible by applying commonly available chemicals and biocides on inanimate surfaces. Consequently, although the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces can represent a potential route of transmission, appropriate disinfection measures should reduce the possibilities of coronavirus transmission, and hence, significantly decrease the risks of COVID-19."
8184,Drug targets for corona virus: A systematic review.,"The 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a major source of disaster in the 21th century. However, the lack of specific drugs to prevent/treat an attack is a major need at this current point of time. In this regard, we conducted a systematic review to identify major druggable targets in coronavirus (CoV). We searched PubMed and RCSB database with keywords HCoV, NCoV, corona virus, SERS-CoV, MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV, crystal structure, X-ray crystallography structure, NMR structure, target, and drug target till Feb 3, 2020. The search identified seven major targets (spike protein, envelop protein, membrane protein, protease, nucleocapsid protein, hemagglutinin esterase, and helicase) for which drug design can be considered. There are other 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which can also be considered from the drug design perspective. The major structural proteins and NSPs may serve an important role from drug design perspectives. However, the occurrence of frequent recombination events is a major deterrent factor toward the development of CoV-specific vaccines/drugs."
8185,Group Testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus 2 to Enable Rapid Scale-up of Testing and Real-Time Surveillance of Incidence.,"High-throughput molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be enabled by group testing in which pools of specimens are screened, and individual specimens tested only after a pool tests positive. Several laboratories have recently published examples of pooling strategies applied to SARS-CoV-2 specimens, but overall guidance on efficient pooling strategies is lacking. Therefore we developed a model of the efficiency and accuracy of specimen pooling algorithms based on available data on SAR-CoV-2 viral dynamics. For a fixed number of tests, we estimate that programs using group testing could screen 2-20 times as many specimens compared with individual testing, increase the total number of true positive infections identified, and improve the positive predictive value of results. We compare outcomes that may be expected in different testing situations and provide general recommendations for group testing implementation. A free, publicly-available Web calculator is provided to help inform laboratory decisions on SARS-CoV-2 pooling algorithms."
8186,Suboptimal Biological Sampling as a Probable Cause of False-Negative COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Results.,"False-negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test results can negatively impact the clinical and public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We used droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to demonstrate that human DNA levels, a stable molecular marker of sampling quality, were significantly lower in samples from 40 confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases that yielded negative diagnostic test results (ie, suspected false-negative test results) compared with a representative pool of 87 specimens submitted for COVID-19 testing. Our results support suboptimal biological sampling as a contributor to false-negative COVID-19 test results and underscore the importance of proper training and technique in the collection of nasopharyngeal specimens."
8187,The different clinical characteristics of corona virus disease cases between children and their families in China - the character of children with COVID-19.,"This study aims to analyze the different clinical characteristics between children and their families infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Clinical data from nine children and their 14 families were collected, including general status, clinical, laboratory test, and imaging characteristics. All the children were detected positive result after their families onset. Three children had fever (22.2%) or cough (11.2%) symptoms and six (66.7%) children had no symptom. Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough (35.7%), chest tightness/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%). Nearly 70% of the patients had normal (71.4%) or decreased (28.6%) white blood cell counts, and 50% (7/14) had lymphocytopenia. There were 10 adults (71.4%) showed abnormal imaging. The main manifestations were pulmonary consolidation (70%), nodular shadow (50%), and ground glass opacity (50%). Five discharged children were admitted again because their stool showed positive result in SARS-CoV-2 PCR. COVID-19 in children is mainly caused by family transmission, and their symptoms are mild and prognosis is better than adult. However, their PCR result in stool showed longer time than their families. Because of the mild or asymptomatic clinical process, it is difficult to recognize early for pediatrician and public health staff."
