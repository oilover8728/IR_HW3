7010,An overview of the effect of bioaerosol size in coronavirus disease 2019 transmission.,"The fast spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) constitutes a worldwide challenge to the public health, educational and trade systems, affecting the overall well-being of human societies. The high transmission and mortality rates of this virus, and the unavailability of a vaccine or treatment, resulted in the decision of multiple governments to enact measures of social distancing. Such measures can reduce the exposure to bioaerosols, which can result in pathogen deposition in the respiratory tract of the host causing disease and an immunological response. Thus, it is important to consider the validity of the proposal for keeping a distance of at least 2 m from other persons to avoid the spread of COVID-19. This work reviews the effect of aerodynamic diameter (size) of particles carrying RNA copies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A SARS-CoV-2 carrier person talking, sneezing or coughing at distance of 2 m can still provide a pathogenic bioaerosol load with submicron particles that remain viable in air for up to 3 h for exposure of healthy persons near and far from the source in a stagnant environment. The deposited bioaerosol creates contaminated surfaces, which if touched can act as a path to introduce the pathogen by mouth, nose or eyes and cause disease."
7011,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 and Enteroviruses in Sewage Water-A Pilot Study.,"Due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), combined with the risk of polio importation from Ukraine, we evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and enteroviruses in 25 sewage water samples from Romania, concentrated using the WHO method between January 2020 and January 2021. Surveillance for enteroviruses and SARS-CoV-2 are relevant in the calculation of prevalence estimates as well as early detection of the introduction or disappearance of these viruses. For SARS-CoV-2 detection, we used two immunochromatographic nucleocapsid antigenic tests as well as real-time PCR assays, produced for respiratory samples. The isolation of cell culture lines, in accordance with the WHO recommendations, was carried out for enterovirus detection. Twenty-three of the samples investigated were positive in rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2, while the RNA of SARS-CoV-2, detected with Respiratory 2.1 plus a panel Biofire Film array, was present in eight samples. The Allplex 2019-nCoV assay was used for the validation of the tests. There were three genes detected in one sample, E, RdPR, and N, two genes, E and RdPR, in one sample, two genes, RdPR and N, in four samples, one gene, RdPR, in five samples and one gene, N, in one sample. Eight samples were positive for non-polio enteroviruses, and no poliovirus strains were isolated. This study suggests the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and enteroviruses in Romanian sewage water in 2020. As such, our results indicate that a rapid, more specific test should be developed especially for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage water."
7012,"COVID-19 pandemic effect on early pregnancy: are miscarriage rates altered, in asymptomatic women?","Purpose: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic state on early, first-trimester pregnancies. Methods: A retrospective cohort study conducted at a university-affiliated fertility center in Montreal, Quebec, since the COVID-19 shut down, March 13 until May 6, 2020. Included: all women who came for a first-trimester viability scan during the study period (Study group) and between March 1, 2019 and May 17, 2019, approximately one year prior (Control). The study population denied symptoms of COVID-19. We reviewed all first trimester scans. Early first-trimester pregnancy outcomes (Viable pregnancy, arrested pregnancy including biochemical pregnancy loss and miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy) were measured as total number and percentage. A multivariate analysis was performed to control for other potentially significant variables, as was a power analysis supporting sample size. Results: 113 women came for a first-trimester viability scan in the study period, and 172 in the control period (5-11 weeks gestational age), mean maternal age 36.5 ± 4.5 and 37.2 ± 5.4 years (p = 0.28). Viable clinical pregnancy rate was not different between the two groups (76.1 vs. 80.2% in the pandemic and pre-pandemic groups p = 0.41). No significant difference was seen in the total number of arrested pregnancies (defined as the sum of biochemical, 1st trimester miscarriages, and blighted ova) (22.1 vs. 16.9% p = 0.32), or in each type of miscarriage. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic environment does not seem to affect early first-trimester miscarriage rates in asymptomatic patients."

7014,Whom Should We Test for COVID-19? Performance of a Symptom and Risk Factor Questionnaire on COVID-19 Test Results and Patient Outcomes in an Immediate Care Setting.,"Introduction: The CDC and Illinois Department of Public Health disseminated risk factor criteria for COVID-19 testing early in the pandemic. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of risk stratifying patients for COVID-19 testing and to identify which risk factors and which other clinical variables were associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR test positivity. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study on a sample of symptomatic patients evaluated at an immediate care setting. A risk assessment questionnaire was administered to every patient before clinician evaluation. High-risk patients received SARS-CoV-2 test and low-risk patients were evaluated by a clinician and selectively tested based on clinician judgment. Multivariate analyses tested whether risk factors and additional variables were associated with test positivity. Results: The adjusted odds ratio of testing positive was associated with COVID-19-positive or suspect close contact (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.10), large gathering attendance with a COVID-19-positive individual (aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.10-3.34), and, with the largest effect size, decreased taste/smell (aOR 2.83, 95% CI 2.01-3.99). Testing positive was associated with ages 45-64 and ≥65 (aOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25-2.44, and aOR 2.78, 95% CI 1.49-5.16), systolic blood pressures ≤120 (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.20-2.24), and, with the largest effect size, temperatures ≥99.0°F (aOR 3.06, 95% CI 2.23-4.20). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 test was similar between high-risk and low risk patients (225 [22.2%] vs 50 [19.8%]; P = .41). Discussion: The risk assessment questionnaire was not effective at stratifying patients for testing. Although individual risk factors were associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, the low-risk group had similar positivity rates to the high-risk group. Our observations underscore the need for clinicians to develop clinical experience and share best practices and for systems and payors to support policies, funding, and resources to test all symptomatic patients."
7015,Association Between COVID-19 Exposure and Self-reported Compliance With Public Health Guidelines Among Essential Employees at an Institution of Higher Education in the US.,"Importance: Detailed analysis of infection rates paired with behavioral and employee-reported risk factors is vital to understanding how transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be exacerbated or mitigated in the workplace. Institutions of higher education are heterogeneous work units that supported continued in-person employment during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a test site for occupational health evaluation. Objective: To evaluate the association between self-reported protective behaviors and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among essential in-person employees during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Design, setting, and participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 13 to September 2, 2020, at an institution of higher education in Fort Collins, Colorado. Employees 18 years or older without symptoms of COVID-19 who identified as essential in-person workers during the first 6 months of the pandemic were included. Participants completed a survey, and blood and nasal swab samples were collected to assess active SARS-CoV-2 infection via quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and past infection by serologic testing. Exposure: Self-reported practice of protective behaviors against COVID-19 according to public health guidelines provided to employees. Main outcomes and measures: Prevalence of current SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by qRT-PCR or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by an IgG SARS-CoV-2 testing platform. The frequency of protective behavior practices and essential workers' concerns regarding contracting COVID-19 and exposing others were measured based on survey responses. Results: Among 508 participants (305 [60.0%] women, 451 [88.8%] non-Hispanic White individuals; mean [SD] age, 41.1 [12.5] years), there were no qRT-PCR positive test results, and only 2 participants (0.4%) had seroreactive IgG antibodies. Handwashing and mask wearing were reported frequently both at work (480 [94.7%] and 496 [97.8%] participants, respectively) and outside work (465 [91.5%] and 481 [94.7%] participants, respectively). Social distancing was reported less frequently at work (403 [79.5%]) than outside work (465 [91.5%]) (P < .001). Participants were more highly motivated to avoid exposures because of concern about spreading the infection to others (419 [83.0%]) than for personal protection (319 [63.2%]) (P < .001). Conclusions and relevance: In this cross-sectional study of essential workers at an institution of higher education, when employees reported compliance with public health practices both at and outside work, they were able to operate safely in their work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic."
7016,"Practical Guidelines for Collection, Manipulation and Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Clinical Specimens.","SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that causes the acute respiratory disease-Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-which has led to a global health crisis. Currently, no prophylactics or therapies exist to control virus spread or mitigate the disease. Thus, the risk of infection for physicians and scientists is high, requiring work to be conducted in Biosafety Level-3 (BSL-3) facilities if virus will be isolated or propagated. However, inactivation of the virus can enable safe handling at a reduced biosafety level, making samples accessible to a diverse array of institutions and investigators. Institutions of all types have an immediate need for guidelines that outline safe collection, handling, and inactivation of samples suspected to contain active virus. Here we provide a practical guide for physicians and researchers wishing to work with materials from patients who are COVID-19 positive or suspected positive. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

7017,"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome of Children: Subphenotypes, Risk Factors, Biomarkers, Cytokine Profiles, and Viral Sequencing.","Objective: To assess demographic, clinical, and biomarker features distinguishing patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); compare MIS-C sub-phenotypes; identify cytokine biosignatures; and characterize viral genome sequences. Study design: We performed a prospective observational cohort study of 124 children hospitalized and treated under the institutional MIS-C Task Force protocol from March to September 2020 at Children's National, a quaternary freestanding children's hospital in Washington, DC. Of this cohort, 63 of the patients had the diagnosis of MIS-C (39 confirmed, 24 probable) and 61 were from the same cohort of admitted patients who subsequently had an alternative diagnosis (controls). Results: Median age and sex were similar between MIS-C and controls. Black (46%) and Latino (35%) children were over-represented in the MIS-C cohort, with Black children at greatest risk (OR 4.62, 95% CI 1.151-14.10; P = .007). Cardiac complications were more frequent in critically ill patients with MIS-C (55% vs 28%; P = .04) including systolic myocardial dysfunction (39% vs 3%; P = .001) and valvular regurgitation (33% vs 7%; P = .01). Median cycle threshold was 31.8 (27.95-35.1 IQR) in MIS-C cases, significantly greater (indicating lower viral load) than in primary severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Cytokines soluble interleukin 2 receptor, interleukin [IL]-10, and IL-6 were greater in patients with MIS-C compared with controls. Cytokine analysis revealed subphenotype differences between critically ill vs noncritically ill (IL-2, soluble interleukin 2 receptor, IL-10, IL-6); polymerase chain reaction positive vs negative (tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-10, IL-6); and presence vs absence of cardiac abnormalities (IL-17). Phylogenetic analysis of viral genome sequences revealed predominance of GH clade originating in Europe, with no differences comparing patients with MIS-C with patients with primary coronavirus disease 19. Treatment was well tolerated, and no children died. Conclusions: This study establishes a well-characterized large cohort of MIS-C evaluated and treated following a standardized protocol and identifies key clinical, biomarker, cytokine, viral load, and sequencing features. Long-term follow-up will provide opportunity for future insights into MIS-C and its sequelae."
7018,"Investigation and Serologic Follow-Up of Contacts of an Early Confirmed Case-Patient with COVID-19, Washington, USA.","We describe the contact investigation for an early confirmed case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in the United States. Contacts of the case-patient were identified, actively monitored for symptoms, interviewed for a detailed exposure history, and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) and ELISA. Fifty contacts were identified and 38 (76%) were interviewed, of whom 11 (29%) reported unprotected face-to-face interaction with the case-patient. Thirty-seven (74%) had respiratory specimens tested by rRT-PCR, and all tested negative. Twenty-three (46%) had ELISA performed on serum samples collected ≈6 weeks after exposure, and none had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Among contacts who were tested, no secondary transmission was identified in this investigation, despite unprotected close interactions with the infectious case-patient."
