4340,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among persons living in homeless shelters in France.,"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is frequent and can constitute a barrier to the dissemination of vaccines once they are available. Unequal access to vaccines may also contribute to socioeconomic inequalities with regard to COVID-19. We studied vaccine hesitancy among persons living in homeless shelters in France between May and June 2020 (n = 235). Overall, 40.9% of study participants reported vaccine hesitancy, which is comparable to general population trends in France. In multivariate regression models, factors associated with vaccine hesitancy are: being a woman (OR = 2.55; 95% CI 1.40-4.74), living with a partner (OR = 2.48, 95% CI 1.17-5.41), no legal residence in France (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.92), and health literacy (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.21, 0.68). Our results suggest that trends in vaccine hesitancy and associated factors are similar among homeless persons as in the general population. Dissemination of information on vaccine risks and benefits needs to be adapted to persons who experience severe disadvantage."
4341,An overview of molecular biology and nanotechnology based analytical methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: promising biotools for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19.,"Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is drastically affecting 214 countries, causing severe pneumonia in patients, which has resulted in lockdown being implemented in several countries to stop its local transmission. Considering this, the rapid screening and accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCoV) play an essential role in the diagnosis of COVID-19, which can minimize local transmission and prevent an epidemic. Due to this public health emergency, the development of ultra-fast reliable diagnostic kits is essential for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Recently, molecular biology and nanotechnology based analytical methods have proven to be promising diagnostic tools for the rapid screening of 2019-nCoV with high accuracy and precision. The main aim of this review is to provide a retrospective overview on the molecular biology tools (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)) and nanotechnology based analytical tools (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RT-PCR, and lateral flow assay) for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. This review also presents recent reports on other analytical techniques including paper spray mass spectrometry for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in clinical samples. Finally, we provide a quick reference on molecular biology and nanotechnology based analytical tools for COVID-19 diagnosis in clinical samples."
4342,The Performance of the Iranian Red Crescent by Launching Testing Centers for the Coronavirus Disease.,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) screening project has been conducted by the Red Crescent Society for 17 days with the aim of identifying and treating people with COVID-19, reducing road trips, and sensitizing people to the problem. Due to the shortage of testing devices, passengers were screened by measuring skin temperature. In 851 screening posts, 95 371 volunteers of Red Crescent monitored 21 640 866 people.Besides screening people, the stations have had other functions, including urging people to stay at home, restricting road trips, especially during the Iranian New Year holidays, reassuring the people that all relevant organizations are doing their best to respond to COVID-19, and the like. However, future research is still needed to analyze the cost-benefit of this plan and other possible options."
4343,Dynamic profile for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using four immunochromatographic assays.,"In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection, there is a growing need and demand for diagnostic tools that are complementary and different from the RT-PCR currently in use. Multiple serological tests are or will be very soon available but need to be evaluated and validated. We have thus tested 4 immunochromatographic tests for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we assessed the kinetics of antibody appearance using these assays in 22 patients after they were tested positive by RT-PCR. We observed great heterogeneity in antibody detection post-symptom onset. The median antibody detection time was between 8 and 10 days according to the manufacturers. All the tests showed a sensitivity of 60 to 80% on day 10 and 100% on day 15. In addition, a single cross-reaction was observed with other human coronavirus infections. Thus, immunochromatographic tests for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have their place for the diagnostic panel of COVID-19."
4344,Parental Coronavirus Disease 2019 Testing of Hospitalized Children: Rethinking Infection Control in a Pandemic.,"Background: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a challenge to infection control within hospital systems. Asymptomatic children and their caretakers carry the risk of silently spreading infection in pediatric emergency departments and hospital units. Our current knowledge is evolving, and infection control measures are frequently changing depending on new emerging data. Methods: We conducted a point-prevalence study to assess SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR) results of hospitalized children, their asymptomatic caretakers, and caretaker-child test concordance at a major community hospital in New York City. We screened Children and caretakers with temperature measurements and the presence of COVID-19 symptoms before pediatric emergency department evaluation. Children requiring hospitalization and their caretakers had nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The paired results are used to identify the infection control level at the appropriate pediatric unit. Results: Forty consecutive asymptomatic caretaker-child pairs had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between May 28th to June 22nd, 2020. The rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 was 2.5% in hospitalized children and 7.5% in caretakers. The caretaker-child SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test concordance was evident in 95% of the cohort. Conclusion: This cohort had a low asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive rate in children and their caretakers with a high concordance rate of paired test results. It suggests that children's SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result will likely correspond to their accompanying caretaker at healthcare facilities where admission screening is performed."
4345,How to spot COVID-19 patients: Speech & sound audio analysis for preliminary diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 corona patients.,"Background: The global cases of COVID-19 increasing day by day. On 25 November 2020, a total of 59 850 910 cases reported globally with a 1 411 216 global death. In India, total cases in the country now stand at 91 77 841 including 86 04 955 recoveries and 4 38 667 active cases as on 24 November 2020, as per the data issued by ICMR. A new generation of voice/audio analysis application can tell whether the person is suffering from COVID-19 or not. Aims: To describe how to established a new generation of voice/audio analysis application to identify the suspected COVID-19 hidden cases in hotspot areas with the help of an audio sample of the general public. Materials & methods: The different patents and data available as literature on the internet are evaluated to make a new generation of voice/audio analysis application with the help of an audio sample of the general public. Results: The collection of the audio sample will be done from the already suffered COVID-19 patients in (.Wave files) personally or through phone calls. The audio samples such as the sound of the cough, the pattern of breathing, respiration rate and way of speech will be recorded. The parameters will be evaluated for loudness, articulation, tempo, rhythm, melody and timbre. The analysis and interpretation of the parameters can be made through machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect corona cases with an audio sample. Discussion: The voice/audio application current project can be merged with a mobile App called 'AarogyaSetu' by the Government of India. The project can be implemented in the high-risk area of COVID-19 in the country. Conclusion: This new method of detecting cases will decrease the workload in the COVID-19 laboratory."
4346,Factors associated with negative conversion of viral RNA in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.,"Factors associated with negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospitalized patients have not yet been systematically determined. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, China. Both univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify independent factors for time to viral RNA negative conversion. Data on patients with re-detectable viral RNA after showing negative on RT-PCR test (intermittent negative status) were also analyzed. A total of 59 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were included in this study, with a median duration of 1 (interquartile range, IQR: 0-2) day from symptom onset to hospital admission. Median communicable period (from first day of positive nucleic acid test to first day of consecutive negative results) was 14 (IQR: 10-18) days, and 7 (IQR: 6-10) days for 10 patients with intermittent negative results. Age older than 45 years (hazard ratio, HR: 0.378; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.205-0.698) and chest tightness (HR: 0.290; 95%CI: 0.091-0.919) were factors independently affecting negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Headache (odds ratio: 7.553; 95%CI: 1.011-28.253) was significantly associated with intermittent negative status, with a predicted probability of 60%. Older age and chest tightness were independently associated with delayed clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospitalized patients. These predictors would provide a new perspective on early identification of patients with prolonged viral shedding and facilitate optimal isolation protocols and treatment strategies."
