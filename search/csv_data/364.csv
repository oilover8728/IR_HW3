3630,Comparing COVID-19 vaccine allocation strategies in India: A mathematical modelling study.,"Background: The development and widespread use of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could prevent substantial morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 and mitigate the secondary effects associated with non-pharmaceutical interventions. Methods: We used an age-structured, expanded SEIR model with social contact matrices to assess age-specific vaccine allocation strategies in India. We used state-specific age structures and disease transmission coefficients estimated from confirmed incident cases of COVID-19 between 1 July and 31 August 2020. Simulations were used to investigate the relative reduction in mortality and morbidity of vaccine allocation strategies based on prioritizing different age groups, and the interactions of these strategies with concurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions. Given the uncertainty associated with COVID-19 vaccine development, we varied vaccine characteristics in the modelling simulations. Results: Prioritizing COVID-19 vaccine allocation for older populations (i.e., >60 years) led to the greatest relative reduction in deaths, regardless of vaccine efficacy, control measures, rollout speed, or immunity dynamics. Preferential vaccination of this group often produced relatively higher total symptomatic infections and more pronounced estimates of peak incidence than other assessed strategies. Vaccine efficacy, immunity type, target coverage, and rollout speed significantly influenced overall strategy effectiveness, with the time taken to reach target coverage significantly affecting the relative mortality benefit comparative to no vaccination. Conclusions: Our findings support global recommendations to prioritize COVID-19 vaccine allocation for older age groups. Relative differences between allocation strategies were reduced as the speed of vaccine rollout was increased. Optimal vaccine allocation strategies will depend on vaccine characteristics, strength of concurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions, and region-specific goals."
3631,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies formed in response to the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1237 mRNA vaccine by commercial antibody tests.,"Background: With rapid approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the ability of clinical laboratories to detect vaccine-induced antibodies with available high-throughput commercial assays is unknown. We aimed to determine if commercial serology assays can detect vaccine-induced antibodies (VIAs) and understand the vaccination response. Methods: This cohort study recruited healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities (receiving the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 products, respectively) who underwent serum collection pre-vaccination (BNT162b2 group), 2-weeks post vaccination (both groups), and pre-2nd dose (both groups). Sera were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using four commercial assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, DiaSorin Trimeric S IgG, and GenScript cPASS) to detect VIAs. Secondary outcomes included description of post-vaccination antibody response and correlation with neutralizing titers. Results: 225 participants (177 receiving BNT162b2 and 48 receiving mRNA-1273) were included (median age 41 years; 66-78% female). Nucleocapsid IgG was found in 4.1% and 21.9% of the BNT162b2 (baseline) and mRNA-1273 (2-weeks post first dose). All anti-spike assays detected antibodies post-vaccination, with an average increase of 87.2% (range 73.8-94.3%; BNT162b2), and 25.2% (range 23.8-26.7%; mRNA-1273) between the first and last sampling time points (all p < 0.05). Neutralizing antibodies were detected at all post-vaccine timepoints for both vaccine arms, with increasing titers over time (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Anti-spike vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 IgG are detectable by commercially available high-throughput assays and increases over time. Prior to second dose of vaccination, neutralizing antibodies are detectable in 73-89% of individuals, suggesting most individuals would have some degree of protection from subsequent infection."

3633,Facial and Oral Manifestations Following COVID-19 Vaccination: A Survey-Based Study and a First Perspective.,"(1) Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The development of effective and safe vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has been extremely fast. The list of orofacial adverse effects of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines based on the clinical trials are reported to be rare. The aim of this study was to investigate the facial and oral manifestations of COVID-19 vaccination using a survey-based study. (2) Methods: The questionnaire was developed using Google Forms and sent anonymously to a total of 700 subjects (medical personnel) in Poland, Italy, and other EU countries. (3) Results: 223 people answered the questionnaire, mainly vaccinated with BNT162b2. Only 3.1% and 5.4% experienced oral and facial symptoms, respectively. General diseases presence and age have significant influence on the probability of oral symptoms occurrence after the second dose. Facial symptoms are correlated with general disease; autoimmune pathologies and age, at first and second dose, respectively. Gender, smoking and regular medication intake have significant influence on the probability of taking an absence day. Gender, age, and smoking have a significant influence on the duration of symptoms after second dose. (4) Conclusions: Based on the results of this preliminary survey, there is no observed significant correlation between vaccine administration for COVID-19 and facial and oral manifestations."

3635,Genetic comparison among various coronavirus strains for the identification of potential vaccine targets of SARS-CoV2.,"On-going pandemic pneumonia outbreak COVID-19 has raised an urgent public health issue worldwide impacting millions of people with a continuous increase in both morbidity and mortality. The causative agent of this disease is identified and named as SARS-CoV2 because of its genetic relatedness to SARS-CoV species that was responsible for the 2003 coronavirus outbreak. The immense spread of the disease in a very small period demands urgent development of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for the treatment of SARS-CoV2 infected patients. A plethora of research is being conducted globally on this novel coronavirus strain to gain knowledge about its origin, evolutionary history, and phylogeny. This review is an effort to compare genetic similarities and diversifications among coronavirus strains, which can hint towards the susceptible antigen targets of SARS-CoV2 to come up with the potential therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for the prevention of this public threat."
3636,"Prevalence, clinical features, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women with or without mild/moderate symptoms: Results from universal screening in a tertiary care center in Mexico City, Mexico.","The perinatal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still largely unknown. This study aimed to describe the features and outcomes of pregnant women with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection after the universal screening was established in a large tertiary care center admitting only obstetric related conditions without severe COVID-19 in Mexico City. This retrospective case-control study integrates data between April 22 and May 25, 2020, during active community transmission in Mexico, with one of the highest COVID-19 test positivity percentages worldwide. Only pregnant women and neonates with a SARS-CoV-2 result by quantitative RT-PCR were included in this study. Among 240 pregnant women, the prevalence of COVID-19 was 29% (95% CI, 24% to 35%); 86% of the patients were asymptomatic (95% CI, 76%-92%), nine women presented mild symptoms, and one patient moderate disease. No pregnancy baseline features or risk factors associated with severity of infection, including maternal age > 35 years, Body Mass Index >30 kg/m2, and pre-existing diseases, differed between positive and negative women. The median gestational age at admission for both groups was 38 weeks. All women were discharged at home without complications, and no maternal death was reported. The proportion of preeclampsia was higher in positive women than negative women (18%, 95% CI, 10%-29% vs. 9%, 95% CI, 5%-14%, P<0.05). No differences were found for other perinatal outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 test result was positive for nine infants of positive mothers detected within 24h of birth. An increased number of infected neonates were admitted to the NICU, compared to negative neonates (44% vs. 22%, P<0.05) and had a longer length of hospitalization (2 [2-18] days vs. 2 [2-3] days, P<0.001); these are potential proxies for illness severity. This report highlights the importance of COVID-19 detection at delivery in pregnant women living in high transmission areas."
3637,Myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination - A case series.,"There have been reports of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination. We surveyed all hospitalized military personnel in the Isareli Defense Forces during the period of the COVID-19 vaccination operation (12/28/2021-3/7/2021) for diagnosed myocarditis. We identified 7 cases of myocarditis with symptoms starting in the first week after the second dose of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. One case of myocarditis diagnosed 10 days after the second dose of the vaccine was not included. These 8 cases comprise of all events of myocarditis diagnosed in military personnel during this time period. All patients were young and generally healthy. All had mild disease with no sequalae. The incidence of myocarditis in the week following a second dose of the vaccine was 5.07/100,000 people vaccinated. Due to the nature of this report no causality could be established. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of myocarditis following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination. True incidence rates should be further investigated."

3639,Hip fracture in elderly and COVID-19 infection. Report of 3 cases.,"Since its first description in china in January 2020, COVID-19 pandemia outbreak has affected health organization and conventional care in all settings as wards, intensive care and surgery. Hip fracture patients usually are older and have a lot of comorbidities. This type of patientes benefit from early surgery. However, surgery in COVID-19 patients with active infection is associate with bad outcomes and mortality. We present three patients with COVID infection undergoing hip fracture surgery. Surgery was performed tree weeks after admission. Despite have risk factor (old age, arterial hypertension, elevated inflammatory parameters) the outcome was good and were discharged from hospital without events."
