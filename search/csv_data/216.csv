2150,Genetic and Chemical Capsid Modifications of Adenovirus Vectors to Modulate Vector-Host Interactions.,"Adenovirus-based vectors are playing an important role as efficacious genetic vaccines to fight the current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, they have an enormous potential as oncolytic vectors for virotherapy and as vectors for classic gene therapy. However, numerous vector-host interactions on a cellular and noncellular level, including specific components of the immune system, must be modulated in order to generate safe and efficacious vectors for virotherapy or classic gene therapy. Importantly, the current widespread use of Ad vectors as vaccines against COVID-19 will induce antivector immunity in many humans. This requires the development of strategies and techniques to enable Ad-based vectors to evade pre-existing immunity. In this review article, we discuss the current status of genetic and chemical capsid modifications as means to modulate the vector-host interactions of Ad-based vectors."

2152,Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunction in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly worldwide. Given scarce resources, nonlaboratory diagnostics are crucial. In this cross-sectional study, two-thirds of European patients with confirmed COVID-19 reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, indicating the significance of these symptoms in early diagnostics."
2153,"COVID-19 Testing and Diagnostics: A Review of Commercialized Technologies for Cost, Convenience and Quality of Tests.","Population-scale and rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2 continues to be a priority for several parts of the world. We revisit the in vitro technology platforms for COVID-19 testing and diagnostics-molecular tests and rapid antigen tests, serology or antibody tests, and tests for the management of COVID-19 patients. Within each category of tests, we review the commercialized testing platforms, their analyzing systems, specimen collection protocols, testing methodologies, supply chain logistics, and related attributes. Our discussion is essentially focused on test products that have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA to detect and diagnose COVID-19 infections. Different strategies for scaled-up and faster screening are covered here, such as pooled testing, screening programs, and surveillance testing. The near-term challenges lie in detecting subtle infectivity profiles, mapping the transmission dynamics of new variants, lowering the cost for testing, training a large healthcare workforce, and providing test kits for the masses. Through this review, we try to understand the feasibility of universal access to COVID-19 testing and diagnostics in the near future while being cognizant of the implicit tradeoffs during the development and distribution cycles of new testing platforms."

2156,Immunology of COVID-19.,The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 reveals a delicate balance between protective effects and harmful pathological reactions and can possibly explain the highly variable disease manifestations in subjects infected with this novel coronavirus. A better understanding of the anti-viral immune response is not only critical for vaccine development but might also provide targets for pharmaceutical and immunological treatment options. Recent research literature on immune aspects of COVID-19 is summarized in this review with an outlook how bats have evolved to live with these viral infections.
2157,HLA-dependent heterogeneity and macrophage immunoproteasome activation during lung COVID-19 disease.,"Background: The worldwide pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by significant and unpredictable heterogeneity in symptoms that remains poorly understood. Methods: Transcriptome and single cell transcriptome of COVID19 lung were integrated with deeplearning analysis of MHC class I immunopeptidome against SARS-COV2 proteome. Results: An analysis of the transcriptomes of lung samples from COVID-19 patients revealed that activation of MHC class I antigen presentation in these tissues was correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA present. Similarly, a positive relationship was detected in these samples between the level of SARS-CoV-2 and the expression of a genomic cluster located in the 6p21.32 region (40 kb long, inside the MHC-II cluster) that encodes constituents of the immunoproteasome. An analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of bronchoalveolar cells highlighted the activation of the immunoproteasome in CD68 + M1 macrophages of COVID-19 patients in addition to a PSMB8-based trajectory in these cells that featured an activation of defense response during mild cases of the disease, and an impairment of alveolar clearance mechanisms during severe COVID-19. By examining the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 immunopeptidome with the most common HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles worldwide, we found higher numbers of stronger presenters in type A alleles and in Asian populations, which could shed light on why this disease is now less widespread in this part of the world. Conclusions: HLA-dependent heterogeneity in macrophage immunoproteasome activation during lung COVID-19 disease could have implications for efforts to predict the response to HLA-dependent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the global population."
