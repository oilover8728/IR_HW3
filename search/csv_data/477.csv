4761,COVID-19: protocol for observational studies utilizing near real-time electronic Australian general practice data to promote effective care and best-practice policy-a design thinking approach.,"Background: Health systems around the world have been forced to make choices about how to prioritize care, manage infection control and maintain reserve capacity for future disease outbreaks. Primary healthcare has moved into the front line as COVID-19 testing transitions from hospitals to multiple providers, where tracking testing behaviours can be fragmented and delayed. Pooled general practice data are a valuable resource which can be used to inform population and individual care decision-making. This project aims to examine the feasibility of using near real-time electronic general practice data to promote effective care and best-practice policy. Methods: The project will utilize a design thinking approach involving all collaborators (primary health networks [PHNs], general practices, consumer groups, researchers, and digital health developers, pathology professionals) to enhance the development of meaningful and translational project outcomes. The project will be based on a series of observational studies utilizing near real-time electronic general practice data from a secure and comprehensive digital health platform [POpulation Level Analysis and Reporting (POLAR) general practice data warehouse]. The study will be carried out over 1.5 years (July 2020-December 2021) using data from over 450 general practices within three Victorian PHNs and Gippsland PHN, Eastern Melbourne PHN and South Eastern Melbourne PHN, supplemented by data from consenting general practices from two PHNs in New South Wales, Central and Eastern Sydney PHN and South Western Sydney PHN. Discussion: The project will be developed using a design thinking approach, leading to the building of a meaningful near real-time COVID-19 geospatial reporting framework and dashboard for decision-makers at community, state and nationwide levels, to identify and monitor emerging trends and the impact of interventions/policy decisions. This will integrate timely evidence about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic related to its diagnosis and treatment, and its impact across clinical, population and general practice levels."
4762,Advances in research on ACE2 as a receptor for 2019-nCoV.,"Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also called 2019-nCoV) has triggered pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute infectious respiratory disease that first became epidemic in Wuhan (China) and is now spreading worldwide. Although 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are very similar viruses genomically and structurally, the huge number of severe cases and deaths now being caused by 2019-nCoV infections has understandably prompted intense research on the receptor used by it to enter human cells. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, now appears likely to mediate 2019-nCoV entry into human cells. In this review, we describe the roles performed by ACE2 as an enzymatic catalyst and as a receptor for this novel coronavirus. We also summarize the latest research pertaining to the changes noted in ACE2 expression after viral binding, and the relationships relating to virus transmission and population susceptibility to it. Lastly, we speculate on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and provide a useful reference for drug development against this aggressive virus."
4763,Increasing SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing capacity by sample pooling.,"Objectives: Limited testing capacity has characterized the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Spain, hampering timely control of outbreaks and opportunities to reduce the escalation of community transmission. This study investigated the potential to use sample pooling, followed by one-step retrotranscription and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to increase testing capacity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: Various pool sizes (five, 10 and 15 samples) were evaluated prior to RNA extraction followed by standard RT-qPCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The pool size achieving reproducible results with individual sample testing was subsequently used to assess nasopharyngeal samples in a tertiary hospital in August 2020. Results: A pool size of five samples had higher sensitivity compared with pool sizes of 10 and 15 samples, showing a mean cycle threshold (Ct) shift of 3.5 [standard deviation (SD) 2.2] between the pooled test and positive samples in the pool. Next, a pool size of five was used to test a total of 895 pools (4475 prospective samples) using two different RT-qPCR kits. The Real Accurate Quadruplex corona-plus PCR Kit (PathoFinder) reported the lowest mean Ct shift [2.2 (SD 2.4)] between the pool and individual samples. This strategy enables detection of individual positive samples in positive pools with Ct of 16.7-39.4. Conclusions: Grouping samples into pools of five for RT-qPCR resulted in an increase in SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity with minimal loss of sensitivity compared with testing each sample individually."
4764,"Large-Scale, In-House Production of Viral Transport Media To Support SARS-CoV-2 PCR Testing in a Multihospital Health Care Network during the COVID-19 Pandemic.","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted worldwide supplies of viral transport media (VTM) due to widespread demand for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) testing. In response to this ongoing shortage, we began production of VTM in-house in support of diagnostic testing in our hospital network. As our diagnostic laboratory was not equipped for reagent production, we took advantage of space and personnel that became available due to closure of the research division of our medical center. We utilized a formulation of VTM described by the CDC that was simple to produce, did not require filtration for sterilization, and used reagents that were available from commercial suppliers. Performance of VTM was evaluated by several quality assurance measures. Based on cycle threshold (CT ) values of spiking experiments, we found that our VTM supported highly consistent amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target (coefficient of variation = 2.95%) using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) assay on the Abbott m2000 platform. VTM was also found to be compatible with multiple swab types and, based on accelerated stability studies, able to maintain functionality for at least 4 months at room temperature. We further discuss how we met logistical challenges associated with large-scale VTM production in a crisis setting, including use of a staged assembly line for VTM transport tube production."
4765,EBCOG position statement on COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant and breastfeeding women.,Covid 19 pandemic has led to significant mortality and long term morbidity globally. Pregnant women are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID 19 infection. There is an urgent need for all health authorities and Governments to offer vaccination to all pregnant women especially those with high risk pregnancy.

4767,Measuring immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection: comparing assays and animal models.,"The rapid scale-up of research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spawned a large number of potential vaccines and immunotherapies, accompanied by a commensurately large number of in vitro assays and in vivo models to measure their effectiveness. These assays broadly have the same end-goal - to predict the clinical efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in humans. However, the apparent potency of different interventions can vary considerably between assays and animal models, leading to very different predictions of clinical efficacy. Complete harmonization of experimental methods may be intractable at the current pace of research. However, here we analyse a selection of existing assays for measuring antibody-mediated virus neutralization and animal models of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and provide a framework for comparing results between studies and reconciling observed differences in the effects of interventions. Finally, we propose how we might optimize these assays for better comparison of results from in vitro and animal studies to accelerate progress."

From pathogenesis to disease modeling, pharmaceuticals to vaccines, immunologists play a crucial role in translating basic science into effective response strategies. This article describes our view on how lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can be developed into an immunologists' guide for preparedness for future pandemics."
