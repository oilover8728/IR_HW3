140,Evaluation of serum IgM and IgG antibodies in COVID-19 patients by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sweeping the world since the end of 2019. The titer change of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further clarified, the clinical and preventive value of antibodies still needs to be further investigated. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established by coating with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein and used to detect serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus disease 2019 patients to evaluate the pattern of changes of antibodies. The specificity of the ELISA for detection SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 96% (144/150) and 100% (150/150), respectively. The sensitivity of ELISA was 100% (150/150) for IgM, and 99.3% (149/150) for IgG. SARS-CoV-2-SP-IgM and SP-IgG antibodies could be detected on Day 1 of hospitalization in 12.5% patients, and SP-IgM began to decrease after reaching its peak at around 22-28 days, and become negative at Month 3 in 30% patients and negative at Month 7 in 79% of these patients after onset; IgG reached its peak around Day 22-28 and kept at a high level within the longest observation period for 4 months, it dropped very sharply at 7 months. The positive rates of SP-IgM and SP-IgG were higher than those of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on Day 7 and 4. The established indirect ELISA has good specificity and sensitivity. IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 appeared almost simultaneously in the early stage, and the level of IgG antibodies could not maintain a high plateau in the observation period of 7 months. Our data will help develop the diagnosis and vaccine of SARS-CoV-2."
141,SARS-CoV-2 testing disparities across geographical regions from a large metropolitan area in Brazil: Results from a web-based survey among individuals interested in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines.,"After more than a year since the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 or COVID-19 has reached the status of a global pandemic, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Brazil. As no effective treatment been approved yet, only mass vaccination can stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and end the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates are under development and some are currently in use. This study aims to describe the characteristics of individuals who have registered in an online platform to participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, participants' characteristics according to age and presence of comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and differences of SARS-CoV-2 testing across different geographical areas/neighborhoods are provided. This was a cross-sectional web-based study conducted between September and December/2020, aiming to reach individuals aged ≥18 years who live in Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, Brazil. Among 21,210 individuals who completed the survey, 20,587 (97.1%) were willing to participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines. Among those willing to participate, 57.8% individuals were aged 18-59 years and had no comorbidity, 33.7% were aged 18-59 years and had at least one comorbidity, and 8.6% were aged ≥ 60 years regardless the presence of any comorbidity. Almost half (42.6%) reported ever testing for COVID-19, and this proportion was lower among those aged ≥ 60 years (p < 0.001). Prevalence of positive PCR results was 16.0%, higher among those aged 18-59 years (p < 0.009). Prevalence of positive antibody result was 10.0%, with no difference across age and comorbidity groups. Participants from areas/neighborhoods with higher Human Development Index (HDI) reported ever testing for SARS-CoV-2 more frequently than those from lower HDI areas. Interest to participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines candidates in Rio de Janeiro was significantly high. The online registry successfully reached out a large number of individuals with diverse sociodemographic, economic and clinical backgrounds."
142,"IgG Antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 Load, and Prognostic Indicators in Patients with Severe and Mild COVID-19 in Japan.","We assessed the association of severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) load, IgG antibody level, and prognostic indicators.Twenty-one patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were classified as having severe or mild disease on the basis of average respiratory rate during hospitalization (severe: ≥22 breaths/min; mild: <22 breaths/min). Viral load in nasopharyngeal samples, blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocytes, and D-dimer on admission and plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) index on Day 7±2 after symptom onset were compared in relation to disease severity. Seven patients had severe disease and 14 had mild disease. Those with severe disease had a significantly higher IgG index (median: 3.75 vs 0.56, p=0.01) and CRP (median: 8.6 vs 1.0 mg/dL, p<0.001) and D-dimer levels (median: 1.65 vs 0.75 μg/mL; p=0.002) and a significantly lower lymphocyte count (median: 1,176 vs 666 cells/μL, p=0.005) and viral load (median: 8.7×106 vs 2.3×104 copies/mL, p=0.005). Furthermore, time from symptom onset to virus disappearance was significantly longer in severe patients (median: 24 vs 17 days, p=0.03). A high IgG index in the early phase of the disease was associated with severe disease and might serve as a prognostic indicator."
143,Neutralizing Antibodies in COVID-19 Patients and Vaccine Recipients after Two Doses of BNT162b2.,"The evaluation of the neutralizing capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is important because they represent real protective immunity. In this study we aimed to measure and compare the neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients and in vaccinated individuals. One-hundred and fifty long-term samples from 75 COVID-19 patients were analyzed with a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) and compared to six different SARS-CoV-2 serology assays. The agreement between the sVNT and pseudovirus VNT (pVNT) results was found to be excellent (i.e., 97.2%). The NAb response was also assessed in 90 individuals who had received the complete dose regimen of BNT162b2. In COVID-19 patients, a stronger response was observed in moderate-severe versus mild patients (p-value = 0.0006). A slow decay in NAbs was noted in samples for up to 300 days after diagnosis, especially in moderate-severe patients (r = -0.35, p-value = 0.03). In the vaccinated population, 83.3% of COVID-19-naive individuals had positive NAbs 14 days after the first dose and all were positive 7 days after the second dose, i.e., at day 28. In previously infected individuals, all were already positive for NAbs at day 14. At each time point, a stronger response was observed for previously infected individuals (p-value < 0.05). The NAb response remained stable for up to 56 days in all participants. Vaccinated participants had significantly higher NAb titers compared to COVID patients. In previously infected vaccine recipients, one dose might be sufficient to generate sufficient neutralizing antibodies."
144,Clinical Performance of the Point-of-Care cobas Liat for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 Minutes: a Multicenter Study.,"Highly accurate testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the point of care (POC) is an unmet diagnostic need in emergency care and time-sensitive outpatient care settings. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) technology is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. We performed a multisite U.S. study comparing the clinical performance of the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized POC RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 min, the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B nucleic acid test, to the most widely used RT-PCR laboratory test, the cobas 68/8800 SARS-CoV-2 test. Clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 444 patients with 357 evaluable specimens at five U.S. clinical laboratories were enrolled from 21 September 2020 to 23 October 2020. The overall agreement between the Liat and 68/8800 systems for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics was 98.6% (352/357). Using Liat, positive percent agreement for SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (162/162) and the negative percent agreement was 97.4% (190/195). The Liat is an RT-PCR POC test that provides highly accurate SARS-CoV-2 results in 20 min with performance equivalent to that of high-throughput laboratory molecular testing. Rapid RT-PCR testing at the POC can enable more timely infection control and individual care decisions for coronavirus disease 2019."
145,"The performance of point-of-care antibody test for COVID-19 diagnosis in a tertiary hospital in Bandung, Indonesia.","Introduction: We aim to describe the performance of combined IgM and IgG point-of-care antibody test (POC-Ab) (Wondfo®) compared to real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) (Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay) in detecting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methodology: We compared POC-Ab with rRT-PCR results among patients in a tertiary hospital from January to March 2020 in Bandung, Indonesia. We selected presumptive COVID-19 patients with positive rRT-PCR consecutively and 20 patients with negative rRT-PCR results were selected randomly from the same group of patients as controls. We described the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) with corresponding 95% confidence interval using serum and capillary blood samples. We also tested POC-Ab using non-COVID-19 (confirmed dengue and typhoid) patients' sera. Results: Twenty-seven patients with positive rRT-PCR result and 20 negative controls were included (68.1% males, mean age 46 (SD: 15.4)). Using the serum, the sensitivity of the POC-Ab was 63.0% (42.4-80.6), specificity was 95.0% (75.1-99.9), PPV was 94.4% (72.7-99.8), NPV was 65.5% (45.7-82.1). A subset of 20 patients was tested using a capillary blood sample. The accuracy of the capillary blood sample is lower compared to serum (50.0% vs. 78.7%). None of the non-COVID-19 sera tested were reactive. Conclusions: POC-Ab for COVID-19 has a high specificity with no false-positive result in non-COVID-19 sera. Therefore, it can be used to guide diagnostic among symptomatic patients in resource limited settings. Given its low sensitivity, patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 but non-reactive result should be prioritized for rRT-PCR testing."
146,RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for point-of-care clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.,"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights the shortcomings of the current testing paradigm for viral disease diagnostics. Here, we report a stepwise protocol for an RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for rapid and naked-eye molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. The test employs a unique dual-prong approach that integrates nucleic acid (NA) amplification and plasmonic sensing for point-of-care detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a sample-to-assay response time of <1 h. The RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test utilizes plasmonic gold nanoparticles capped with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a colorimetric reporter to detect the amplified nucleic acid from the COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. The ASOs are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, and binding of the ASOs to their target sequence results in the aggregation of the plasmonic gold nanoparticles. This highly specific agglomeration step leads to a change in the plasmonic response of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, when tested using clinical samples, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be >98.4%, >96.6% and 100%, respectively, with a detection limit of 10 copies/μL. The test can easily be adapted to diagnose other viral infections with a simple modification of the ASOs and primer sequences. It also provides a low-cost, rapid approach requiring minimal instrumentation that can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at point-of-care settings in resource-poor situations. The colorimetric readout of the test can even be monitored using a handheld optical reader to obtain a quantitative response. Therefore, we anticipate that this protocol will be widely useful for the development of biosensors for the molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases."
147,When Clinicians Should Repeat RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2: Repeat PCR Testing in Patients with Pulmonary CT Findings Suggestive of COVID-19.,"Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are occasionally repeated when clinicians suspect false-negative results, but the conditions under which repeated RT-PCR testing is warranted remain unclear. We evaluated the practice of repeat RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in 45 patients who were retested after an initial negative PCR test. Of these, the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was confirmed in four patients with typical chest computed tomography (CT) findings and in one patient without typical CT findings in whom the test result was strongly suspected to be false-positive. We recommend repeat RT-PCR testing only for patients with typical CT findings of COVID-19."

149,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in an area of northeastern Italy with a high incidence of COVID-19 cases: a population-based study.,"Objectives: A seroprevalence study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was conducted in a high-incidence area located in northeastern Italy. Methods: All citizens above 10 years of age resident in five municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Trento, with the highest incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, were invited to participate in the study. Among 6098 participants, 6075 sera and a standardized questionnaire administered face-to-face were collected between 5 May and 15 May 2020 and examined. Symptomatic individuals and their family contacts were tested by RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using an Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, which was performed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR automated analyser. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive results among the total number tested. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to assess the relationship between seropositive versus seronegative individuals for a set of explanatory variables. Results: A total of 1402 participants were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a prevalence of 23.1% (1402/6075). The highest prevalence was found in the age class 40-49 years. Overall, 34.4% (2096/6098) of the participants reported at least one symptom. The ratio between reported cases identified by molecular test and those with seropositive results was 1:3, with a maximum ratio of about 1:7 in the age group <20 years and a minimum around 1:1 in those >70 years old. The infection fatality rate was 2.5% (35/1402). Among the symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity. Conclusions: The estimated seroprevalence of 23% was three-fold higher than the number of cases reported in the COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance data in the study area. This may be explained in part by a relatively high number of individuals presenting mild or no illness, especially those of younger age, and people who did not seek medical care or testing, but who may contribute to virus transmission in the community."
