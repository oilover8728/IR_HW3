8640,Recovering Coronavirus Disease Patients in the Active Duty Military Population: A Review of Current Evidence and Special Considerations for Uniformed Providers.,"Patients acutely infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may continue to have symptoms well beyond 2 weeks. The range of symptoms and physiological sequelae can impact medical readiness even in a relatively young and healthy cohort of service members. It is important to monitor, document, and investigate symptoms from all service members recovering from COVID-19. Military medicine must be prepared to support and manage cases of patients who are recovered from acute COVID-19 but are suffering from post-COVID-19 complications."
8641,SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in the general population and high-risk occupational groups across 18 cities in Iran: a population-based cross-sectional study.,"Background: Rapid increases in cases of COVID-19 were observed in multiple cities in Iran towards the start of the pandemic. However, the true infection rate remains unknown. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 18 cities of Iran as an indicator of the infection rate. Methods: In this population-based cross-sectional study, we randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (from lists of people registered with the Iranian electronic health record system or health-care centres) and a high-risk population of individuals likely to have close social contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals through their occupation (from employee lists provided by relevant agencies or companies, such as supermarket chains) across 18 cities in 17 Iranian provinces. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, recent COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19-related exposures. Iran Food and Drug Administration-approved Pishtaz Teb SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples from participants. Seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for population weighting (by age, sex, and city population size) and test performance (according to our independent validation of sensitivity and specificity). Findings: From 9181 individuals who were initially contacted between April 17 and June 2, 2020, 243 individuals refused to provide blood samples and 36 did not provide demographic information and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 8902 individuals included in the analysis, 5372 had occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and 3530 were recruited from the general population. The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity in the general population was 17·1% (95% CI 14·6-19·5), implying that 4 265 542 (95% CI 3 659 043-4 887 078) individuals from the 18 cities included were infected by the end of April, 2020. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies varied greatly by city, with the highest estimates found in Rasht (72·6% [53·9-92·8]) and Qom (58·5% [37·2-83·9]). The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted seroprevalence in the high-risk population was 20·0% (18·5-21·7) and showed little variation between the occupations included. Interpretations: Seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported prevalence of COVID-19 based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite high seroprevalence in a few cities, a large proportion of the population is still uninfected. The potential shortcomings of current public health policies should therefore be identified to prevent future epidemic waves in Iran. Funding: Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

8642,COVID-19-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Lessons from Tissues and Cells.,"Reports examining lung histopathology in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection provide an essential body of information for clinicians and investigators. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced lung injury is complex, involving the airways, alveoli, and pulmonary vessels. Although no anatomic marker is specific, the signature histologic lesion is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The biological and molecular mechanisms that drive this pattern of injury are unknown, and the relationship of SARS-CoV-2-induced DAD to physiologic alterations and clinical outcomes in COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome is undefined. Additional histologic patterns that may be variant phenotypes have been reported."
8643,"Using Serologic Testing to Assess the Effectiveness of Outbreak Control Efforts, Serial Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing, and Cohorting of Positive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Patients in a Skilled Nursing Facility.","We characterized serology following a nursing home outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) where residents were serially tested by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and positive residents were cohorted. When tested 46-76 days later, 24 of 26 RT-PCR-positive residents were seropositive; none of the 124 RT-PCR-negative residents had confirmed seropositivity, supporting serial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing and cohorting in nursing homes."
8644,Central Nervous System Manifestations Associated with COVID-19.,"Purpose of review: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health crisis of our time. The disease arises from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells for its internalization. COVID-19 has a wide range of respiratory symptoms from mild to severe and affects several other organs, increasing the complexity of the treatment. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can target the nervous system. In this review, we provide an account of the COVID-19 central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. Recent findings: A broad spectrum of the CNS manifestations including headache, impaired consciousness, delirium, loss of smell and taste, encephalitis, seizures, strokes, myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neurogenic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, silent hypoxemia, generalized myoclonus, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Kawasaki syndrome has been reported in patients with COVID-19. CNS manifestations associated with COVID-19 should be considered in clinical practice. There is a need for modification of current protocols and standing orders to provide better care for COVID-19 patients presenting with neurological symptoms."
8645,Cyanorona-20: The first potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent.,"Explicit hindrance and blockade of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered one of the most promising and efficient approaches for developing highly potent remedies for COVID-19. However, almost all of the reported viral RdRp inhibitors (either repurposed or new antiviral drugs) lack specific selectivity against the novel coronaviral RdRp and still at a beginning phase of advancement. Herein, I discovered and introduce a new pyrazine derivative, (E)-N-(4-cyanobenzylidene)-6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (cyanorona-20), as the first potent SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor with very high selectivity (209- and 45-fold more potent than favipiravir and remdesivir, respectively). This promising selective specific anti-COVID-19 compound is also deemed to be the first distinctive derivative of favipiravir. Cyanorona-20, the unprecedented nucleoside/nucleotide analog, was designed, synthesized, characterized, computationally studied, and biologically evaluated for its anti-COVID-19 actions (through a precise in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay). The results of the biological assay displayed that cyanorona-20 surprisingly exhibited very high and largely significant anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.45 μM), and, in addition, it could be also a very promising guide and lead compound for the design and synthesis of new anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-COVID-19 agents through structural modifications and further computational studies. Further appraisal for the improvement of cyanorona-20 medication is a prerequisite requirement in the coming days. In a word, the ascent of the second member (cyanorona-20 ""Corona Antidote"") of the novel and promising class of anti-COVID-19 pyrazine derivatives would drastically make a medical uprising in the pharmacotherapeutic treatment regimens and protocols of the recently-emerged SARS-CoV-2 infection and its accompanying COVID-19."
8646,Follow-up care after COVID-19 and its related concerns.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). Overall COVID-19-related rates of mortality are low; deaths usually occur in patients older than 60 and those suffering from serious chronic diseases. Most of the patients recover within one or two weeks. However, in approximately 5-10 % of the patients some of the symptoms persist for weeks and months. Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a multisystem disease with overlapping symptoms and may occur even in patients who were relatively mildly affected during the acute phase of the disease. Evaluating the number of patients with or after the novel coronavirus infection in the Czech Republic, it can be estimated that in the next months there will be about 50,000 new patients suffering from long-COVID-19 requiring attention of general practitioners in the least, and, in all probability, also of other medical specialists. A thorough knowledge of the syndrome and efficient ideally evidence-based guidelines have to be formulated to combat the adverse impact of the pandemic."
8647,Maintaining proper health records improves machine learning predictions for novel 2019-nCoV.,"Background: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia continues to affect the whole world including major countries such as China, USA, Italy, France and the United Kingdom. We present outcome ('recovered', 'isolated' or 'death') risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over 'early' datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. Method: Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used 'country', 'age' and 'gender' as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient's 'disease' history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. Results: The use of a patient's 'disease' history improves the prediction of 'death' by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent's 'disease' history performed poorly in test predictions. Conclusion: Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient's 'disease' history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions. This development can have a positive effect on predictive patient treatment and can result in easing currently overburdened healthcare systems worldwide, especially with the increasing prevalence of second and third wave re-infections in some countries."
8648,Intersecting Paths of Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shares common clinicopathologic features with other severe pulmonary illnesses. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was diagnosed in 2 patients in Arizona, USA, suspected of dying from infection with SARS-CoV-2. Differential diagnoses and possible co-infections should be considered for cases of respiratory distress during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."
8649,Emergence of SARS-COV-2 Spike Protein Escape Mutation Q493R after Treatment for COVID-19.,We report in vivo selection of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike mutation (Q493R) conferring simultaneous resistance to bamlanivimab and etesivimab. This mutation was isolated from a patient who had coronavirus disease and was treated with these drugs.
