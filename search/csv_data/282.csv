2810,Cord blood antibody following maternal SARS-CoV-2 inactive vaccine (CoronaVac) administration during the pregnancy.,"Maternal vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has not been well studied yet in terms of safety and efficacy for protecting the newborn by the placental passage of antibodies. We reported 34 years of old health care worker (HCW) without any known SARS-CoV-2 infection. She had the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 inactivated virus vaccine (CoronaVac, Sinovac Life Science Co, Ltd, Beijing, China) at a gestational age of 28 weeks. The second dose of vaccine was given four weeks later at a gestational age of 32 weeks. HCW did not report any vaccine-related adverse events after either the first or second dose of the vaccine. Three weeks after the second dose of the vaccine, her anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody was 779 arbitrary units (AU) per ml. She gave a birth of 38 weeks three days gestation age of healthy, full-term girl with a birth weight of 2770 gr. The mother's anti-RBD antibody was 734 AU/ml, the infant's cord blood anti-RBD antibody level was 764 AU/ml, respectively, cord sera/maternal sera transfer ratio was 1,04. This infant is the first identified case of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detectable in cord blood after maternal vaccination with CoronaVac."

2813,"Self-collection and pooling of samples as resources-saving strategies for RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, the example of travelers in French Polynesia.","In French Polynesia, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected on March 10th, 2020, in a resident returning from France. Between March 28th and July 14th, international air traffic was interrupted and local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was brought under control, with only 62 cases recorded. The main challenge for reopening the air border without requiring travelers to quarantine on arrival was to limit the risk of re-introducing SARS-CoV-2. Specific measures were implemented, including the obligation for all travelers to have a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 carried out within 3 days before departure, and to perform another RT-PCR testing 4 days after arrival. Because of limitation in available medical staff, travelers were provided a kit allowing self-collection of oral and nasal swabs. In addition to increase our testing capacity, self-collected samples from up to 10 travelers were pooled before RNA extraction and RT-PCR testing. When a pool tested positive, RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed on each individual sample. We report here the results of COVID-19 surveillance (COV-CHECK PORINETIA) conducted between July 15th, 2020, and February 15th, 2021, in travelers using self-collection and pooling approaches. We tested 5,982 pools comprising 59,490 individual samples, and detected 273 (0.46%) travelers positive for SARS-CoV-2. A mean difference of 1.17 Ct (CI 95% 0.93-1.41) was found between positive individual samples and pools (N = 50), probably related to the volume of samples used for RNA extraction (200 μL versus 50 μL, respectively). Retrospective testing of positive samples self-collected from October 20th, 2020, using variants-specific amplification kit and spike gene sequencing, found at least 6 residents infected by the Alpha variant. Self-collection and pooling approaches allowed large-scale screening for SARS-CoV-2 using less human, material and financial resources. Moreover, this strategy allowed detecting the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in French Polynesia."
2814,Coronavirus lockdown helped the environment to bounce back.,"As the transmission of novel corona virus (COVID-19) increases rapidly, the whole world adopted the curfew/lockdown activity with restriction of human mobility. The imposition of quarantine stopped all the commercial activity that greatly affects the various important environmental parameters which directly connected to human health. As all the types of social, economic, industrial and urbanization activity suddenly shut off, nature takes the advantages and showed improvement in the quality of air, cleaner rivers, less noise pollution, undisturbed and calm wildlife. This research aims to discuss the COVID-19 effect on the global environment. The outcome of this research says that ""Although coronavirus vaccine is not available coronavirus itself is earth's vaccine and us humans are the virus""."

2816,Non-human primate models of human respiratory infections.,"Respiratory pathogens represent a great burden for humanity and a potential source of new pandemics, as illustrated by the recent emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In recent decades, biotechnological advances have led to the development of numerous innovative therapeutic molecules and vaccine immunogens. However, we still lack effective treatments and vaccines against many respiratory pathogens. More than ever, there is a need for a fast, predictive, preclinical pipeline, to keep pace with emerging diseases. Animal models are key for the preclinical development of disease management strategies. The predictive value of these models depends on their ability to reproduce the features of the human disease, the mode of transmission of the infectious agent and the availability of technologies for monitoring infection. This review focuses on the use of non-human primates as relevant preclinical models for the development of prevention and treatment for human respiratory infections."
2817,Saliva as a possible tool for the SARS-CoV-2 detection: A review.,"Background: Salivary tests for the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) diagnosis have been suggested as alternative methods for the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tests. Method: Two reviewers independently performed a search in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus to identify cross-sectional and cohort studies that used saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The search strategy was: (""saliva"") and (""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""coronavirus"" or ""COVID-1""). Results: A total of 363 studies were identified and 39 were selected for review. Salivary samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection was as consistent and sensitive as the nasopharyngeal swabs in most studies, having been effective in detecting asymptomatic infections previously tested negative in nasopharyngeal samples. Viral nucleic acids found in saliva obtained from the duct of the salivary gland may indicate infection in that gland. Live viruses could be detected in saliva by viral culture. Conclusions: Salivary samples show great potential in SARS-CoV-2 detection and may be recommended as a simple and non-invasive alternative."
