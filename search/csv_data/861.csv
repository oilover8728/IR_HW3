8600,COVID-19 Australia: Epidemiology Report 26: Fortnightly reporting period ending 27 September 2020.,"Cumulatively to 27 September there have been 27,095 case notifications and 835 deaths. The number of new cases reported nationally this fortnight was 278, a 67% decrease from the previous fortnight (841). On average, this represented 20 cases notified each day over the reporting period, a decrease from an average of 60 cases per day over the previous reporting period. 82% of all COVID-19 cases for the period (229/278) were reported in Victoria, with smaller numbers of cases reported from New South Wales (32), Western Australia (9), Queensland (6) and South Australia (2). In Victoria, 92% of cases (210/229) were locally acquired with known source, 7% (15/229) were locally acquired with unknown source, and 2% (4/229) were reported as under investigation. Excluding Victoria, there were 49 cases in other jurisdictions. Of these, 69% (34/49) were overseas acquired, 18% (9/49) were locally acquired, and 12% (10/49) were under investigation at this time. The continued decrease in new cases observed this fortnight in Victoria was the result of the public health interventions to minimise transmission. A total of 8 deaths were reported from cases diagnosed in this reporting period, all of whom were >75 years old, and all from Victoria. Although testing rates declined over the past month, they remain high at 10.4 tests per 1,000 population per week. There is variability in the testing rate by jurisdiction; the rate depends on the epidemic context. The overall positivity rate for the reporting period was 0.08%. Victoria reported a positivity rate of 0.18% for this reporting period, while in all other jurisdictions the positivity rate was 0.05% or lower."
8601,Fulminant H1N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections with a 4-year interval without an identifiable underlying cause: a case report.,"Background: The clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection is highly variable from asymptomatic infection to fulminant disease. The reasons for the variation are only starting to unravel, with risk factors including age and certain comorbidities as well as genetic defects causing immunological perturbations in the interferon pathways. Case presentation: We report the case of an otherwise healthy Caucasian man, who at ages 60 and 64 years suffered from severe H1N1 influenza virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections, respectively. In both cases, there were acute kidney impairment and the need for intensive care unit admission as well as mechanical ventilation. Fortunately, after both infections there was full clinical recovery. The severity of the infections indicates an underlying impairment in the ability to control these kinds of infections. Challenge of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed impaired type I and III antiviral interferon responses and reduced interferon-stimulated gene expression. However, despite investigation of patient samples by whole exome sequencing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, no known disease-causing genetic variants related to interferon pathways were found, nor were interferon autoantibodies demonstrated. Thus, any underlying immunological cause of this unusual susceptibility to severe viral infections remains unresolved. Conclusion: The patient experienced very similar severe clinical pictures triggered by H1N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections, indicating an underlying inability to contain these infections. We were unable to show that the patient had any of the currently known types of immune incompetence but identified genetic changes possibly contributing to the severe course of both infections. Further analyses to delineate contribution factors are needed."

8603,[Allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines: evidence and practice-oriented approach].,"Less than a year after the first detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), vaccines have been approved for routine use in numerous countries and have already been used in mass vaccination programs. Vaccines include the mRNA BNT162b2 and mRNA 1273. Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis account for a substantial proportion of the adverse reactions to these vaccines observed to date, but overall they are rare. The incidence of anaphylaxis in the context of SARS-CoVâ€‘2 vaccination with the mRNA vaccines appears to be approximately 10-fold higher than with previous vaccines, at approximately 1 per 100,000 vaccine injections. One focus of the present article is a systematic review of the components of mRNA vaccines against "" coronavirus disease 2019 "" (COVID-19). Differences from established vaccines are addressed and the allergic potential of liposomes, polyethylene glycol, tromethamine/trometamol, and mRNA are discussed. Another focus is on the clinical presentation and course of allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines. This is followed by a discussion of the therapeutic approach to anaphylactic reactions, as well as the drugs and medical supplies required to treat them. It is important to note that any vaccinee may be affected by anaphylaxis, regardless of whether or not allergic diseases are already known. Therefore, every vaccination site and every vaccinator must be prepared to recognize and treat severe allergic reactions."
8604,There is a Role in Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Conjunctiva and Tears: a comprehensive review.,"Data on the involvement of the ocular surface and its relationship with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) are still minimal and not univocal. The respiratory tract is the structure most affected by COVID-19, and the serious form of the disease is characterized by severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and hypercoagulation. However, accumulating evidence shows that other organs could be reached by the virus, thus causing further comorbidities. To date, the exact route/routes of transmission of COVID-19 are still unclear. The respiratory tract is probably not the only route of transmission for this viral infection and some authors have also speculated that COVID-19 droplets, or infected hands, could contaminate the conjunctiva, which could therefore represent the initial site of an infection spread. Theoretically, the role of the ocular surface, a biological site still relatively unexplored, appears scientifically relevant in understanding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the current literature in order to elucidate the potential role of tear and conjunctival sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to monitor patients during follow-up."
8605,Proof of Concept for a Quick and Highly Sensitive On-Site Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Plasmonic Optical Fibers and Molecularly Imprinted Polymers.,"The rapid spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen has generated a huge international public health emergency. Currently the reference diagnostic technique for virus determination is Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) real time analysis that requires specialized equipment, reagents and facilities and typically 3-4 h to perform. Thus, the realization of simple, low-cost, small-size, rapid and point-of-care diagnostics tests has become a global priority. In response to the current need for quick, highly sensitive and on-site detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in several aqueous solutions, a specific molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) receptor has been designed, realized, and combined with an optical sensor. More specifically, the proof of concept of a SARS-CoV-2 sensor has been demonstrated by exploiting a plasmonic plastic optical fiber sensor coupled with a novel kind of synthetic MIP nano-layer, especially designed for the specific recognition of Subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. First, we have tested the effectiveness of the developed MIP receptor to bind the Subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, then the results of preliminary tests on SARS-CoV-2 virions, performed on samples of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs in universal transport medium (UTM) and physiological solution (0.9% NaCl), were compared with those obtained with RT-PCR. According to these preliminary results, the sensitivity of the proposed optical-chemical sensor proved to be higher than the RT-PCR one. Furthermore, a relatively fast response time (about 10 min) to the virus was obtained without the use of additional reagents."
8606,Structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles degrades with temperature.,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Other known coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more prominent in winter. Although several plausible origins of such seasonal variability have been proposed, its mechanism is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures. We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is applied in the dry state. This is consistent with other existing non-mechanistic studies of viral infectivity, provides a single particle perspective on viral seasonality, and strengthens the case for a resurgence of COVID-19 in winter."
8607,Remote management of dental problems in children during and post the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak: A teledentistry approach.,"The recent pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created a helpless situation in healthcare systems worldwide. The disease can be transmitted in different ways, e.g., through contact, droplets, fomites, and aerosol-generating procedures. Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) released recommendations regarding precautions to be taken by all healthcare workers, including dentists, in order to avoid the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 indeed has become a pandemic, and there is a need for an innovative method to continue providing dental care to children with a minimal risk of cross-infection. The objective of this short communication was to draw special attention to the teledentistry model in pediatric dentistry and to guide the management of children with dental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teledentistry is a feasible method and its use can overcome challenges in the present situation. The teledentistry approach enables providing guidance, treatment plans and follow-up with remote-assistance dental care through the use of information technology instead of face-to-face contact with patients."
8608,Hyaluronic acid soft tissue filler delayed inflammatory reaction following COVID-19 vaccination - A case report.,"Background: The use of hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers in aesthetic medicine exploded in recent years for many reasons, including being relatively safe. Incidence of delayed inflammatory reactions (DIRs) to hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers range between 0.3% and 4.25%. These reactions are mediated by T-lymphocytes and can be triggered by flu-like illnesses, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination may also induce hypersensitivity. Aim: In this case report, we present two cases of delayed reaction after hyaluronic acid soft tissue filler treatment of the tear trough area and following mRNA vaccination against SARS-Cov-2, also known as COVID-19, months later. Patients: A 39-year old female who previously had her tear trough area treated with hyaluronic acid soft tissue filler developed swelling days after getting the mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Another patient, a 61-year-olf female, developed intermittent facial swelling in areas previously treated with hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers days after receiving her first dose of the mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Results: As demonstrated in our case report, vaccination against COVID-19 may induce DIRs in patients who previously had hyaluronic soft tissue fillers. Conclusion: Delayed inflammatory reactions to hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers are uncommon and usually self-limited, with frequent spontaneous resolution. However, considering the ongoing pandemic and the worldwide demand for vaccines against COVID-19, the aesthetic providers should be conscious of the risks posed by the interaction of such vaccines in patients who previously had or seeking hyaluronic acid soft tissue filler injections."
8609,"A comprehensive profile of genomic variations in the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the state of Telangana, India.","The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 has rapidly turned into a pandemic, infecting millions and causing 1 157 509 (as of 27 October 2020) deaths across the globe. In addition to studying the mode of transmission and evasion of host immune system, analysing the viral mutational landscape constitutes an area under active research. The latter is expected to impart knowledge on the emergence of different clades, subclades, viral protein functions and protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions during replication/transcription cycle of virus and response to host immune checkpoints. In this study, we have attempted to bring forth the viral genomic variants defining the major clade(s) as identified from samples collected from the state of Telangana, India. We further report a comprehensive draft of all genomic variations (including unique mutations) present in SARS-CoV-2 strain in the state of Telangana. Our results reveal the presence of two mutually exclusive subgroups defined by specific variants within the dominant clade present in the population. This work attempts to bridge the critical gap regarding the genomic landscape and associate mutations in SARS-CoV-2 from a highly infected southern region of India, which was lacking to date."
