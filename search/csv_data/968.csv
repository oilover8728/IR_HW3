9670,"Environment and COVID-19: Pollutants, impacts, dissemination, management and recommendations for facing future epidemic threats.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Its relationship with environmental factors is an issue that has attracted the attention of scientists and governments. This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of ""one health"" approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in future epidemic threats."

9672,Tracking COVID-19 via sewage.,"Purpose of review: We discuss the potential role of the faecal chain in COVID-19 and highlight recent studies using waste water-based epidemiology (WBE) to track severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent findings: WBE has been suggested as an adjunct to improve disease surveillance and aid early detection of circulating disease. SARS-CoV-2, the aetiological agent of COVID-19, is an enveloped virus, and as such, typically not associated with the waste water environment, given high susceptibility to degradation in aqueous conditions. A review of the current literature supports the ability to detect of SARS-CoV-2 in waste water and suggests methods to predict community prevalence based on viral quantification. Summary: The summary of current practices shows that while the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 is possible from waste water, issues remain regarding the efficacy of virial concentration and subsequent quantification and alignment with epidemiological data."

9674,Public Health Emergency and Crisis Management: Case Study of SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused an unparalleled public health crisis, delivering an immense shock to humanity. With the virus's health consequences largely unknown, different health systems around the globe have pursued various avenues of crisis management. South Korea, troubled early by the virus, was once the second most affected nation in the world. Arrays of measures in South Korea, such as large-scale diagnostic testing and technology-based comprehensive contact tracing, have brought about debates among public health experts and medical professionals. This case study describes the major cluster transmissions in SARS-CoV-2 hotspots in South Korea (such as a religious sect, a call center, logistics facilities, and nightclubs) and offers early observations on how South Korean public health authorities acted in response to the initial outbreak of the virus and to the new waves prompted by re-opening economies. We then discuss the way in which South Korea's experience can act as a reference for shaping other countries' public health strategies in pandemic crisis management."
9675,Attitudes of school teachers toward influenza and COVID-19 vaccine in Greece during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Our study aims to assess the attitudes, knowledge, and influenza vaccine uptake of school teachers, the intention to uptake influenza vaccine as well as the COVID-19 vaccine and to identify factors associated with vaccine acceptance during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among elementary and kindergarten school teachers in the area of Western Greece from June 2020 to August 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed via an internet-based link along with an invitation e-mail. Responses from 399 participants were retrieved. 139 (34.8%) had received the annual influenza vaccine in the season 2019-2020, whereas 215 (53.9%) stated that they would get it in the forthcoming season 2020-2021 (p < .001). 152 (38.1%) intent to get the COVID-19 vaccine when available. For COVID-19 vaccine factors that were independently associated with the intention to uptake included more than 15 years at work (p = .001), prior influenza vaccine uptake (p = .003), believing that COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory (p = .04) and that school teachers are a high-risk group for COVID-19 (p = .001). In conclusion, COVID-19 pandemic appeared to have an impact on the intention of school teachers to get vaccinated for influenza. The low level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance intention among the teachers in our cohort warrants further attention. Public health interventions should aim to increase knowledge on both influenza and COVID-19 and prevention of them via immunization in this particular at-risk population."
9676,[Editorial] Possibility of transmission through dogs being a contributing factor to the extreme Covid-19 outbreak in North Italy.,"Covid‑19 origin and transmission to humans. Covid‑19 infection began in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December, 2019. Although to date it is considered that Covid‑19 originates from bats (96.2% overall genome sequence identity) (1), the type of intermediate animals that caused the transmission to humans remains unknown (2-4). Zhou et al (1) mentioned that 'Direct contact with intermediate host animals or consumption of wild animals was suspected to be the main route of SARS‑CoV‑2 transmission. However, the source(s) and transmission routine(s) of SARS‑CoV‑2 remain elusive' (1)."
9677,The renin-angiotensin system and specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a potential therapeutic target in SARS-CoV-2 infections.,"In March 2019, the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus began. The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in November 19 in Wuhan, China. Preventive measures taken have not prevented the rapid spread of the virus to countries around the world. To date, there are approximately 3 million deaths, and a massive worldwide vaccination campaign has recently begun. SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE-2 protein as an intracellular carrier. ACE-2 is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a key regulator of cardiovascular function. Considering the key role of ACE-2 in COVID-19 infection, both as an entry receptor and as a protective role, especially for the respiratory tract, and considering the variations of ACE-2 during the phases of viral infection, it is clear the important role that pharmacological regulation of RAS and ACE-2 may take. In this article, we describe the importance of ACE-2 in COVID-19 infection, the pharmacological aspects of a modulation with RAS-modifying agents, new therapeutic strategies, trying to provide a deep understanding and explanation of the complex mechanisms underlying the relationship between the virus and ACE-2, providing opinions and personal hypotheses on the best strategies of therapeutic intervention."
9678,Thin-film-transistor digital microfluidics for high value in vitro diagnostics at the point of need.,"The latest developments in thin-film-transistor digital-microfluidics (TFT-DMF, also known by the commercial name aQdrop™) are reported, and proof of concept application to molecular diagnostics (e.g. for coronavirus disease, COVID-19) at the point-of-need demonstrated. The TFT-DMF array has 41 thousand independently addressable electrodes that are capable of manipulating large numbers of droplets of any size and shape, along any pathway to perform multiple parallel reactions. Droplets are continually tracked and adjusted through closed-loop feedback enabled by TFT based sensors at each array element. The sample-to-answer molecular in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) includes nucleic acid extractions from saliva, removal of dsDNA and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This proof of concept illustrates how the highly configurable TFT-DMF technology can perform many reactions in parallel and thus support the processing of a range of sample types followed by multiple complex multi-step assays."
9679,Sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus and its role in the spread of COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol.,"Objective: To provide a review of the literature on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the sexual fluids of patients with COVID-19 and to observe its possible sexual transmission in a timely, rigorous, and continuously updated manner. Data sources: We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods: We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomized trials evaluating the sexual transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Randomized trials evaluating the sexual transmission of other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomized studies in COVID-19 will be searched if no direct evidence from randomized trials is found or if the direct evidence provides a low to a very low level of certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit the review if the conclusions change or if there are substantial updates. Prospero registration: (CRD42020189368)."
