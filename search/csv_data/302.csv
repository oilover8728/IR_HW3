3011,Saliva: an important alternative for screening and monitoring of COVID-19 in children.,"The increasing number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide poses challenges to healthcare systems not only in effectively identifying individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2, but also in isolating cases to minimise contagion in early diagnosing more severe cases that will need hospitalization. Less-invasive collection methods are indispensable in a pandemic scenario as large-scale tests are necessary to understand the actual evolution of contagion in different populations, thus enabling decision-making based on scientific evidence. Saliva has been shown to be an alternative for diagnosing viral infections as this biological fluid can be easily and quickly collected without using specific devices and causing less discomfort during collection, which is an important factor for use in children. Despite the smaller percentage of severe cases of COVID-19 among children, they seem to play an important role in the contagion as they have the same potential of transmission as that of adults. Knowing the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in children is extremely important, mainly regarding the changing in rules of social distancing, such as re-opening schools and recreational activities spaces. In addition, countless cases of a severe multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome that shares clinical and laboratory features with Kawasaki's disease have been recently related to SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, adolescents and young adults. In view of this scenario, the aim of this study was to present saliva as an alternative for seeking diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID-19 in children, including adequate sample collection techniques for different age groups."
3012,Impact of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs on vaccine immunogenicity in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases.,"Patients with rheumatic diseases are at increased risk of infectious complications; vaccinations are a critical component of their care. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs may reduce the immunogenicity of common vaccines. We will review here available data regarding the effect of these medications on influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, SARS-CoV-2, hepatitis B, human papilloma virus and yellow fever vaccines. Rituximab has the most substantial impact on vaccine immunogenicity, which is most profound when vaccinations are given at shorter intervals after rituximab dosing. Methotrexate has less substantial effect but appears to adversely impact most vaccine immunogenicity. Abatacept likely decrease vaccine immunogenicity, although these studies are limited by the lack of adequate control groups. Janus kinase and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors decrease absolute antibody titres for many vaccines, but do not seem to significantly impact the proportions of patients achieving seroprotection. Other biologics (interleukin-6R (IL-6R), IL-12/IL-23 and IL-17 inhibitors) have little observed impact on vaccine immunogenicity. Data regarding the effect of these medications on the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity are just now emerging, and early glimpses appear similar to our experience with other vaccines. In this review, we summarise the most recent data regarding vaccine response and efficacy in this setting, particularly in light of current vaccination recommendations for immunocompromised patients."

3015,Systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with re-positive viral RNA after recovery from COVID-19.,"Previous studies reported the positive viral RNA among coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) recovered patients. This study aimed to summarize the current evidence of factors associated with the risk of disease recurrence. PubMed and Embase were searched until September 2020 to identify studies assessing characteristics of recurrence and nonrecurrence subjects after discharge. Random-effect meta-analysis was used to pool estimates of odds ratio (OR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across studies. Meta-analysis data were available for age, sex, hospital duration, disease severity, seven comorbidities, five symptoms, five indexes of blood routine, nine indexes of blood biochemistry, four treatment therapies, two antibodies, and history of high-risk contact. Among them, hospital duration of recurrence cases was significantly shorter than nonrecurrence subjects (WMD, -1.55 days; 95% CI, -2.66 to -0.45). Fatigue, positive Immunoglobulin M (IgM), and positive IgG were associated with an increased risk of recurrence cases, with ORs and 95% CIs of 4.06 (1.14-14.4), 2.95 (1.15-7.61), and 3.45 (1.58-7.54), respectively. In contrast, the odds of recurrence cases were observed to significantly lower in subjects with elevated lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein, low lymphocyte count, steroid and arbidol use, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.08 (0.27-4.37), 0.49 (0.27-0.97), 0.64 (0.42-0.97), 0.48 (0.25-0.96), and 0.48 (0.25-0.92), respectively. This study provided up-to-date evidence of several clinical and epidemiological characteristics in the association with COVID-19 recurrence cases. Further in-depth analyses for the causal effect of factors on re-positive viral RNA are needed for the management of discharged patients with COVID-19."

3017,"Is naso-pharyngeal swab always safe for SARS-CoV-2 testing? An unusual, accidental foreign body swallowing.","Long and sharp objects can be foreign body intentionally or accidentally ingested. Timing of endoscopy relies on foreign body shape and size, localization in gastrointestinal tract, patient's clinical conditions, occurrence of symptoms, or onset of complications. We present a case of a 47-year-old male with no known comorbidity, who accidentally swallowed a portion of a naso-pharyngeal swab half-broken during the second diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2. The intact swab had a total length of 15 cm and was made of wood. The patient was asymptomatic, laboratory tests were normal, and neck-chest-abdominal X-ray and CT scan were negative for major complications. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was promptly performed to prevent the long sharp swab from crossing the pylorus leading to serious complications and, therefore, risk surgical intervention. The patient was intubated and the procedure was carried out under general anesthesia. In the gastric body, broken naso-pharyngeal swab was detected among the food debris, and using a latex rubber hood, the 7.5 cm foreign body was removed with a retrieval alligator-tooth forceps. Our hospital is located in a high-risk area of COVID-19 outbreak where many naso-pharyngeal swabs are performed, and to our knowledge, this is the first report of swab ingestion during SARS-CoV-2 test."
