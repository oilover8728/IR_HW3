7030,Validation Checklist for Massive Vaccination Centers.,"Starting from the minimum requirements indicated by Lombardy Region, a validation checklist has been developed by experts in design, healthcare layout planning, hygiene and public health, planning and compliance, in order to provide managers of COVID-19 massive vaccination centers with a useful and easy-to-use tool to ensure quality, safety and efficiency of the different activities performed."
7031,SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia in children: An Iranian referral hospital-based study.,"Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is generally detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, viral RNA can be found in other samples including blood. Recently, associations between SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia and disease severity and mortality have been reported in adults, while no reports are available in pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to evaluate the mortality, severity, clinical, and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in blood in 96 pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19. Among all patients, 6 (6%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia. Out of the six patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, four (67%) had a severe form of the disease, and two out of the 6 patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia passed away (33%). Our results show that the symptoms more commonly found in the cases of COVID-19 in the study (fever, cough, tachypnea, and vomiting), were found at a higher percentage in the patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia. Creatine phosphokinase and magnesium tests showed significant differences between the positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia groups. Among all laboratory tests, magnesium and creatine phosphokinase could better predict SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with area under the curve levels of 0.808 and 0.748, respectively. In conclusion, 67% of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia showed a severe COVID-19 and one-third of the patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia passed away. Our findings suggest that magnesium and creatine phosphokinase might be considered as markers to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia."
7032,Performance of the rapid high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay targeting total antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain in comparison to the neutralization assay.,"Background: Neutralization tests (NT) are the gold standard for detecting and quantifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAb), but their complexity restricts them to research settings or reference laboratories. Antibodies against S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) have been shown to confer a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Assays quantitatively measuring anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be of great value for NAb screening of potential donors for convalescent-phase plasma therapy, assessing natural or vaccine-induced immunity, stratifying individuals for vaccine receipt, and documenting vaccine response. Methods: Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S), a high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence double-antigen sandwich immunoassay for quantitative measurement of pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, was evaluated against NT on 357 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NT was performed in a BSL-3 laboratory using a Slovenian SARS-CoV-2 isolate; the NT titer ≥1:20 was considered positive. Results: Elecsys-S detected pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 352/357 (98.6 %) samples. NAb were identified by NT in 257/357 (72 %) samples. The Elecsys-S/NT agreement was moderate (Cohen's kappa 0.56). High NT titer antibodies (≥1:160) were detected in 106/357 (30 %) samples. Elecsys-S's pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations correlated with individual NT titer categories (the lowest concentrations were identified in NT-negative samples and the highest in samples with NT titer 1:1,280), and the Elecsys-S cutoff value for reasonable prediction of NAb generated after natural infection was established (133 BAU/mL). Conclusion: Although NT should remain the gold standard for assessing candidates for convalescent-phase plasma donors, selected commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays with optimized cutoff, like Elecsys-S, could be used for rapid, automated, and large-scale screening of individuals with clinically relevant NAb levels as suitable donors."
7033,Different longitudinal patterns of nucleic acid and serology testing results based on disease severity of COVID-19 patients.,"Effective strategy to mitigate the ongoing pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) require a comprehensive understanding of humoral responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the emerging virus causing COVID-19. The dynamic profile of viral replication and shedding along with viral antigen specific antibody responses among COVID-19 patients started to be reported but there is no consensus on their patterns. Here, we conducted a serial investigation on 21 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in two medical centres from Jiangsu Province, including 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients, and 5 severe COVID-19 patients and 5 asymptomatic carriers based on nucleic acid test and clinical symptoms. The longitudinal swab samples and sera were collected from these people for viral RNA testing and antibody responses, respectively. Our data revealed different pattern of seroconversion among these groups. All 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients and 5 severe COVID-19 patients were seroconverted during hospitalization or follow-up period, suggesting that serological testing is a complementary assay to nucleic acid test for those symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Of note, immediate antibody responses were identified among severe cases, compared to non-severe cases. On the other hand, only one were seroconverted for asymptomatic carriers. The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses were well-maintained during the observation period. Such information is of immediate relevance and would assist COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, prognosis and vaccine design."
7034,The effect of the D614G substitution on the structure of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.,"The majority of currently circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viruses have mutant spike glycoproteins that contain the D614G substitution. Several studies have suggested that spikes with this substitution are associated with higher virus infectivity. We use cryo-electron microscopy to compare G614 and D614 spikes and show that the G614 mutant spike adopts a range of more open conformations that may facilitate binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and the subsequent structural rearrangements required for viral membrane fusion."
7035,[Application of convalescent plasma therapy on novel coronavirus infection].,"Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) caused by 2019-nCoV was in an outbreak globally. A large number of severe cases lead to strong clinical pressure even treated actively. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy refers to a therapy infusing plasma from recovered donors into other infected individuals. It has played an important role in conquering variety of epidemics over a century with some limitations. Considering the absence of specific treatments, CP has been used for treating COVID-19 and achieved some efficacies. This article provides a reference for clinical application of CP therapy in COVID-19, by discussing the history, mechanism and application of CP therapy in viral diseases such as SARS."
7036,Dentistry and Covid-19 pandemic: operative indications post-lockdown.,"A new Coronavirus, the seventh member of the Coronaviridae family, identified as SARS-CoV-2, spread in late December 2019 in the territory of Wuhan in China. CoV-2019 can be transmitted directly from person to person by respiratory drops, direct contact and contaminated material. Furthermore, 2019-nCov penetrates cells similarly to the SARS coronavirus, i.e., through the ACE2 receptor. This may promote human-to-human transmission. Patients and dental professionals are exposed daily to pathogenic microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria, which infect the oral cavity and respiratory tract. Dental procedures carry the risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to their specificity. Direct transmission regards the distance between operator and patient, exposure to saliva, blood and other body fluids, the use of sharp instruments and ""droplet-generating"" rotating instruments, contact with the conjunctival mucosa, and finally the contact with droplets produced by coughing and nasal secretion of an infected individual without mask at short distance, increasing the biological risk for the operator. In light of the pandemic linked to COVID-19, although there is no clear scientific evidence in the literature, it is necessary to identify protections with regard to clothing, operating protocols, disinfection of environments and management of waiting rooms and front offices. This paper is a basis for operative indications for dentists and other health care professionals in phase 2 post lockdown for both private and public structures."

7038,Antibody indexes in COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors: Unanswered questions.,"Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is characterized by high contagiousness, as well as variable clinical manifestations and immune responses. The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is directly related to viral clearance and the antibodies' ability to neutralize the virus and confer long-term immunity. Nevertheless, the response can also be associated with disease severity and evolution. This study correlated the clinical characteristics of convalescent COVID-19 patients with immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: This study included 51 COVID-19 health care professionals who were candidates for convalescent plasma donation from April to June 2020. The subjects had symptomatic COVID-19 with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies after symptom recovery, and the subjects were classified as having mild, moderate, or severe symptoms. Results: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positive in most patients (90.2%). The antibody indexes for IgA and IgG did not differ significantly between patients presenting with mild or moderate symptoms. However, they were significantly higher in patients with severe symptoms. Conclusions: Our study showed an association between higher antibody indexes and severe COVID-19 cases, and several hypotheses regarding the association of the antibody dynamics and severity of the disease in SARS-CoV-2 infection have been raised, although many questions remain unanswered."
7039,Pediatric COVID-19 and Pericarditis Presenting With Acute Pericardial Tamponade.,"We describe a seven-year-old female with acute pericarditis presenting with pericardial tamponade, who screened positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 [SARS-CoV-2]) in the setting of cough, chest pain, and orthopnea. She required emergent pericardiocentesis. Due to continued chest pain and orthopnea, rising inflammatory markers, and worsening pericardial inflammation, she underwent surgical pericardial decortication and pericardiectomy. Her symptoms and pericardial effusion resolved, and she was discharged to home 3 days later on ibuprofen and colchicine with instruction to quarantine at home for 14 days from the date of her positive testing for COVID-19."
