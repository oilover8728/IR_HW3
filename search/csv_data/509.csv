5080,Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Ultrasensitive Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Saliva and Viral Transport Medium Clinical Samples.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the shortcomings in the deployment of state-of-the-art diagnostics platforms. Although several polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques have been rapidly developed to meet the growing testing needs, such techniques often need samples collected through a swab, the use of RNA extraction kits, and expensive thermocyclers in order to successfully perform the test. Isothermal amplification-based approaches have also been recently demonstrated for rapid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection by minimizing sample preparation while also reducing the instrumentation and reaction complexity. In addition, there are limited reports of saliva as the sample source, and some of these indicate inferior sensitivity when comparing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with PCR-based techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate an improved sensitivity assay from saliva using a two-step RT-LAMP assay, where a short 10 min RT step is performed with only B3 and backward inner primers before the final reaction. We show that while the one-step RT-LAMP demonstrates satisfactory results, the optimized two-step approach allows detection of only few molecules per reaction and performs significantly better than the one-step RT-LAMP and conventional two-step RT-LAMP approaches with all primers included in the RT step. We show control measurements with RT-PCR, and importantly, we demonstrate RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP-based assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from viral transport media and saliva clinical samples."

5083,Evaluation of Diagnostic Performance of Chest CT with RT-PCR in Suspected Coronavirus Patients in Bangladesh.,"A cross sectional study was conducted to demonstrate the value of Computed Tomographic (CT) scan in clinically suspected 114 COVID-19 patients with emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings of chest CT. The CT findings were compared and correlated with the results of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction for corona virus disease. This study was conducted in the Department of Radiology and Imaging, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka with clinically COVID-19 suspected patients. This cross sectional study was performed from July 7 to August 7, 2020 where both chest HRCT and RT-PCR test were included, keeping RT-PCR as the reference standard. Of the 114 patients 104(91.22%) patients had ground glass opacities (with no consolidation), 50(43.85%) patients had ground glass opacity and consolidation. Along with ground glass opacities 60(52.63%) patients had associated crazy paving appearance, 44(39.59%) patients had reverse halo sign, 76(66.66%) patients had vascular thickening and 60(52.63%) patients had fibrotic shadows. Most patients (94%) (98/104) had bilateral chest CT findings. Out of 114 patients, 96 (84%) patients had positive RT-PCR results and 18(15.7%) patients had negative RT-PCR results. Out of 96 RT-PCR positive patients, 90 patients had positive chest CT findings, where was 06 patients had negative CT findings. On the other hand, out of 18 RT-PCR negative patients, 14 patients had positive chest CT findings while 4 patients had negative chest CT findings. To conclude, chest CT imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, Data and analysis from our study suggests that chest CT ought to be considered for the COVID-19 as a primary diagnostic tool for early detection of COVID-19 patients where awaited RT-PCR results."
5084,Fatal cerebral haemorrhage after COVID-19 vaccine.,"Background: New vaccines against COVID-19 are being rolled out globally. AstraZeneca's vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was not known to cause vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) at the time of this case. Case presentation: The patient was a previously healthy woman in her thirties with headaches that developed one week after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Three days later, her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she presented to the emergency department with slurred speech, uncoordinated movements and reduced consciousness. Symptoms progressed to left-sided hemiparesis and her level of consciousness deteriorated. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed a large right-sided haemorrhage and incipient herniation. She was found to have severe thrombocytopenia 37 x 109/l, (ref 145 - 390 x 109/l). In spite of efforts to reduce intracranial pressure, the patient died the following day. Post mortem examination revealed antibodies to PF4, and fresh small thrombi were found in the transverse sinus, frontal lobe and pulmonary artery. Interpretation: Severe thrombocytopenia and antibodies to PF4 make a diagnosis of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) likely."
5085,"Comparison of automated SARS-CoV-2 antigen test for COVID-19 infection with quantitative RT-PCR using 313 nasopharyngeal swabs, including from seven serially followed patients.","In routine clinical practice, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is determined by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). In the current pandemic, a more rapid and high-throughput method is in growing demand. Here, we validated the performance of a new antigen test (LUMIPULSE) based on chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. A total of 313 nasopharyngeal swabs (82 serial samples from 7 infected patients and 231 individual samples from 4 infected patients and 215 uninfected individuals) were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and then subjected to LUMIPULSE. We determined the cutoff value for antigen detection using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared the performance of the antigen test with that of RT-qPCR. We also compared the viral loads and antigen levels in serial samples from seven infected patients. Using RT-qPCR as the reference, the antigen test exhibited 55.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity, with a 91.4% overall agreement rate (286/313). In specimens with > 100 viral copies and between 10 and 100 copies, the antigen test showed 100% and 85% concordance with RT-qPCR, respectively. This concordance declined with lower viral loads. In the serially followed patients, the antigen levels showed a steady decline, along with viral clearance. This gradual decline was in contrast with the abrupt positive-to-negative and negative-to-positive status changes observed with RT-qPCR, particularly in the late phase of infection. In summary, the LUMIPULSE antigen test can rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with moderate to high viral loads and may be helpful for monitoring viral clearance in hospitalized patients."
5086,What Now? Health Challenges for 2021.,
5087,Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and has caused a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, named 'coronavirus disease 2019' (COVID-19), which threatens human health and public safety. In this Review, we describe the basic virology of SARS-CoV-2, including genomic characteristics and receptor use, highlighting its key difference from previously known coronaviruses. We summarize current knowledge of clinical, epidemiological and pathological features of COVID-19, as well as recent progress in animal models and antiviral treatment approaches for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss the potential wildlife hosts and zoonotic origin of this emerging virus in detail."
5088,The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis after vaccination against COVID-19: case report.,"Background: The Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis (SIADH) has been described to be associated with a multitude of conditions and medications, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We describe the case of a patient with newly diagnosed and symptomatic SIADH after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccination not explained otherwise. Case presentation: A 79-year-old male person was admitted to the emergency department due to a worsening of his general health state expressed by weakness, fatigue and anorexia. Vital signs and clinical findings were normal, in particular the patient was considered to be euvolemic. Laboratory investigations revealed a serum sodium of 117 mmol/L, a serum osmolality of 241 mosm/kg and a urea of 1.2 mmol/L with creatinine within normal range. Urine chemistry showed a urine osmolality of 412 mosm/kg and urine sodium of 110 mmol/L. TSH, C-reactive protein, and basal cortisol levels were normal. Under therapy with balanced crystalloid fluids, hyponatremia worsened and in absence of diuretic medications, diagnosis of SIADH was made. Since fluid restriction was not sufficiently effective, oral urea was administered. Under this therapy regimen hyponatremia resolved. Conclusions: Local as well as systemic reactions have been described for the new mRNA-based vaccines including pain and fever. Therefore, it is imaginable that the vaccine might trigger SIADH in some patients."
5089,Sudden bilateral vision loss in a COVID-19 patient: A case report.,"We present a Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient who developed sudden bilateral vision loss after a bilateral occipital ischemic stroke and without a history of stroke risk factors. An 84-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with bilateral sudden vision loss while receiving Favipiravir treatment for 5 days following a COVID-19 diagnosis. The patient had no history of stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or arrhythmia. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of the patient revealed acute ischemia in the bilateral posterior occipital lobe and bilateral cerebellar hemisphere. We conclude that COVID-19 may rarely cause bilateral ischemic stroke presented only in the form of vision loss."
