3511,Absence of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients with end-stage renal disease following facility-wide testing in four outpatient hemodialysis facilities.,Facility-wide testing performed at 4 outpatient hemodialysis facilities in the absence of an outbreak or escalating community incidence did not identify new SARS-CoV-2 infections and illustrated key logistical considerations essential to successful implementation of SARS-CoV-2 screening. Facilities could consider prioritizing facility-wide SARS-CoV-2 testing during suspicion of an outbreak in the facility or escalating community spread without robust infection control strategies in place. Being prepared to address operational considerations will enhance implementation of facility-wide testing in the outpatient dialysis setting.
3512,"Process development and scale-up optimization of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain-based vaccine candidate, RBD219-N1C1.","A SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-N1C1 (RBD219-N1C1) recombinant protein antigen formulated on Alhydrogel® has recently been shown to elicit a robust neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in mice. The antigen has been produced under current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) and is now in clinical testing. Here, we report on process development and scale-up optimization for upstream fermentation and downstream purification of the antigen. This includes production at the 1-L and 5-L scales in the yeast, Pichia pastoris, and the comparison of three different chromatographic purification methods. This culminated in the selection of a process to produce RBD219-N1C1 with a yield of >400 mg per liter of fermentation with >92% purity and >39% target product recovery after purification. In addition, we show the results from analytical studies, including SEC-HPLC, DLS, and an ACE2 receptor binding assay that were performed to characterize the purified proteins to select the best purification process. Finally, we propose an optimized upstream fermentation and downstream purification process that generates quality RBD219-N1C1 protein antigen and is fully scalable at a low cost. KEY POINTS: • Yeast fermentation conditions for a recombinant COVID-19 vaccine were determined. • Three purification protocols for a COVID-19 vaccine antigen were compared. • Reproducibility of a scalable, low-cost process for a COVID-19 vaccine was shown.

3514,Immune transcriptomes of highly exposed SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic seropositive versus seronegative individuals from the Ischgl community.,"SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic to severe with lingering symptomatology in some. This prompted investigation of whether or not asymptomatic disease results in measurable immune activation post-infection. Immune activation following asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was characterized through a comparative investigation of the immune cell transcriptomes from 43 asymptomatic seropositive and 52 highly exposed seronegative individuals from the same community 4-6 weeks following a superspreading event. Few of the 95 individuals had underlying health issues. One seropositive individual reported Cystic Fibrosis and one individual reported Incontinentia pigmenti. No evidence of immune activation was found in asymptomatic seropositive individuals with the exception of the Cystic Fibrosis patient. There were no statistically significant differences in immune transcriptomes between asymptomatic seropositive and highly exposed seronegative individuals. Four positive controls, mildly symptomatic seropositive individuals whose blood was examined 3 weeks following infection, showed immune activation. Negative controls were four seronegative individuals from neighboring communities without COVID-19. All individuals remained in their usual state of health through a five-month follow-up after sample collection. In summary, whole blood transcriptomes identified individual immune profiles within a community population and showed that asymptomatic infection within a super-spreading event was not associated with enduring immunological activation."
3515,The politics of Covid-19 vaccine confidence.,"In the context of emerging COVID-19 virus variants, trends of vaccine nationalism, and multiple vaccine supply challenges, COVID-19 vaccine related uncertainties and challenges continue. Additionally, confidence in new COVID-19 vaccines is highly variable, with minority communities generally less trusting of not only the new vaccines, but also those who produce them and the governments buying and recommending them. How governments handle the COVID-19 response will be a key influencer of public confidence in and acceptance of COVID vaccination."
3516,Promise and challenges in the development of COVID-19 vaccines.,"The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19, caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, created an unprecedented challenge to global public health system and biomedical community. Vaccination is an effective way to prevent viral infection, stop its transmission, and develop herd immunity. Rapid progress and advances have been made to date in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Currently, more than 115 vaccine candidates have been developed from different technology platforms with several of them in clinical trials. Most of those vaccine candidates are developed based on the experience with other coronaviruses with an aim to induce neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein or its different receptor binding domains. Here, we discuss the promise, potential scientific challenges, and future directions for the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. We also emphasize the importance of a better understanding of the infection pathogenesis and host defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 infection."

3519,Disposable photonics for cost-effective clinical bioassays: application to COVID-19 antibody testing.,"Decades of research have shown that biosensors using photonic circuits fabricated using CMOS processes can be highly sensitive, selective, and quantitative. Unfortunately, the cost of these sensors combined with the complexity of sample handling systems has limited the use of such sensors in clinical diagnostics. We present a new ""disposable photonics"" sensor platform in which rice-sized (1 × 4 mm) silicon nitride ring resonator sensor chips are paired with plastic micropillar fluidic cards for sample handling and optical detection. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in the context of detecting human antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, both in convalescent COVID-19 patients and for subjects undergoing vaccination. Given its ability to provide quantitative data on human samples in a simple, low-cost single-use format, we anticipate that this platform will find broad utility in clinical diagnostics for a broad range of assays."
