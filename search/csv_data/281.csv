2800,"COVID-19 vaccine trials: The potential for ""hybrid"" analyses.","Background: Although several COVID-19 vaccines have been found to be effective in rigorous evaluation and have emerging availability in parts of the world, their supply will be inadequate to meet international needs for a considerable period of time. There also will be continued interest in vaccines that are more effective or have improved scalability to facilitate mass vaccination campaigns. Ongoing clinical testing of new vaccines also will be needed as variant strains continue to emerge that may elude some aspects of immunity induced by current vaccines. Randomized clinical trials meaningfully enhance the efficiency and reliability of such clinical testing. In clinical settings with limited or no access to known effective vaccines, placebo-controlled randomized trials of new vaccines remain a preferred approach to maximize the reliability, efficiency and interpretability of results. When emerging availability of licensed vaccines makes it no longer possible to use a placebo control, randomized active comparator non-inferiority trials may enable reliable insights. Methods: In this article, ""hybrid"" methods are proposed to address settings where, during the conduct of a placebo-controlled trial, a judgment is made to replace the placebo arm by a licensed COVID-19 vaccine due to emerging availability of effective vaccines in regions participating in that trial. These hybrid methods are based on proposed statistics that aggregate evidence to formally test as well as to estimate the efficacy of the experimental vaccine, by combining placebo-controlled data during the first period of trial conduct with active-controlled data during the second period. Results: Application of the proposed methods is illustrated in two important scenarios where the active control vaccine would become available in regions engaging in the experimental vaccine's placebo-controlled trial: in the first, the active comparator's vaccine efficacy would have been established to be 50%-70% for the 4- to 6-month duration of follow-up of its placebo-controlled trial; in the second, the active comparator's vaccine efficacy would have been established to be 90%-95% during that duration. These two scenarios approximate what has been seen with adenovirus vaccines or mRNA vaccines, respectively, assuming the early estimates of vaccine efficacy for those vaccines would hold over longer-term follow-up. Conclusion: The proposed hybrid methods could readily play an important role in the near future in the design, conduct and analysis of randomized clinical trials performed to address the need for multiple additional vaccines reliably established to be safe and have worthwhile efficacy in reducing the risk of symptomatic disease from SARS-CoV-2 infections."
2801,COVID-19 in adults: test menu for hospital blood science laboratories.,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a respiratory illness caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Clinical Blood Sciences Laboratory (CBSL) plays a key role in supporting the monitoring and management of patients with COVID-19 disease. Objective: To provide a comprehensive CBSL testing protocol to support the medical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Description of the biochemical, haematological and immunological tests that have a role in the assessment and monitoring of patients with COVID-19 infection. Results: We provide a test menu for clinical laboratories to ensure the effective monitoring, management and prognostication of COVID-19 patients in hospital. Conclusion: Given the rapidity with which patients with COVID-19 disease can deteriorate, we recommend regular testing with vigilance paid to the rate and trajectory of change in each of these parameters."
2802,"SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) vaccines structure, mechanisms and effectiveness: A review.","The world has been suffering from COVID-19 disease for more than a year, and it still has a high mortality rate. In addition to the need to minimize transmission of the virus through non-pharmacological measures such as the use of masks and social distance, many efforts are being made to develop a variety of vaccines to prevent the disease worldwide. So far, several vaccines have reached the final stages of safety and efficacy in various phases of clinical trials, and some, such as Moderna/NIAID and BioNTech/Pfizer, have reported very high safety and protection. The important point is that comparing different vaccines is not easy because there is no set standard for measuring neutralization. In this study, we have reviewed the common platforms of COVID-19 vaccines and tried to present the latest reports on the effectiveness of these vaccines."

Two doses of vaccine were highly effective against hospitalisation, but suboptimal for infection control."
2806,"Preparing for the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Vaccination: Evidence, Plans, and Implications.","The formation of herd immunity through vaccination is a key point in overcoming the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To acquire herd immunity, a high vaccination rate is required, which is necessary to instill confidence in the public regarding the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. In the real-world setting, thorough preparation of components, such as priority setting, vaccine delivery, logistics, and side-effect monitoring is necessary to overcome vaccine hesitancy. Each country prioritizes vaccination since healthcare workers, nursing facility residents, and the elderly population, and similar trends are found between countries. Vaccination is performed at large centers and medical institutions operated by the country, and variations are dependent on the environment of each country. The transport of mRNA vaccines is a challenging task, and to this end, each government is striving for safe distribution. In addition, each authority operates a surveillance system to monitor the safety of vaccines, and Korea needs to produce evidence for monitoring effects and side effects with expertise. Even after the acquisition of herd immunity, COVID-19 is highly likely to remain an endemic infectious disease, and a higher immunity level may be required because of variants of the virus. If the spread of variants of concern continues, a booster vaccination may be required. Therefore, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, wearing a mask, and epidemiological investigation should be maintained."
2807,COVID-19: breaking down a global health crisis.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the second pandemic of the twenty-first century, with over one-hundred million infections and over two million deaths to date. It is a novel strain from the Coronaviridae family, named Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); the 7th known member of the coronavirus family to cause disease in humans, notably following the Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS). The most characteristic feature of this single-stranded RNA molecule includes the spike glycoprotein on its surface. Most patients with COVID-19, of which the elderly and immunocompromised are most at risk, complain of flu-like symptoms, including dry cough and headache. The most common complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and cardiovascular manifestations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via respiratory droplets, either directly from the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, or in the form of fomites on surfaces. Maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and personal protective equipment (i.e., masks) remain the most effective precautions. Patient management includes supportive care and anticoagulative measures, with a focus on maintaining respiratory function. Therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab appear to be most promising to date, with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferons falling out of favour. Additionally, accelerated vaccination efforts have taken place internationally, with several promising vaccinations being mass deployed. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries and stakeholders have taken varying precautions to combat and contain the spread of the virus and dampen its collateral economic damage. This review paper aims to synthesize the impact of the virus on a global, micro to macro scale."
