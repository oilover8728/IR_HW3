6600,Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 reduces neutralisation activity of antibodies against wild-type SARS-CoV-2.,"Spike-specific antibodies contribute significantly to the neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2 and are important for the therapeutic effect of convalescent plasma. B.1.1.7 is a recently emerged variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has several mutations in the gene encoding for the spike-protein. To assess the potential effect these mutations could have on the neutralising efficacy of antibodies, we evaluated 96 serum samples from convalescent plasma donors collected before the first occurrence of B.1.1.7 and tested their neutralising effect on wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7. We found that B.1.1.7 is more resistant to neutralisation by convalescent plasma from patients infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with an overall decrease in neutralising activity of 47.7%. Thus, the neutralising effect of convalescent plasma should be determined against the major circulating virus clades whenever possible to ensure the best possible therapeutic effect."
6601,A faster and less costly alternative for RNA extraction of SARS-CoV-2 using proteinase k treatment followed by thermal shock.,"One of the biggest challenges during the pandemic has been obtaining and maintaining critical material to conduct the increasing demand for molecular tests. Sometimes, the lack of suppliers and the global shortage of these reagents, a consequence of the high demand, make it difficult to detect and diagnose patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, negatively impacting the control of virus spread. Many alternatives have enabled the continuous processing of samples and have presented a decrease in time and cost. These measures thus allow broad testing of the population and should be ideal for controlling the disease. In this sense, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection effectiveness by Real time RT-PCR using two different protocols for RNA extraction. The experiments were conducted in the National Institute of Health (INS) from Peru. We compared Ct values average (experimental triplicate) results from two different targets, a viral and internal control. All samples were extracted in parallel using a commercial kit and our alternative protocol-samples submitted to proteinase K treatment (3 μg/μL, 56°C for 10 minutes) followed by thermal shock (98°C for 5 minutes followed by 4°C for 2 minutes); the agreement between results was 100% in the samples tested. In addition, we compared the COVID-19 positivity between six epidemiological weeks: the initial two in that the Real time RT-PCR reactions were conducted using RNA extracted by commercial kit, followed by two other using RNA obtained by our kit-free method, and the last two using kit once again; they did not differ significantly. We concluded that our in-house method is an easy, fast, and cost-effective alternative method for extracting RNA and conducing molecular diagnosis of COVID-19."
6602,Chest CT for triage during COVID-19 on the emergency department: myth or truth?,"Purpose: We aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of chest CT compared with first RT-PCR results in adult patients suspected of COVID-19 infection in an ED setting. We also constructed a predictive machine learning model based on chest CT and additional data to improve the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT. Methods: This study's cohort consisted of 319 patients who underwent chest CT and RT-PCR testing at the ED. Patient characteristics, demographics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory tests, and chest CT results (CO-RADS) were collected. With first RT-PCR as reference standard, the diagnostic performance of chest CT using the CO-RADS score was assessed. Additionally, a predictive machine learning model was constructed using logistic regression. Results: Chest CT, with first RT-PCR as a reference, had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 90.2%, 88.2%, 84.5%, and 92.7%, respectively. The prediction model with CO-RADS, ferritin, leucocyte count, CK, days of complaints, and diarrhea as predictors had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 89.3%, 93.4%, 90.8%, and 92.3%, respectively. Conclusion: Chest CT, using the CO-RADS scoring system, is a sensitive and specific method that can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially if RT-PCR tests are scarce during an outbreak. Combining a predictive machine learning model could further improve the accuracy of diagnostic chest CT for COVID-19. Further candidate predictors should be analyzed to improve our model. However, RT-PCR should remain the primary standard of testing as up to 9% of RT-PCR positive patients are not diagnosed by chest CT or our machine learning model."
6603,"Routine testing of close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases - National COVID-19 Contact Management Programme, Ireland, May to August 2020.","Objectives: The objective of this study was to inform public health practitioners who are designing, adapting and implementing testing and tracing strategies for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) control. Study design: The study design is monitoring and evaluation of a national public health protection programme. Methods: All close contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified between the 19th May and 2nd August were included; secondary attack rates and numbers needed to test were estimated. Results: Four thousand five hundred eighty six of 7272 (63%) close contacts of cases were tested with at least one test. The secondary attack rate in close contacts who were tested was 7% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 6.3 - 7.8%). At the 'day 0' test, 14.6% (95% CI: 11.6-17.6%) of symptomatic close contacts tested positive compared with 5.2% (95% CI: 4.4-5.9%) of asymptomatic close contacts. Conclusions: The application of additional symptom-based criteria for testing in this high-incidence population (close contacts) is of limited utility because of the low negative predictive value of absence of symptoms."
6604,"The impact of COVID-19 on adjusted mortality risk in care homes for older adults in Wales, UK: a retrospective population-based cohort study for mortality in 2016-2020.","Background: mortality in care homes has had a prominent focus during the COVID-19 outbreak. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to the spread of infectious diseases, which may lead to increased mortality risk. Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. Aim: to analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4 years. Study design and setting: we used anonymised electronic health records and administrative data from the secure anonymised information linkage databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. Methods: we calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted HRs for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. Results: survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1.72 (1.55, 1.90) compared with 2016. Compared with the general population in 2016-2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2.15 (2.11, 2.20) in 2016-2019 to 2.94 (2.81, 3.08) in 2020. Conclusions: the survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of death in the 2020 study periods."

6606,Drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system and SARS-CoV-2.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the ongoing global Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, resulting in thousands of deaths worldwide and representing a health challenge with few precedents in human history. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) facilitates the access of SARS-CoV-2 to cells. Therapeutic agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) might be able to modulate the concentration of ACE-2 and the various components of the system. Here, we discuss current pharmacological, molecular, and clinical evidence to investigate whether drugs acting on RAS with modulation of the ACE-2 concentration have added value in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also highlight the possible deleterious action of the ACE/Ang-II/AT-1r axis and possible beneficial role of the ACE-2/Ang 1-7/MasR axis in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by SARS-CoV-2, discussing the possibility of addressing the various RAS components with drug treatments to improve clinical outcomes."
6607,Coronavax: preparing community and government for COVID-19 vaccination: a research protocol for a mixed methods social research project.,"Introduction: Ahead of the implementation of a COVID-19 vaccination programme, the interdisciplinary Coronavax research team developed a multicomponent mixed methods project to support successful roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine in Western Australia. This project seeks to analyse community attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination, vaccine access and information needs. We also study how government incorporates research findings into the vaccination programme. Methods and analysis: The Coronavax protocol employs an analytical social media study, and a qualitative study using in-depth interviews with purposively selected community groups. Participant groups currently include healthcare workers, aged care workers, first responders, adults aged 65+ years, adults aged 30-64 years, young adults aged 18-29 years, education workers, parents/guardians of infants and young children (<5 years), parents/guardians of children aged 5-18 years with comorbidities and parents/guardians who are hesitant about routine childhood vaccines. The project also includes two studies that track how Australian state and Commonwealth (federal) governments use the study findings. These are functional dialogues (translation and discussion exercises that are recorded and analysed) and evidence mapping of networks within government (which track how study findings are used). Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval has been granted by the Child and Adolescent Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) and the University of Western Australia HREC. Study findings will be disseminated by a series of journal articles, reports to funders and stakeholders, and invited and peer-reviewed presentations."
6608,"The immunology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the potential antibody based treatments and vaccination strategies.","Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a potentially fatal agent for a new emerging viral disease (COVID-19) is of great global public health emergency. Herein, we represented potential antibody-based treatments especially monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that may exert a potential role in treatment as well as developing vaccination strategies against COVID-19.Areas covered: We used PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov search strategies for relevant papers. We demonstrated some agents with potentially favorable efficacy as well as favorable safety. Several therapies are under assessment to evaluate their efficacy and safety for COVID19. However, the development of different strategies such as SARS-CoV-2-based vaccines and antibody therapy are urgently required beside other effective therapies such as plasma, anticoagulants, and immune as well as antiviral therapies. We encourage giving more attention to antibody-based treatments as an immediate strategy. Although there has not been any approved specific vaccine until now, developing vaccination strategies may have a protective effect against COVID-19.Expert opinion: An antiviral mAbs could be a safe and high-quality therapeutic intervention which is greatly recommended for COVID-19. Additionally, the high sequence homology between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS/MERS viruses could shed light on developing to design a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2."
6609,Potential immune response to breast implants after immunization with COVID-19 vaccines.,Besides reports of alarming potential side effects after COVID-19 vaccinations there have been rare observations of rather benign reactions to foreign materials such as cosmetic hyaluronic acid filler injections after a COVID-19 immunization. Likewise to dermal fillers any foreign material may cause a reaction when the immune system is triggered. In the recent weeks we observed four noteworthy potential reactions in association with breast implants between one and three days after COVID-19 vaccinations. We release these information at the earliest to educate colleagues and draw attention to possible reactions between the COVID-19 vaccines and foreign bodies such as breast implants.
