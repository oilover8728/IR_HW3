9290,Corona viruses: reaching far beyond the common cold.,"Background: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are one of the most common causes of the ""common cold"". Some HCoV strains, however, can cause fatal respiratory disease. Some examples of these diseases are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). This article will review the etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using the terms ""human coronaviruses"", ""MERS-CoV"", ""SARSCoV"", ""SARS-CoV2"", ""COVID-19"", and ""common cold"" in OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. Findings: Most HCoVs cause mild upper respiratory infections which resolve with supportive care and no sequelae. In recent decades, however, there have been outbreaks of novel HCoVs that cause more severe disease. This is largely due to HCoVs having large genomes which undergo frequent recombination events, leading to the emergence of novel and more virulent strains of the virus. These severe respiratory illnesses can lead to acute respiratory distress requiring invasive intervention, such as mechanical ventilation. These severe infections can lead to long-lasting sequelae in patients. Scientists continue to investigate potential treatments for these viruses, though supportive care remains the gold standard. Scientists have succeeded in developing numerous vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and ongoing data collection and analysis will shed even more light on the next steps in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Due to the frequency of recombination events and the subsequent emergence of novel strains, HCoVs are becoming more prevalent, making them a global health concern as they can lead to epidemics and pandemics. Understanding the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs is important, especially during this worldwide pandemic."
9291,Insights on cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from structural modeling.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic that has infected more than 31 million people in more than 180 countries worldwide. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans from wild animals. Given the scale and widespread geographical distribution of the current pandemic and confirmed cases of cross-species transmission, the question of the extent to which this transmission is possible emerges, as well as what molecular features distinguish susceptible from non-susceptible animal species. Here, we investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also allow us to predict affinity-enhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2 variants for therapeutic purposes. Finally, our study provides a blueprint for modeling viral-host protein interactions and highlights several important considerations when designing these computational studies and analyzing their results."
9292,Trigeminal neuralgia as the sole neurological manifestation of COVID-19: A case report.,"Objective: To describe a case report of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Background: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Respiratory system manifestations are dominant in this new disease. However, numerous case series and reviews have been published on the neurological manifestations, highlighting the potential neurotropism of the new coronavirus. Methods: We describe a clinical case of TN during COVID-19 and we discuss the differential diagnosis and the potential pathogenic mechanism according to the literature. Results: A 65-year-old man with general malaise and typical respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, who presented with paroxysmal lancinating pain in the right V1 trigeminal territory without other neurological symptoms. General blood test and neuroimaging study were normal. A rapid test showed positive IgG and IgM serologies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patient was diagnosed with TN secondary to a viral infection by SARS-CoV-2. Facial pain resolved with the improvement of COVID-19. Conclusions: The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a possible etiology of secondary TN. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to elucidate the neuropathology of this viral infection."
9293,"Multiple Transmission Chains within COVID-19 Cluster, Connecticut, USA, 2020(1).","In fall 2020, a coronavirus disease cluster comprising 16 cases occurred in Connecticut, USA. Epidemiologic and genomic evidence supported transmission among persons at a school and fitness center but not a workplace. The multiple transmission chains identified within this cluster highlight the necessity of a combined investigatory approach."
9294,"Comparison and correlation of commercial SARS-CoV-2 real-time-PCR assays, Ireland, June 2020.","We report the performance of a variety of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 PCR kits, used in several different sites across Ireland to determine if Ct values across platforms are comparable. We also investigate whether a Ct value, a surrogate for calculated viral loads in the absence of viral culture of > 34 can be used to exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications. We found a variation in Ct values from different assays for the same calculated viral load; this should be taken into consideration for result interpretation."
9295,[Treatment of COVID-19 guided by holistic view of traditional Chinese medicine--therapy aimed at both viral and host].,"The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has further spread, and there is an increasing number of confirmed cases in many countries. On February 28, 2020 of Geneva time, the World Health Organization has raised global risk level to the very high level in view of outbreak of COVID-19. Since some patients' condition appeared to deteriorate rapidly after infection of this 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV), a variety of treatments should be considered. Holistic view and syndrome differentiation are the two characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). Therefore, under the guidance of the holistic view, syndrome diffe-rentiation of TCM has achieved good effects in the treatment of COVID-19. This treatment mainly aimed at eliminating pathogens and strengthening overall health, regulating the balance of body and coordinating various of functions of Zangfu organs. In addition, modern medical proposes host-directed therapy(HDT), a strategy aims to interfere with host cell mechanism, enhance immune responses, and reduce exacerbated inflammation. To some extent, the combined application of HDT and antiviral therapy is highly consistent with the therapeutic concept of the holistic view of TCM. Therefore, under the guidance of the holistic view, syndrome differentiation of TCM uses treatments, such as clearing heat, detoxification, relieving asthma, clearing damp and phlegm, together with Lianhua Qingwen Capsules, Maxing Shigan Decoction, and Haoqin Qingdan Decoction under the guidance of these therapeutic methods. These therapeutic methods and prescriptions intervened with both virus and host at the same time in the treatment of COVID-19, which has important implications for the effective clinical treatment of COVID-19."

9297,"Prevention of COVID-19 in Internally Displaced Persons Camps in War-Torn North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo: A Mixed-Methods Study.","Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a grave threat to refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). We examined knowledge, attitudes, and practices with respect to COVID-19 prevention among IDPs in war-torn Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Methods: Mixed-methods study with qualitative (focus group discussions, [FGDs]) and quantitative (52-item survey questionnaire) data collection and synthesis. Results: FGDs (N=23) and survey questionnaires (N=164 IDPs; N=143 comparison group) were conducted in May 2020. FGD participants provided narratives of violence that they had fled. IDPs were statistically more likely to have larger household size, experience more extreme poverty, have lower educational attainment, and have less access to information through media and internet versus the comparison group (P<.05 for the comparison group). IDPs had a high level of awareness (99%) and fear (98%) of COVID-19, but lower specific knowledge (15% sufficient knowledge versus 30% among the comparison group, P<.0001), a difference which remained significant in a multivariable model adjusting for confounding. IDPs faced major barriers to implementing COVID-19 prevention measures. Physical distancing was impossible for IDPs in crowded shelters, and 70% reported coming in close contact with someone other than a family member within the past 24 hours (versus 56% of the comparison group, P=.014). Frequent movements in and out of the camp for subsistence left IDPs vulnerable to the introduction of COVID-19: 61% left the camp on a daily basis and 65% had received a visitor in the past month. Despite acceptance of hand hygiene for prevention, 92% lacked soap (versus 65% of the comparison group, P<.0001). IDPs' desire for peace and to return to their native homes, where COVID-19 precautions could be feasibly implemented, overshadowed their perceived benefits of measures such as a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: These findings provide empiric evidence supporting the vulnerability of IDPs to COVID-19 and call for action to protect neglected displaced populations."
9298,An artificial intelligence approach to COVID-19 infection risk assessment in virtual visits: A case report.,"Objective: In an effort to improve the efficiency of computer algorithms applied to screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing, we used natural language processing and artificial intelligence-based methods with unstructured patient data collected through telehealth visits. Materials and methods: After segmenting and parsing documents, we conducted analysis of overrepresented words in patient symptoms. We then developed a word embedding-based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients' self-reported symptoms. Results: Text analytics revealed that concepts such as smell and taste were more prevalent than expected in patients testing positive. As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms. The deep learning model yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.729 for predicting positive results and was subsequently applied to prioritize testing appointment scheduling. Conclusions: Informatics tools such as natural language processing and artificial intelligence methods can have significant clinical impacts when applied to data streams early in the development of clinical systems for outbreak response."
9299,Work Based Assessments (WBAs) amongst UK medical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic: How have we adapted?,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was recently identified as the RNA virus resulting in the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This was following cases of pneumonia identified in Hubei Province in China. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in medical, financial and social disruption on an international scale. Such disruption has additionally impacted postgraduate medical training. This has been reflected in the attainment of Work Based Assessments amongst medical trainees in the United Kingdom."
