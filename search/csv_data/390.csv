3893,Helping patients with ethical concerns about COVID-19 vaccines in light of fetal cell lines used in some COVID-19 vaccines.,"Many persons with religious convictions report hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines, in part due to ethical concerns that fetal cell lines are used in the development of certain vaccines. The issue of abortion is contentious and, given the potential impact on COVID-19 vaccination, it is important for clinicians to be aware of this issue, whatever their personal beliefs. I provide four responses that clinicians may offer their patients: 1) Ethical analyses of moral complicity and COVID vaccines. 2) Altruism and protecting others from a virus that is often transmitted while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. 3) Religious texts and many religious leaders support prevention and, therefore, vaccination. 4) Administration of vaccines not developed in fetal cell lines. Although I wish for all my patients to be vaccinated, I respect their autonomy to make the choice to be or not to be vaccinated and understand that many have a deep regard for fetal life."
3894,[Immunity against SARS-CoV-2: walking to the vaccination].,"The coronavirus are a wide group of viruses among that the SARS-CoV-2 is included (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Betacoronavirus and subgenus Sarbecovirus). Its main structural proteins are the membrane (M), the envelope (E), the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves the cellular and the humoral sides, with neutralizing antibodies fundamentally directed against the S antigen. Although the seroprevalence data are frequently assumed as protection markers, no necessarily they are. In Spain, it is estimated that, to assure the herd immunity, at least four-fifths of the population should be immunoprotected. Due the high fatality rate of COVID-19, the acquisition of the protection only by the natural infection it not assumable and other measures as the mass immunization are required. Currently, there are several vaccine prototypes (including life virus, viral vectors, peptides and proteins and nucleic acid) in different phase of clinical evaluation. Foreseeably, some of these news vaccines would be soon commercially available. In this text, aspects related to these issues are reviewed."
3895,Label-Free Segmentation of COVID-19 Lesions in Lung CT.,"Scarcity of annotated images hampers the building of automated solution for reliable COVID-19 diagnosis and evaluation from CT. To alleviate the burden of data annotation, we herein present a label-free approach for segmenting COVID-19 lesions in CT via voxel-level anomaly modeling that mines out the relevant knowledge from normal CT lung scans. Our modeling is inspired by the observation that the parts of tracheae and vessels, which lay in the high-intensity range where lesions belong to, exhibit strong patterns. To facilitate the learning of such patterns at a voxel level, we synthesize 'lesions' using a set of simple operations and insert the synthesized 'lesions' into normal CT lung scans to form training pairs, from which we learn a normalcy-recognizing network (NormNet) that recognizes normal tissues and separate them from possible COVID-19 lesions. Our experiments on three different public datasets validate the effectiveness of NormNet, which conspicuously outperforms a variety of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods."
3896,The COVID-19 vaccine development: A pandemic paradigm.,"COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths and a social-economic crisis. A worldwide effort was made to develop efficient vaccines for this disease. A vaccine should produce immune responses with specific and neutralizing antibodies, and without harmful effects such as the antibody-dependent enhancement that may be associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Vaccine design involves the selection of platforms that includes viral, viral-vector, protein, nucleic acid, or trained immunity-based strategies. Its development initiates at a pre-clinical stage, followed by clinical trials when successful. Only if clinical trials show no significant evidence of safety concerns, vaccines can be manufactured, stored, and distributed to immunize the population. So far, regulatory authorities from many countries have approved nine vaccines with phase 3 results. In the current pandemic, a paradigm for the COVID-19 vaccine development has arisen, as many challenges must be overcome. Mass-production and cold-chain storage to immunize large human populations should be feasible and fast, and a combination of different vaccines may boost logistics and immunization. In silico trials is an emerging and innovative field that can be applied to predict and simulate immune, molecular, clinical, and epidemiological outcomes of vaccines to refine, reduce, and partially replace steps in vaccine development. Vaccine-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2 might emerge, leading to the necessity of updates. A globally fair vaccine distribution system must prevail over vaccine nationalism for the world to return to its pre-pandemic status."

3898,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and associated factors in Manaus, Brazil: baseline results from the DETECTCoV-19 cohort study.","Background: Manaus, located in the Brazilian rainforest, has experienced two health system collapses due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, little is known about which groups among the general population have been most affected. Methods: A convenience sampling strategy via online advertising recruited 3046 adults between 19 August 2020 and 2 October 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19-related symptoms, COVID-19 testing, self-medication and prescribed medications were recorded. Serum anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid immunoglobulin G antibodies were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using cluster-corrected and adjusted Poisson's regression models. Results: A crude positivity rate among asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals was estimated at 29.10%, with maximum possible seroprevalence of 44.82% corrected by test characteristics and an antibody decay rate of 32.31%. Regression models demonstrated a strong association towards marginalized low-income and vulnerable residents with limited access to health care. The presence of a COVID-19 case [PR 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-1.57] or death (PR 2.14, 95% CI 1.74-2.62) in a household greatly increased the risk of other household members acquiring infection. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher among those who self-medicated to prevent infection (PR 1.36, 95% CI 1.27-1.46). Conclusions: Disproportionate socio-economic disparity was observed among the study participants. The syndemic nature of COVID-19 in the Amazon region needs differential policies and urgent solutions to control the ongoing pandemic."
3899,Increasing the Efficiency of a National Laboratory Response to COVID-19: a Nationwide Multicenter Evaluation of 47 Commercial SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassays by 41 Laboratories.,"In response to the worldwide pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the subsequent antibody tests that flooded the market, a nationwide collaborative approach in the Netherlands was employed. Forty-one Dutch laboratories joined forces and shared their evaluation data to allow for the evaluation of a quantity of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 that exceeds the capacity of each individual laboratory. As of April 2020, these performance data had been aggregated and shared in regularly updated reports with other laboratories, Dutch government, public health organizations, and the public. This frequently updated overview of assay performance increased the efficiency of our national laboratory response, supporting laboratories in their choice and implementation of assays. Aggregated performance data for 47 immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 showed that none of the evaluated immunoassays that detect only IgM or IgA met the diagnostic criteria, indicating that they are not suitable for diagnosing acute infections. For the detection of IgG, only the Biozek Corona virus COVID rapid test, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and Wantai SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab) ELISA met predefined performance criteria in hospitalized patients where samples were collected 14 days post-onset of symptoms (DPO), while for patients with mild or asymptomatic infections, only the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA met the predefined performance criteria if samples were collected 14 days postonset. Here, we describe this unique nationwide collaboration during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; the collected data and their results are an example of what can be accomplished when forces are joined during a public health crisis."
