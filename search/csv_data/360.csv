3591,The Global Interest in Vaccines and Its Prediction and Perspectives in the Era of COVID-19. Real-Time Surveillance Using Google Trends.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has globally overwhelmed all sectors of life. The fast development of vaccines against COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the course of the pandemic. Methods: Global data from Google Trends was analyzed for vaccines against flu, BCG, HPV, pneumococcal disease, polio, and COVID-19. The time frame includes the last five-year period starting from 17 April 2016. Multiple training of time series models with back testing, including Holt-Winters forecasting, Exponential Smoothing State Space, Linear model with trend and seasonal components (tlsm), and ARIMA was conducted. Forecasting according to the best fitting model was performed. Results: Correlation analysis did not reveal a decrease in interest in vaccines during the analyzed period. The prediction models provided a short-term forecast of the dynamics of interest for flu, HPV, pneumococcal and polio vaccines with 5-10% growth in interest for the first quarter of 2022 when compared to the same quarter of 2021. Conclusions: Despite the huge interest in the COVID-19 vaccine, there has not been a detectable decline in the overall interest in the five analyzed vaccines."

3593,Immunocompromised Seroprevalence and Course of Illness of SARS-CoV-2 in One Pediatric Quaternary Care Center.,"Background: The burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is poorly understood in pediatric patients due to frequent asymptomatic and mild presentations. Additionally, the disease prevalence in pediatric immunocompromised patients remains unknown. Methods: This cross-sectional study tested convenience samples from pediatric patients who had clinically indicated lab work collected and an immunocompromising condition, including oncologic diagnoses, solid organ transplant (SOT), bone marrow transplant, primary immunodeficiency, and rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease on systemic immunosuppression, for the presence of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results: We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.0% (Confidence Interval [CI] 95%: 0.3%-2.4%). Two patients were positive by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but only 1 seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or SOT were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting with respiratory illness as compared with other groups. Conclusions: Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised children was similar to that of an immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6%, CI 95%: 0.3%-1.1%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However, none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and 2 patients did not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children, in contrast to immunocompromised adults."
3594,Metatranscriptomic Characterization of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Identified a Host Transcriptional Classifier Associated With Immune Signaling.,"Background: The recent identification of a novel coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has caused a global outbreak of respiratory illnesses. The rapidly developing pandemic has posed great challenges to diagnosis of this novel infection. However, little is known about the metatranscriptomic characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: We analyzed metatranscriptomics in 187 patients (62 cases with COVID-19 and 125 with non-COVID-19 pneumonia). Transcriptional aspects of 3 core elements, pathogens, the microbiome, and host responses, were evaluated. Based on the host transcriptional signature, we built a host gene classifier and examined its potential for diagnosing COVID-19 and indicating disease severity. Results: The airway microbiome in COVID-19 patients had reduced alpha diversity, with 18 taxa of differential abundance. Potentially pathogenic microbes were also detected in 47% of the COVID-19 cases, 58% of which were respiratory viruses. Host gene analysis revealed a transcriptional signature of 36 differentially expressed genes significantly associated with immune pathways, such as cytokine signaling. The host gene classifier built on such a signature exhibited the potential for diagnosing COVID-19 (area under the curve of 0.75-0.89) and indicating disease severity. Conclusions: Compared with those with non-COVID-19 pneumonias, COVID-19 patients appeared to have a more disrupted airway microbiome with frequent potential concurrent infections and a special trigger host immune response in certain pathways, such as interferon-gamma signaling. The immune-associated host transcriptional signatures of COVID-19 hold promise as a tool for improving COVID-19 diagnosis and indicating disease severity."

3596,"A multiple-method comparative study using GC-MS, AMDIS and in-house-built software for the detection and identification of ""unknown"" volatile organic compounds in breath.","The human respiratory system is a highly complex matrix that exhales many volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Breath-exhaled VOCs are often ""unknowns"" and possess low concentrations, which make their analysis, peak digging and data processing challenging. We report a new methodology, applied in a proof-of-concept experiment, for the detection of VOCs in breath. For this purpose, we developed and compared four complementary analysis methods based on solid-phase microextraction and thermal desorption (TD) tubes with two GC-mass spectrometer (MS) methods. Using eight model compounds, we obtained an LOD range of 0.02-20 ng/ml. We found that in breath analysis, sampling the exhausted air from Tedlar bags is better when TD tubes are used, not only because of the preconcentration but also due to the stability of analytes in the TD tubes. Data processing (peak picking) was based on two data retrieval approaches with an in-house script written for comparison and differentiation between two populations: sick and healthy. We found it best to use ""raw"" AMDIS deconvolution data (.ELU) rather than its NIST (.FIN) identification data for comparison between samples. A successful demonstration of this method was conducted in a pilot study (n = 21) that took place in a closed hospital ward (Covid-19 ward) with the discovery of four potential markers. These preliminary findings, at the molecular level, demonstrate the capabilities of our method and can be applied in larger and more comprehensive experiments in the omics world."
3597,A novel One-pot rapid diagnostic technology for COVID-19.,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing global pandemic associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. RT-qPCR has become the diagnostic standard for the testing of SARS-CoV-2 in most countries. COVID-19 diagnosis generally relies upon RT-qPCR-mediated identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, which is costly, labor-extensive, and requires specialized training and equipment. Herein, we established a novel one-tube rapid diagnostic approach based upon formamide and colorimetric RT-LAMP (One-Pot RT-LAMP) that can be used to diagnose COVID-19 without the extraction of specific viral RNA. The technique could visually detect SARS-CoV-2 within 45 min with a limit of detection of 5 copies per reaction in extracted RNA, and about 7.66 virus copies per Î¼L in viral transport medium. The One-Pot RT-LAMP test showed a high specificity without cross-reactivity with 12 viruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human infectious influenza virus (H1N1/H3N2 of influenza A and B virus, ect. We validated this One-Pot RT-LAMP approach by its successful use for the analysis of 45 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples, yielding results identical to those of traditional RT-qPCR analyses, while achieving good selectivity and sensitivity relative to a commercial RT-qPCR approach. As such, this One-Pot RT-LAMP technology may be a valid means of conducting high-sensitivity, low-cost and rapid SARS-CoV-2 identification without the extraction of viral RNA."
3598,COVID-19 diagnosis on CT scan images using a generative adversarial network and concatenated feature pyramid network with an attention mechanism.,"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused hundreds of thousands of infections and deaths. Efficient diagnostic methods could help curb its global spread. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a method for accurately diagnosing COVID-19 based on computed tomography (CT) scans in real time. Methods: We propose an architecture named ""concatenated feature pyramid network"" (""Concat-FPN"") with an attention mechanism, by concatenating feature maps of multiple. The proposed architecture is then used to form two networks, which we call COVID-CT-GAN and COVID-CT-DenseNet, the former for data augmentation and the latter for data classification. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on 3 different numbers of magnitude of COVID-19 CT datasets. Compared with the method without GANs for data augmentation or the original network auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network, COVID-CT-GAN increases the accuracy by 2% to 3%, the recall by 2% to 4%, the precision by 1% to 3%, the F1-score by 1% to 3%, and the area under the curve by 1% to 4%. Compared with the original network DenseNet-201, COVID-CT-DenseNet increases the accuracy by 1% to 3%, the recall by 4% to 9%, the precision by 1%, the F1-score by 1% to 3%, and the area under the curve by 2%. Conclusion: The experimental results show that our method improves the efficiency of diagnosing COVID-19 on CT images, and helps overcome the problem of limited training data when using deep learning methods to diagnose COVID-19. Significance: Our method can help clinicians build deep learning models using their private datasets to achieve automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 with a high precision."
3599,Highly multiplexed oligonucleotide probe-ligation testing enables efficient extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 detection and viral genotyping.,"There is an urgent and unprecedented need for sensitive and high-throughput molecular diagnostic tests to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here we present a generalized version of the RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing Selection and Ligation with next generation DNA sequencing (RASL-seq) assay, called ""capture RASL-seq"" (cRASL-seq), which enables highly sensitive (down to ~1-100 pfu/ml or cfu/ml) and highly multiplexed (up to ~10,000 target sequences) detection of pathogens. Importantly, cRASL-seq analysis of COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens does not involve nucleic acid purification or reverse transcription, steps that have introduced supply bottlenecks into standard assay workflows. Our simplified protocol additionally enables the direct and efficient genotyping of selected, informative SARS-CoV-2 polymorphisms across the entire genome, which can be used for enhanced characterization of transmission chains at population scale and detection of viral clades with higher or lower virulence. Given its extremely low per-sample cost, simple and automatable protocol and analytics, probe panel modularity, and massive scalability, we propose that cRASL-seq testing is a powerful new technology with the potential to help mitigate the current pandemic and prevent similar public health crises."
