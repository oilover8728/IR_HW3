1870,Implementation of a modified drive-through sampling strategy for SARS-CoV-2-the Nigerian experience.,"Introduction: effective and safe means of sample collection is a crucial component of testing for Covid-19. Uptake of testing is key to containing and controlling the spread of the virus. Scientists have been working on various strategies that will increase the uptake of testing for COVID-19. One such method involves the use of the drive-through sampling strategy. Methods: data was collected by both qualitative and quantitative methods. An eligibility form was filled online. While in-depth interviews were conducted for the qualitative aspect of the study. Results: 2,600 visits were recorded at the website, 2300 (88.46%) participants successfully registered for the test. 57.4% were found eligible of which 78.0% presented for the test. This Consisted of 78.0% drive-through and 22.0% walk-in. The average time for transiting through the drive-through site was 19.2 ± 4.6minutes while that of the walk-in was 28 ± 9.2min. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). In the qualitative component, respondents opined that maximum safety measures were deployed to protect both participants and health workers. Most said that the turnaround time for the sampling process was short. Conclusion: the sampling strategy although largely successful, is largely dependent on Internet penetrability, thus this sampling modality will be best utilized as an adjunct to established models of sample collection."
1871,One dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine exponentially increases antibodies in individuals who have recovered from symptomatic COVID-19.,"BACKGROUNDThe COVID-19 vaccines currently in use require 2 doses to achieve optimal protection. Currently, there is no indication as to whether individuals who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should be vaccinated, or whether they should receive 1 or 2 vaccine doses.METHODSWe tested the antibody response developed after administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in 124 health care professionals, of whom 57 had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure with or without symptoms.RESULTSPostvaccine antibodies in SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals increased exponentially within 5 to 18 days after the first dose compared to naive subjects (P < 0.0001). In a multivariate linear regression (LR) model we showed that the antibody response depended on the IgG prevaccine titer and on the exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals, IgG reached a plateau after the second dose, and those who voluntarily refrained from receiving the second dose (n = 7) retained their antibody response. Gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle pain, and fever markedly positively correlated with increased IgG responses. By contrast, all asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic and unexposed individuals showed an important increase after the second dose.CONCLUSIONOne vaccine dose is sufficient in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects to reach a high titer of antibodies, suggesting no need for a second dose, particularly in light of current vaccine shortage.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04387929.FUNDINGDolce & Gabbana and the Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca corrente)."

1873,Effects of Patient Characteristics on Diagnostic Performance of Self-Collected Samples for SARS-CoV-2 Testing.,"We evaluated the performance of self-collected anterior nasal swab (ANS) and saliva samples compared with healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens used to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used the same PCR diagnostic panel to test all self-collected and healthcare worker-collected samples from participants at a public hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Among 1,076 participants, 51.9% were men, 57.1% were >50 years of age, 81.2% were Black (non-Hispanic), and 74.9% reported >1 chronic medical condition. In total, 8.0% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Compared with nasopharyngeal swab samples, ANS samples had a sensitivity of 59% and saliva samples a sensitivity of 68%. Among participants tested 3-7 days after symptom onset, ANS samples had a sensitivity of 80% and saliva samples a sensitivity of 85%. Sensitivity varied by specimen type and patient characteristics. These findings can help physicians interpret PCR results for SARS-CoV-2."
1874,Biomarker Research and Development for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): European Medical Research Infrastructures Call for Global Coordination.,"An effective response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires a better understanding of the biology of the infection and the identification of validated biomarker profiles that would increase the availability, accuracy, and speed of COVID-19 testing. Here, we describe the strategic objectives and action lines of the European Alliance of Medical Research Infrastructures (AMRI), established to improve the research process and tackle challenges related to diagnostic tests and biomarker development. Recommendations include: the creation of a European taskforce for validation of novel diagnostic products, the definition and promotion of criteria for COVID-19 samples biobanking, the identification and validation of biomarkers as clinical endpoints for clinical trials, and the definition of immune biomarker signatures at different stages of the disease. An effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic is possible only if there is a high level of knowledge and coordination between the public and private sectors within a robust quality framework."
1875,[Analysis of human coronaviruses circulation].,"Introduction: The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which emerged at the end of 2019 and caused a worldwide pandemic, triggered numerous questions about the epidemiology of the novel COVID-19 disease and about wellknown coronavirus infections, which used to be given little attention due to their mild symptoms. The purpose: The routine screening-based multiyear retrospective observational study of prevalence and circulation patterns of epidemic-prone human coronaviruses in Moscow. Material and methods: The real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect RNA of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in nasal and throat swabs from 16,511 patients with an acute respiratory infection (ARI), aged 1 month to 95 years (children accounted for 58.3%) from January 2016 to March 2020, and swabs from 505 relatively healthy children in 2008, 2010 and 2011. Results. HCoVs were yearly found in 2.6-6.1% of the examined patients; the detection frequency was statistically higher in adults than in children, regardless of sex. At the height of the disease incidence in December 2019, HCoVs were detected in 13.7% of the examined, demonstrating a two-fold increase as compared to the multi-year average for that month. The statistical frequency of HCoV detection in ARI pediatric patients under 6 years was significantly higher than in their healthy peers (3.7 vs 0.7%, p = 0.008). Conclusion: HCoVs circulate annually, demonstrating a winter-spring seasonal activity pattern in the Moscow Region and reaching peak levels in December. Over the years of observation, the HCoV epidemic activity reached maximum levels in December 2019-February 2020 and decreased in March to the multi-year average. Amid a growing number of SARS-CoV-2 cases imported to Moscow in March 2020, the HCoV detection frequency dropped sharply, which can be explained by the competition between different coronaviruses and by the specificity of HCoV detection with the diagnostic test kit used in this study."

1877,Timeliness and completeness of laboratory-based surveillance of COVID-19 cases in England.,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate completeness and timeliness of the rapidly developed surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in England using patient-level data. Study design: This is an observational study wherein public health surveillance systems are evaluated. Methods: Data were collected in the Public Health England's Second-Generation Surveillance System through routine laboratory reporting processes, as well as via enhanced testing in collaboration with commercial partners. Three periods were chosen to present developments in disease surveillance around the first pandemic wave in England. Completeness of valid entries for key demographic and epidemiological fields was summarised. Timeliness was assessed using recorded date intervals: from sample collection to the laboratory reporting a positive result, the positive result being received by the national surveillance system and the data being available for epidemiological analysis. Results: In each period, demographic variables were more than 95% complete and enhanced ethnicity more than 85%, allowing a rich understanding of the general characteristics of COVID-19 cases in England. The proportion of cases completing all reporting stages of the national system within 3 days of when the specimen was taken increased from 69.1% in period 1 to 76.6% in period 3. In period 3, the median number of days to complete all reporting stages decreased to 2, from 3 in previous periods. Analysis of each reporting stage offers suggestive evidence that timeliness of the system has improved as reporting has become established over time. Conclusions: Timely processing of data for epidemiological use was consistent and rapid once received by the national system. Delays in timeliness were most likely to occur in the first stage of the reporting process, before laboratory input to the surveillance platform. Existing national surveillance mechanisms enhanced during the response have succeeded in providing rapid collection and reporting of case data to facilitate epidemiological monitoring and analysis and guide public health policy and strategy."
1878,COVID-19: Characteristics and Therapeutics.,"Novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2), which suddenly emerged in December 2019 is still haunting the entire human race and has affected not only the healthcare system but also the global socioeconomic balances. COVID-19 was quickly designated as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization as there have been about 98.0 million confirmed cases and about 2.0 million confirmed deaths, as of January 2021. Although, our understanding of COVID-19 has significantly increased since its outbreak, and multiple treatment approaches and pharmacological interventions have been tested or are currently under development to mitigate its risk-factors. Recently, some vaccine candidates showed around 95% clinical efficacy, and now receiving emergency use approvals in different countries. US FDA recently approved BNT162 and mRNA-1273 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Inc. for emergency use and vaccination in the USA. In this review, we present a succinct overview of the SARS-CoV-2 virus structure, molecular mechanisms of infection, COVID-19 epidemiology, diagnosis, and clinical manifestations. We also systematize different treatment strategies and clinical trials initiated after the pandemic outbreak, based on viral infection and replication mechanisms. Additionally, we reviewed the novel pharmacological intervention approaches and vaccine development strategies against COVID-19. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will trigger detailed studies of coronaviruses, their mechanism of infection, development of systematic drug repurposing approaches, and novel drug discoveries for current and future pandemic outbreaks."
1879,Assessment and management of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection: A systematic review.,"Background: COVID-19 can be asymptomatic in a substantial proportion of patients. The assessment and management of these patients constitute a key element to stop dissemination. Aim: To describe the assessment and treatment of asymptomatic infection in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: We searched five databases and search engines for preprints/preproofs, up to August 22, 2020. We included cohort, cross-sectional, and case series studies, reporting the assessment and management of asymptomatic individuals. We extracted data on total discharges with negative PCR, length of hospitalization, treatment, and number of patients who remained asymptomatic. A random-effects model with inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled prevalence. Results: 41 studies (nine cross-sectional studies, five retrospective studies and 27 reports/case series; 647 asymptomatic individuals), were included, of which 47% were male (233/501). The age of patients was between 1month and 73 years. In patients who became symptomatic, length of hospitalization mean was 13.6 days (SD 6.4). Studies used lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine plus ritonavir/lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin, ribavirin plus interferon and interferon alfa. The proportion of individuals who remained asymptomatic was 91% (463/588 patients; 95%CI: 78.3%-98.7%); and asymptomatic individuals discharged with negative PCR was 86% (102/124 individuals; 95%CI: 58.4%-100%). Conclusions: There is no standard treatment for asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals. There are no studies of adequate design to make this decision. It has been shown that most asymptomatic individuals who were followed have recovered, but this cannot be attributed to standard treatment."
