9100,Anti-spike S1 receptor-binding domain antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 persist several months after infection regardless of disease severity.,"Data regarding the immunological memory and long-time kinetics of immunoglobulin (IgG) against viral nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein S1 receptor-binding domain (S1RBD) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are lacking. All consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our Clinic between March 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020, who were tested at hospital admission for anti-S1RBD and anti-NP IgG were enrolled. Serum samples were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the use of two commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results are expressed as optical density measurements at 450 nm (OD450 ). Overall, 111 patients were included; the median (q1-q3) age was 57 (49-73) years, 59 (53%) males. According to disease severity, 31 (28%), 47 (42%), and 33 (30%) patients were considered affected by mild/moderate, severe, and critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively. During hospitalization, patients with the critical disease showed a higher peak value of both anti-NP (median OD450 : 3.66 vs. 3.06 vs. 3.00 respectively, p = .043) and anti-S1RBD IgG (median OD450 : 2.33 vs. 1.6 vs. 0.91, respectively, p < .001). By testing 48 subjects 6 months or above from discharge, a significant decrease of anti-NP IgG was observed (r: -0.5838; p < .0001), whereas anti-S1RBD IgG showed only a modest reduction (r: -0.1507; p = .0647). Accordingly, 10 (21%) and 2 (4%) patients had a negative serological status for anti-NP and anti-S1RBD IgG, respectively; no association with clinical severity was found. IgGs against SARS-CoV-2 persisted several months after discharge, regardless of disease severity, suggesting that vaccination could be a valid strategy to fight the pandemic."

9102,ADP-ribosylhydrolases: from DNA damage repair to COVID-19.,"Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation is a unique post-translational modification that regulates many biological processes, such as DNA damage repair. During DNA repair, ADP-ribosylation needs to be reversed by ADP-ribosylhydrolases. A group of ADP-ribosylhydrolases have a catalytic domain, namely the macrodomain, which is conserved in evolution from prokaryotes to humans. Not all macrodomains remove ADP-ribosylation. One set of macrodomains loses enzymatic activity and only binds to ADP-ribose (ADPR). Here, we summarize the biological functions of these macrodomains in DNA damage repair and compare the structure of enzymatically active and inactive macrodomains. Moreover, small molecular inhibitors have been developed that target macrodomains to suppress DNA damage repair and tumor growth. Macrodomain proteins are also expressed in pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, these domains may not be directly involved in DNA damage repair in the hosts or pathogens. Instead, they play key roles in pathogen replication. Thus, by targeting macrodomains it may be possible to treat pathogen-induced diseases, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
9103,Early cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda: epidemiology and lessons learned from risk-based testing approaches - March-April 2020.,"Background: On March 13, 2020, Uganda instituted COVID-19 symptom screening at its international airport, isolation and SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic persons, and mandatory 14-day quarantine and testing of persons traveling through or from high-risk countries. On March 21, 2020, Uganda reported its first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a symptomatic traveler from Dubai. By April 12, 2020, 54 cases and 1257 contacts were identified. We describe the epidemiological, clinical, and transmission characteristics of these cases. Methods: A confirmed case was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during March 21-April 12, 2020 in a resident of or traveler to Uganda. We reviewed case-person files and interviewed case-persons at isolation centers. We identified infected contacts from contact tracing records. Results: Mean case-person age was 35 (±16) years; 34 (63%) were male. Forty-five (83%) had recently traveled internationally ('imported cases'), five (9.3%) were known contacts of travelers, and four (7.4%) were community cases. Of the 45 imported cases, only one (2.2%) was symptomatic at entry. Among all case-persons, 29 (54%) were symptomatic at testing and five (9.3%) were pre-symptomatic. Among the 34 (63%) case-persons who were ever symptomatic, all had mild disease: 16 (47%) had fever, 13 (38%) reported headache, and 10 (29%) reported cough. Fifteen (28%) case-persons had underlying conditions, including three persons with HIV. An average of 31 contacts (range, 4-130) were identified per case-person. Five (10%) case-persons, all symptomatic, infected one contact each. Conclusion: The first 54 case-persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda primarily comprised incoming air travelers with asymptomatic or mild disease. Disease would likely not have been detected in these persons without the targeted testing interventions implemented in Uganda. Transmission was low among symptomatic persons and nonexistent from asymptomatic persons. Routine, systematic screening of travelers and at-risk persons, and thorough contact tracing will be needed for Uganda to maintain epidemic control."
9104,"The Novel Coronavirus and Haemostatic Abnormalities: Pathophysiology, Clinical Manifestations, and Treatment Recommendations.","The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-C0V-2 virus, was initially considered and managed in a similar manner to the previous SARS epidemic as they are both caused by coronaviruses. What has now become apparent is that a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 is abnormal thrombosis. This thrombosis occurs on a macro- and microvascular level and is unique to this disease. The virus has been demonstrated in the endothelium of the pulmonary alveoli and as such is thought to contribute to the devastating respiratory complications encountered. D-dimer concentrations are frequently raised in COVID to levels not frequently seen previously. The optimal anticoagulation treatment in COVID remains to be determined, and the myriad of pathophysiologic effects caused by this virus in the human host have also yet to be fully elucidated."
9105,"Desperate Times, Desperate Measures: The Case for RRx-001 in the Treatment of COVID-19.","This article summarizes the likely attenuation properties of RRx-001 in COVID-19 based on its mechanism of action and the putative pathogenesis of the disease, which appears to activate inflammatory, oxidative, and immune cascades with the potential to culminate in acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm and death. An ongoing pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 appears to present with 3 major patterns of clinical symptomatology: (1) mild upper respiratory tract infection, (2) non-life-threatening pneumonia, and (3) severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome that initially manifest as a mild prodrome lasting for 7-8 days before rapid clinical and radiological deterioration requiring ICU transfer. RRx-001 is a targeted nitric oxide donor. This small molecule, which has been evaluated in multiple Phase 1-2 clinical trials for cancer as well as a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of small cell lung cancer called REPLATINUM (NCT03699956), is minimally toxic and demonstrates clear evidence of antitumor activity. During the course of these clinical trials it was noted that the rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and pneumonia in actively smoking small cell lung cancer patients treated with RRx-001 is less than 1%. Due to extensive history of tobacco use, 40%-70% of patients with lung cancer have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the expected rate of pulmonary infection in this population is 50%-70%, which was not observed in RRx-001 clinical trials. Moreover, in preclinical studies of pulmonary hypertension, RRx-001 was found to be comparable with or more effective than the FDA approved agent, Bosentan. The potential pulmonary protective effects of RRx-001 in patients with recurrent lung infections coupled with preclinical models demonstrating RRx-001-mediated reversal of pulmonary hypertension suggests RRx-001 may have therapeutic activity in patients with acute respiratory symptoms due to COVID 19. Clinical trials have been initiated to confirm the hypothesis that RRx-001 may be repurposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection."
9106,Daytime variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine production.,"S. Ray and A. Reddy recently anticipated the implication of circadian rhythm in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In addition to its key role in the regulation of biological functions, the circadian rhythm has been suggested as a regulator of viral infections. Specifically, the time of day of infection was found critical for illness progression, as has been reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. We analyzed circadian rhythm implication in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of isolated human monocytes, key actor cells in Covid-19 disease, from healthy subjects. The circadian gene expression of BMAL1 and CLOCK genes was investigated with q-RTPCR. Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and viral infection was investigated by One-Step qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IL-10 levels were also measured in supernatants of infected monocytes. Using Cosinor analysis, we showed that BMAL1 and CLOCK transcripts exhibited circadian rhythm in monocytes with an acrophase and a bathyphase at Circadian Time (CT)6 and CT17. After 48 h, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus increased in the monocyte infected at CT6 compared to CT17. The high virus amount at CT6 was associated with significant increased release in IL-6, IL-1β and IL-10 compared to CT17. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression."
