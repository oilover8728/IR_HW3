1651,"COVID-19 patients age, comorbidity profiles and clinical presentation related to the SARS-CoV-2 UK-variant spread in the Southeast of France.","The variant 20I/501Y.V1, associated to a higher risk of transmissibility, emerged in Nice city (Southeast of France, French Riviera) during January 2021. The pandemic has resumed late December 2020 in this area. A high incidence rate together with a fast turn-over of the main circulating variants, provided us the opportunity to analyze modifications in clinical profile and outcome traits. We performed an observational study in the University hospital of Nice from December 2020 to February 2021. We analyzed data of sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from the sewage collector and PCR screening from all positive samples at the hospital. Then, we described the characteristics of all COVID-19 patients admitted in the emergency department (ED) (n = 1247) and those hospitalized in the infectious diseases ward or ICU (n = 232). The UK-variant was absent in this area in December, then increasingly spread in January representing 59% of the PCR screening performed mid-February. The rate of patients over 65 years admitted to the ED decreased from 63 to 50% (p = 0.001). The mean age of hospitalized patients in the infectious diseases ward decreased from 70.7 to 59.2 (p < 0.001) while the proportion of patients without comorbidity increased from 16 to 42% (p = 0.007). Spread of the UK-variant in the Southeast of France affects younger and healthier patients."
1652,"Low SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Elementary Schools - Salt Lake County, Utah, December 3, 2020-January 31, 2021.","School closures affected more than 55 million students across the United States when implemented as a strategy to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). Reopening schools requires balancing the risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection to students and staff members against the benefits of in-person learning (2). During December 3, 2020-January 31, 2021, CDC investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 20 elementary schools (kindergarten through grade 6) that had reopened in Salt Lake County, Utah. The 7-day cumulative number of new COVID-19 cases in Salt Lake County during this time ranged from 290 to 670 cases per 100,000 persons.† Susceptible§ school contacts¶ (students and staff members exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in school) of 51 index patients** (40 students and 11 staff members) were offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Among 1,041 susceptible school contacts, 735 (70.6%) were tested, and five of 12 cases identified were classified as school-associated; the secondary attack rate among tested susceptible school contacts was 0.7%. Mask use among students was high (86%), and the median distance between students' seats in classrooms was 3 ft. Despite high community incidence and an inability to maintain ≥6 ft of distance between students at all times, SARS-CoV-2 transmission was low in these elementary schools. The results from this investigation add to the increasing evidence that in-person learning can be achieved with minimal SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk when multiple measures to prevent transmission are implemented (3,4)."

1655,Engineering of the current nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.,"Currently, there are over 230 different COVID-19 vaccines under development around the world. At least three decades of scientific development in RNA biology, immunology, structural biology, genetic engineering, chemical modification, and nanoparticle technologies allowed the accelerated development of fully synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines within less than a year since the first report of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. mRNA-based vaccines have been shown to elicit broadly protective immune responses, with the added advantage of being amenable to rapid and flexible manufacturing processes. This review recapitulates current advances in engineering the first two SARS-CoV-2-spike-encoding nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines, highlighting the strategies followed to potentiate their effectiveness and safety, thus facilitating an agile response to the current COVID-19 pandemic."
1656,Validation of High-Sensitivity Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Testing for Stool-Toward the New Normal for Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.,"Introduction: Mounting evidence demonstrates potential for fecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The US Food and Drug Administration now requires SARS-CoV-2 testing of potential feces donors before the use of stool manufactured for fecal microbiota transplantation. We sought to develop and validate a high-sensitivity SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure for testing stool specimens. Methods: A modified extraction method was used with an RT-PCR assay adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PCR protocol for respiratory specimens. Contrived specimens were created using pre-COVID-19 banked stool specimens and spiking in known concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific nucleic acid. The highest transcript concentration at which 2/2 or 1/2 SARS-CoV-2 targets were detected in 9/10 replicates was defined as the dual-target limit and single-target limit of detection, respectively. The clinical performance of the assay was evaluated with stool samples collected from 17 nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR-positive patients and 14 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR-negative patients. Results: The dual-target and single-target limit of detection were 56 copies/μL and 3 copies/μL, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was detected at concentrations as low as 0.6 copies/μL. Clinical stool samples from known COVID-19-positive patients demonstrated the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool up to 29 days from symptom onset with a high agreement with nasopharyngeal swab tests (kappa statistic of 0.95, P value < 0.001). Discussion: The described RT-PCR test is a sensitive and flexible approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool specimens. We propose an integrated screening approach that incorporates this stool test to support continuation of fecal microbiota transplantation programs."
1657,Use of a simplified sample processing step without RNA extraction for direct SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR detection.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in significant shortages of RT-PCR testing supplies including RNA extraction kits. The goal of our study was to determine if a simplified heat-RNA release method would provide comparable detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid extraction. RT-PCR results using the ChromaCode HDPCR™ SARS-CoV-2 were compared using the heat-RNA release method and an automated RNA extraction system (EMAG). The heat-RNA release method correctly identified 94 % (81/86 nasopharyngeal samples) that were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Five samples that were missed by heat-RNA release method had a mean Ct value: 35 using the automated extraction instrument, indicating a very low viral load. Our findings show that a simple heat-RNA release method is a reasonable alternative for the majority of COVID-19 positive patients and can help overcome the cost and availability issues of RNA extraction reagents."
1658,Clinical Performance of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Tests Using an Automated Chemiluminescent Assay.,"Serology tests for viral antibodies provide an important tool to support nucleic acid testing for diagnosis of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is useful for documenting previous exposures to SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The sensitivities of the chemiluminescent SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM immunoassay were assessed by using serum samples collected from 728 patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The specificity was evaluated on a panel of 60 serum samples from non-COVID-19 patients with high levels of rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, or antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), mycoplasma pneumonia, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza A or influenza B. The imprecision and interference were assessed by adopting the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP15-A2 and EP7-A2, respectively. Sensitivities between 1 and 65 days after onset of symptoms were 94.4% and 78.7%, for IgG and IgM test, respectively. The sensitivity increased with the time after symptom onset, and rose to the top on the 22nd to 28th days. The total imprecision (CVs) was less than 6.0% for IgG and less than 6.5% for IgM. Limited cross-reactions with antibodies against EBV, CMV, mycoplasma pneumonia, human RSV, adenovirus, influenza A or influenza B were found. These data suggested the chemiluminescent SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, assay with reliable utility and sensitivity, could be used for rapid screening and retrospective surveillance of COVID-19."
1659,A reduction of the number of assays and turnaround time by optimizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) pooled testing for SARS-CoV-2.,"Early detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can decrease the spread of the disease and provide therapeutic options promptly in affected individuals. However, the diagnosis by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is costly and time-consuming. Several methods of group testing have been developed to overcome this problem. The proposed strategy offers optimization of group testing according to the available resources by decreasing not only the number of the assays but also the turnaround time. The initial classification of the samples would be done according to the intention of testing defined as diagnostic or screening/surveillance, achieving the best possible homogeneity. The proposed stratification of pooling is based on branching (divisions) and depth (levels of re-pooling) of the original group in association with the estimated probability of a positive sample. The dilutional effect of the grouped samples has also been considered. The margins of minimum and maximum conservation of assays of pooled specimens are calculated and the optimum strategy can be selected in association with the probability of positive samples in the original group. This algorithm intends to be a useful tool for group testing offering a choice of strategies according to the requirements."
