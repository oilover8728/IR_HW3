3472,Modelling pool testing for SARS-CoV-2: addressing heterogeneity in populations.,"Amplifying the testing capacity and making better use of testing resources is a crucial measure when fighting any pandemic. A pooled testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 has theoretically been shown to increase the testing capacity of a country, especially when applied in low prevalence settings. Experimental studies have shown that the sensitivity of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is not affected when implemented in small groups. Previous models estimated the optimum group size as a function of the historical prevalence; however, this implies a homogeneous distribution of the disease within the population. This study aimed to explore whether separating individuals by age groups when pooling samples results in any further savings on test kits or affects the optimum group size estimation compared to Dorfman's pooling, based on historical prevalence. For this evaluation, age groups of interest were defined as 0-19 years, 20-59 years and over 60 years old. Generalisation of Dorfman's pooling was performed by adding statistical weight to the age groups based on the number of confirmed cases and tests performed in the segment. The findings showed that when the pooling samples are based on age groups, there is a decrease in the number of tests per subject needed to diagnose one subject. Although this decrease is minuscule, it might account for considerable savings when applied on a large scale. In addition, the savings are considerably higher in settings where there is a high standard deviation among the positivity rate of the age segments of the general population."

Healthcare-acquired infection has been reported in similar epidemics, but there are limited data on the prevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs and their associated clinical outcomes in the United States. Methods: We established 2 high-throughput employee testing centers in Seattle, Washington, with drive-through and walk-through options for symptomatic employees in the University of Washington Medicine system and its affiliated organizations. Using data from these testing centers, we report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among symptomatic employees and describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes among employees with COVID-19. Results: Between 12 March 2020 and 23 April 2020, 3477 symptomatic employees were tested for COVID-19 at 2 employee testing centers; 185 (5.3%) employees tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was similar when comparing frontline HCWs (5.2%) with nonfrontline staff (5.5%). Among 174 positive employees reached for follow-up at least 14 days after diagnosis, 6 reported COVID-related hospitalization; all recovered. Conclusions: During the study period, we observed that the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests among symptomatic HCWs was comparable to that of symptomatic nonfrontline staff. Reliable and rapid access to testing for employees is essential to preserve the health, safety, and availability of the healthcare workforce during this pandemic and to facilitate the rapid return of SARS-CoV-2-negative employees to work."

SARS-CoV-2 spread globally with >28 million cases and 911,000 deaths recorded worldwide as of September 12, 2020. The Philippines reported the first case of community transmission on March 5, 2020, and despite the government imposing one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in Southeast Asia, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases still surged with >250,000 cases and 4,000 deaths reported as of September 12, 2020. It is important to estimate the burden and impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the military population since this can affect the military readiness. Materials and methods: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR testing was performed on the samples. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using sequences from 23 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens from this study and sequences retrieved from GenBank and GISAID databases. Results: From April 14 to August 15, 2020, a total of 12,432 specimens were tested with 763 (6%) unique individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. In the military population, majority of the patients who were tested (80%) and those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (86%) were male. Military and civilian status was available for 7,672 patients with 515/5,042 (10%) positive among military patients and 248/2,630 (9%) positive among civilian patients. Both military and civilian populations had the highest case counts of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases in the 21- to 30- and 31- to 40-year-old age groups, while the 71- to 80-year-old age group had the highest proportion (18%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Sequencing analysis showed 19 different variants in the 23 genomes. Twenty of the 23 genomes were classified under clade GR/B1.1, 2 genomes were classified under clade GR/B1.1.28, and 1 genome was classified under Clade O/B.6. Twenty-two of the 23 sequences collected after June 25, 2020, contained the D614G mutation. Conclusion: We describe here the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing for military and civilian patients and personnel. The 21- to 30- and 31- to 40-year-old age groups had the highest case counts of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Sequencing results showed the presence of the D614G mutation in the spike protein in a majority of specimens collected from the end of June to July 2020."
