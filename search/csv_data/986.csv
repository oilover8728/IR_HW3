9850,[Medical applications of ionising radiation for the diagnosis of coronavirus-associated lung disease : Statement by the German Commission on Radiological Protection].,"Issue: Since the start of the global pandemic, a number of publications have suggested using ionising radiation to diagnose a COVID-19 infection. Some proposals call for the use of computed tomography (CT) to screen for presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infections. Intent of the consultation: With these proposals in mind, the German Commission on Radiological Protection (SSK) agreed during its 307th meeting on 2 and 3 July 2020 to establish a working group aimed at evaluating the use of ionising radiation in connection with a COVID-19 infection. The working group focussed on radiological protection aspects with a view to using computed tomography to diagnose COVID-19. The group started its work on 5 October 2020. Although not commissioned by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), representatives of the BMU and the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) were involved in the consultations. Statement: The SSK issues the following statement: 1. The use of CT in asymptomatic persons to diagnose COVID-19 outside of approved studies is not evidentially justified. 2. Pursuant to Section 83 (3) of the German Radiation Protection Act, a CT scan for the diagnosis or follow-up of a COVID-19 pneumonia requires the prior justifying indication from a doctor with the requisite specialist knowledge in radiation protection. To this end, specialist medical associations provide recommendations based on up-to-date findings."
9851,Influence of aluminum salts on COVID-19 infected patients.,"Background/aim: Based on the antiviral and antibacterial properties of aluminum salts, we aimed to find out the influence of aluminum salts on COVID-19 infected patients. Materials and methods: We performed an observational retrospective cohort study which includes the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 and received aluminum salts in addition to actual treatments during hospitalization as the treatment group (Alum Group). Patients who received standard COVID-19 treatment protocols in the Infectious Diseases Clinics were included as the Control Group. Clinical findings, laboratory parameters, length of stay, survival, radiological follow-up, intensive care and mechanical ventilation needs, the presence of comorbidity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, symptoms, symptom recovery times, hospital stay times, treatment protocols, and clinical presence of pneumonia were examined in all patients. Advanced chemical composition analyzes of existing aluminum salts were also performed. Results: A total of 109 patients, 54 in the alum group and 55 in the control group, were included in the study. None of the patients in the aluminum group developed side effects due to the intake of aluminum salt. Survival status was significantly different between the two groups as there were 5 loss in the Control Group and none in the Alum Group (P = 0.023). The symptom recovery time was significantly shorter in the Alum Group; 2 (1–3) vs. 1 (1–2) days, P = 0.003. According to the paired samples analyses of the comparison between hospitalization and discharge, CRP levels significantly drops in the Alum Group (from 54.09 to 27, P = 0.001) but not in the Control Group. The drop was significantly same for the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and procalcitonin levels with P = 0.001. Conclusion: It has been observed that aluminum salts have beneficial effects in COVID-19 infected cases. Considering the low systemic toxicity of intermittent oral intake of aluminum salts as food supplements and the fact that pandemic control is still not achieved, the use of aluminum salts is promising."
9852,The potential danger of suboptimal antibody responses in COVID-19.,"There is a desperate need for effective therapies and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the growing economic crisis that has ensued from societal lockdown. Vaccines are being developed at an unprecedented speed and are already in clinical trials, without preclinical testing for safety and efficacy. Yet, safety evaluation of candidate vaccines must not be overlooked."

9855,Assessing the consequences of environmental exposures on the expression of the human receptor and proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell-entry.,"The role of environmental condition on the infection by the novel pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 virus remains uncertain. In here, exploiting a large panel of publicly available genome-wide data, we investigated whether the human receptor ACE2 and human proteases TMPRSS2, FURIN and CATHEPSINs (B, L and V), which are involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, are transcriptionally regulated by environmental cues. We report that more than 50 chemicals modulate the expression of ACE2 or human proteases important for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. We further demonstrate that transcription factor AhR, which is commonly activated by pollutants, binds to the promoter of TMPRSS2 and enhancers and/or promoters of Cathepsin B, L and V encoding genes. Our exploratory study documents an influence of environmental exposures on the expression of genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. These results could be conceptually and medically relevant to our understanding of the COVID-19 disease, and should be further explored in laboratory and epidemiologic studies."

These circumstances have stopped the activity of almost the entire world, affecting severely the global economy. A rapid diagnosis of the Covid-19 and a generalized testing protocol is essential to fight against the pandemic and to maintain health control in the population. Principal biosensing and diagnostic technologies used to monitor the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 are based on specific genomic analysis and rapid immune tests, both with different technology platforms that include advantages and disadvantages. Most of the in vitro diagnosis companies are competing to be the first on validating under different regulations their technology for placing their platforms for Covid-19 detection as fast as possible in this big international market. A comprehensive analysis of the commercialized technologies for the genomic based sensing and the antibody/antigen detection methods devoted to Covid-19 diagnosis is described in this review, which have been detailed and listed under different countries regulations. The effectiveness of the described technologies throughout the different stages of the disease and a critical comparison of the emerging technologies in the market to counterattack this pandemic have been discussed."
9858,[Early differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and mycoplasma pneumonia with chest CT scan].,"Objective: To early differentiate between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and adult mycoplasma pneumonia with chest CT scan. Methods: Twenty-six patients with COVID-19 and 21 patients with adult mycoplasma pneumonia confirmed with RT-PCR test were enrolled from Zibo First Hospital and Lanshan People's Hospital during December 1st 2019 and March 14th 2020. The early chest CT manifestations were analyzed and compared between the two groups. Results: The interstitial changes with ground glass density shadow (GGO) were similar in two groups during first chest CT examination (P>0.05). There were more lung lobes involved on the first chest CT in COVID-19 patients, which were mostly distributed in the dorsal outer zone (23/26, 88.5%), and nearly half of them (12/26, 46.2%) were accompanied by crazy-paving sign; while the lesions in adult mycoplasma pneumonia patients were mostly distributed along the bronchi, and the bronchial wall was thickened (19/21, 90.5%), accompanied with tree buds / fog signs (19/21, 90.5%). The above CT signs were significantly different between the two kinds of pneumonia (all P<0.01). COVID-19 had a longer course compared with mycoplasma pneumonia, the disease peaks of COVID-19 patients was on day (10.5±3.8), while the disease on CT was almost absorbed on day (7.9±2.2) in adult mycoplasma pneumonia. The length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients was significantly longer than that of mycoplasma pneumonia patients [(19.5±4.3) d vs (7.9±2.2) d, P<0.01]. Conclusions: The lesions of adult mycoplasma pneumonia are mostly distributed along the bronchi with tree buds/fog signs, while the lesions of COVID-19 are mainly distributed in the dorsal outer zone accompanied by crazy-paving sign, which can early distinguish two diseases."
9859,"[The ESC recommendations for COVID-19-no guideline, but a learning guidance].","""Not a guideline but a guidance"" is the motto of this document of guidance by the European Society of Cardiology, which is designed as an orientation aid to learning for physicians in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 62 European cardiologists as authors and 29 further experts as reviewers have contributed to this 119-page document. The emphasis of the guidelines is on a cautious strategy in dealing with a pandemic, which is still characterized by many unknown factors. It is consciously limited to cardiovascular diseases. In the last update from 10 June 2020 many practical instructions for cardiovascular diagnostics and treatment under the conditions of a pandemic are given. These recommendations largely depend on the already well-known guidelines of the ESC. To recapitulate them might be helpful but much is redundant. The sections on the pathophysiology and pathomechanisms by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could specifically affect the cardiovascular system, are informative but sometimes in need of supplementation. It is counterproductive to recommend that pathohistological and molecular investigations of tissues from affected and deceased patients should be avoided. This document of guidance is an ambitious attempt of a learning recommendation that needs some further improvement. It needs an early update if it intends to do justice to the ambitions."
