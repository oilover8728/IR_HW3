2130,Marketing the COVID-19 vaccine and the implications for public health.,"COVID-19 vaccines are new brands of consumer health technology being introduced to the market. Considering consumer behaviour approaches in this time of crisis, the risk of vaccine hesitancy, the call for more transparency and effective messaging to gain trust, and equitable distribution of this vaccine, this is unexplored theoretical terrain. This commentary takes a multidisciplinary approach to understand and theoretically explore the marketing, distribution, and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. The paper integrates marketing principles, including advertisement and branding of consumer health technology with supply chain management, public affairs, and public health. A theoretical framework was presented to illustrate this relationship and key areas of concerns. The practical implications relevant to equity, ethics, education, employment, and the economic impact was presented."
2131,"COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Nepal, emerging UK variant and futuristic vaccination strategies to combat the ongoing pandemic.","With the emergence of the new variants of concern (VOC) of the SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy of certain vaccines against them requires further research and considerations for future scenarios of COVID-19 vaccination. The vaccines' lack of efficacy against VOC will pose at risk to the vaccinated population and is a public health threat. In this commentary, we discuss Nepal's recent experiences and expectations regarding the confirmation of VOC B.1.1.7 from the United Kingdom in the country."
2132,New molecular diagnostic technologies for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an ongoing pandemic of new coronavirus pneumonia (corona virus disease 2019, COVID-19). The virus has a long incubation period and strong infectivity, which poses a major threat to global health and safety. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid lies at the center of rapid detection of COVID-19, which is instrumental for mitigation of the ongoing pandemic. As of August 17, 2020, The National Medical Products Administration in China has approved 15 new coronavirus nucleic acid detection kits, 10 kits of which are based on reverse transcription-real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) technology. The remaining kits use five molecular diagnostic technologies different from RT-qPCR. This article reviews the principles, reaction time, advantages and disadvantages of above 15 detection kits, in order to provide references for rapid screening, diagnosis, prevention and control of COVID-19 and similar infectious diseases."
2133,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Seattle, Washington: October 2019-April 2020.","Background: The first US case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected on January 20, 2020. However, some serology studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 may have been present in the United States prior to that, as early as December 2019. The extent of domestic COVID-19 detection prior to 2020 has not been well-characterized. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among healthcare users in the greater Seattle, Washington area from October 2019 through early April 2020. Study design: We tested residual samples from 766 Seattle-area adults for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies utilizing an ELISA against prefusion-stabilized Spike (S) protein. Results: No antibody-positive samples were found between October 2, 2019 and March 13, 2020. Prevalence rose to 1.2% in late March and early April 2020. Conclusions: The absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive samples in October 2019 through mid-March, 2020, provides evidence against widespread circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare users in the Seattle area during that time. A small proportion of this metropolitan-area cohort had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by spring of 2020."
2134,Robust Multichannel Encoding for Highly Multiplexed Quantitative PCR.,"The gold standard of molecular pathogen detection is the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Modern qPCR instruments are capable of detecting 4-6 analytes in a single sample: one per optical detection channel. However, many clinical applications require multiplexing beyond this traditional single-well capacity, including the task of simultaneously testing for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens. This can be addressed by dividing a sample across multiple wells, or using technologies such as genomic sequencing and spatial arrays, but at the expense of significantly higher cost and lower throughput compared with single-well qPCR. These trade-offs represent unacceptable compromises in high-throughput screening scenarios such as SARS-CoV-2 testing. We demonstrate a novel method of detecting up to 20 targets per well with standard qPCR instrumentation: high-definition PCR (HDPCR). HDPCR combines TaqMan chemistry and familiar workflows with robust encoding to enable far higher levels of multiplexing on a traditional qPCR system without an increase in cost or reduction in throughput. We utilize HDPCR with a custom 20-Plex assay, an 8-Plex assay using unmodified predesigned single-plex assays from Integrated DNA Technologies and a 9-Plex pathogen panel inclusive of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. All three assays were successful when tested on a variety of samples, with overall sample accuracies of 98.8, 98.3, and 100%, respectively. The HDPCR technology enables the large install base of qPCR instrumentation to perform mid-density multiplex diagnostics without modification to instrumentation or workflow, meeting the urgent need for increased diagnostic yield at an affordable price without sacrificing assay performance."

2136,Limited clinical value of early repeat RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.,
2137,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 among vaccinated health care workers.,"Background: Vaccination against COVID-19 is among the most effective measures to stop the spread of the disease. However, acceptance of vaccination against COVID-19 among HCWs has not been universal and emergence of new variants with increased transmissibility, reduced neutralization by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited sera and ability to cause breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals is concerning. The aim of this study was to compare viral load, clinical presentation at diagnosis and type of exposure among vaccinated (with BNT162b2) and non-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods: Prospective cohort of HWCs diagnosed with COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal PCR from 4 January to 14 April. Viral loads were expressed by the cycle threshold (Ct) in PCR. Results: During the study period 55 HCWs were found positive for SARS-CoV-2, most of whom (44/55) were identified from March 28 to April 14 during an in-hospital COVID-19 outbreak. Of the 55 HCWs, 21 were fully vaccinated and another three had received one dose. Most cases (54/55) were due to variant B.1.1.7. Vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs did not differ significantly in regards to age, gender, site of acquisition, presence of symptoms at diagnosis and viral load. Conclusions: This study found a similar viral load in vaccinated and non-vaccinated HCWs infected by SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7, suggesting potentially reduced efficacy of BNT162b2 in preventing transmission of B.1.1.7."
2138,Tergitol-15-S-9 inactivates SARS-CoV-2 and boosts immunoassay signals.,"Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus is necessary to mitigate risk but may interfere with diagnostic assay performance. We examined the effect of heat inactivation on a prototype SARS-CoV-2 antigen immunoassay run on the ARCHITECT automated analyzer. Recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and virus lysate detection was reduced by 66 and 31%, respectively. Several nonionic detergents were assessed as inactivation alternatives based on infectivity in cultured Vero CCL81 cells. Incubation of SARS-CoV-2 in 0.1% Tergitol 15-S-9 for 10 min significantly reduced infectivity and increased the immunoassay signal for cultured lysate and patient specimens. Tergitol 15-S-9 can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 while preserving epitopes on the nucleocapsid protein for enhanced detection by immunoassay antibodies."
2139,The dawn of mRNA vaccines: The COVID-19 case.,"In less than one year since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, two mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, were granted the first historic authorization for emergency use, while another mRNA vaccine, CVnCoV, progressed to phase 3 clinical testing. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines represent a new class of vaccine products, which consist of synthetic mRNA strands encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, packaged in lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA to cells. This review digs deeper into the scientific breakthroughs of the last decades that laid the foundations for the rapid rise of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as providing momentum for mRNA vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 represents an ideal case study allowing to compare design-activity differences between the different mRNA vaccine candidates. Therefore, a detailed overview of the composition and (pre)clinical performance of the three most advanced mRNA vaccines is provided and the influence of choices in their structural design on to their immunogenicity and reactogenicity profile is discussed in depth. In addition to the new fundamental insights in the mRNA vaccines' mode of action highlighted here, we also point out which unknowns remain that require further investigation and possibly, optimization in future mRNA vaccine development."
