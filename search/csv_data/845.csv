8440,A Tale of Two Crises: Addressing Covid-19 Vaccine Hesitancy as Promoting Racial Justice.,"The year 2020 has yielded twin crises in the United States: a global pandemic and a public reckoning with racism brought about by a series of publicized instances of police violence toward Black men and women. Current data indicate that nationally, Black Americans are three times more likely than White Americans to contract Covid-19 (with further variance by state), a pattern that underscores the more general phenomenon of health disparity among Black and White Americans (Oppel et al. in The New York Times 2020; APM Research Lab Staff in APM Research Lab 2020). Once exposed, Black Americans are twice as likely to die of the virus. Unsurprisingly, Black Americans report higher levels of fear of Covid-19 than their White peers, but they also report higher levels of hesitancy toward a Covid-19 vaccine. This paper explores why this apparent discrepancy exists. It also provides practical recommendations for how government and public health leaders might address vaccine hesitancy in the context of the twin crises of 2020."
8441,COVID-19: the novel coronavirus disease and its manifestations and management in ophthalmology.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a newly identified acute respiratory disease caused by a strain of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has become a worldwide pandemic. From December 2019 to present, millions of cases have been reported, bringing unprecedented pressure on both health and epidemic prevention services in every country. As frontline healthcare workers, ophthalmologists face an increased threat of viral infection, not only because of close contact with patients during examinations or operations, but also due to evidence showing that ocular fluids such as tears or conjunctival secretions may carry the virus. The risk that healthcare workers face is emphasized by the loss of our colleagues who have sacrificed themselves in combating the virus. As a result, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the threats that we face. In the first part of this review, we start by explaining the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and examining its transmission and means of infection. Next, we summarize the latest scientific advancements of epidemiology, clinical presentations, and current treatments of COVID-19. In the second half of the review, we emphasize the ocular transmission, symptomatic manifestations, and the essential knowledge in an ophthalmology clinic setting. As the pandemic of COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to global health, we hope that this review makes a contribution to combating COVID-19."
8442,Risk for Acquiring Coronavirus Disease Illness among Emergency Medical Service Personnel Exposed to Aerosol-Generating Procedures.,"We investigated the risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)- patients transmitting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to emergency medical service (EMS) providers, stratified by aerosol-generating procedures (AGP), in King County, Washington, USA, during February 16-July 31, 2020. We conducted a retrospective cohort investigation using a statewide COVID-19 registry and identified 1,115 encounters, 182 with â‰¥1 AGP. Overall, COVID-19 incidence among EMS personnel was 0.57 infections/10,000 person-days. Incidence per 10,000 person-days did not differ whether or not infection was attributed to a COVID-19 patient encounter (0.28 vs. 0.59; p>0.05). The 1 case attributed to a COVID-19 patient encounter occurred within an at-risk period and involved an AGP. We observed a very low risk for COVID-19 infection attributable to patient encounters among EMS first responders, supporting clinical strategies that maintain established practices for treating patients in emergency conditions."
8443,V367F Mutation in SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD Emerging during the Early Transmission Phase Enhances Viral Infectivity through Increased Human ACE2 Receptor Binding Affinity.,"The current pandemic of COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether naturally occurring RBD mutations during the early transmission phase have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, we first analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Among 32,123 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (December 2019 through March 2020), 302 nonsynonymous RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 96 mutant types. The six dominant mutations were analyzed applying molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). The mutant type V367F continuously circulating worldwide displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2 due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The MDS also indicated that it would be difficult for bat SARS-like CoV to infect humans. However, the pangolin CoV is potentially infectious to humans. The increased infectivity of V367 mutants was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F+D614G), which may derivate from recombination. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of early SARS-CoV-2 variants of zoonotic origin under negative selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. IMPORTANCE A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused the pandemic of COVID-19. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with zoonotic infections. The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is identified as the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. Thus, whether mutations in the RBD of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates have altered the receptor binding affinity and made them more infectious has been the research hot spot. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, the significance of our research is in identifying and validating the RBD mutant types emerging during the early transmission phase and increasing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding affinity and infectivity. Our study provides insights into the evolutionary trajectory of early SARS-CoV-2 variants of zoonotic origin. The continuing surveillance of RBD mutations with increased human ACE2 affinity in human or other animals is critical to the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines against these variants during the sustained COVID-19 pandemic."
8444,Moderate acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in patients pre- and post-heart transplantation: Experiences from a German Transplant Centre.,"Introduction and objectives: Patients awaiting heart transplantation (HTx) are at increased risk developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients supported by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) face additional risks due to coagulopathies during COVID-19. Following HTx, elevated risk factors for severe COVID-19 persist due to chronic immunosuppression and frequent comorbidities. Taken together, COVID-19 vaccination is of critical importance in all three patient cohorts. Here, we report our experience to deliver COVID-19 vaccination in a German transplant center. Methods and results: We screened 211 patients for contraindications and offered the remaining 186 eligible patients COVID-19 vaccination. Of those, 133 patients (71%) accepted the offer and were vaccinated. Acceptance of vaccination differed between HTx recipients (84 of 113, 74%), patients on the waiting list (34 of 47, 72%), and patients with LVAD support (28 of 50, 56%). The LVAD cohort demonstrated lower acceptance levels for vaccination compared to HTx recipients and patients awaiting HTx (74% vs. 56%; p = 0.028). Conclusion: We demonstrate for the first time only moderate acceptance levels of COVID-19 vaccination in HTx recipients and candidates on the waiting list compared to general population, despite perceived high-risk for severe disease. Additionally, those supported by LVAD have even lower adherence. Efforts may need to be made to increase acceptance in this vulnerable as well as cost-intensive patient cohort."
8445,"Use of Genomics to Track Coronavirus Disease Outbreaks, New Zealand.","Real-time genomic sequencing has played a major role in tracking the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), contributing greatly to disease mitigation strategies. In August 2020, after having eliminated the virus, New Zealand experienced a second outbreak. During that outbreak, New Zealand used genomic sequencing in a primary role, leading to a second elimination of the virus. We generated genomes from 78% of the laboratory-confirmed samples of SARS-CoV-2 from the second outbreak and compared them with the available global genomic data. Genomic sequencing rapidly identified that virus causing the second outbreak in New Zealand belonged to a single cluster, thus resulting from a single introduction. However, successful identification of the origin of this outbreak was impeded by substantial biases and gaps in global sequencing data. Access to a broader and more heterogenous sample of global genomic data would strengthen efforts to locate the source of any new outbreaks."
8446,Genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from patients in Turkey reveals the presence of novel mutations in spike and nsp12 proteins.,"Novel mutations have been emerging in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); consequently, the evolving of more virulent and treatment resistance strains have the potential to increase transmissibility and mortality rates. The characterization of full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes is critical for understanding the origin and transmission pathways of the virus, as well as identifying mutations that affect the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus. We present an analysis of the mutation pattern and clade distribution of full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained from specimens tested at Gazi University Medical Virology Laboratory. Viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal specimens. Next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced on Illumina iSeq 100 platform. Raw sequencing data were processed to obtain full-length genome sequences and variant calling was performed to analyze amino acid changes. Clade distribution was determined to understand the phylogenetic background in relation to global data. A total of 293 distinct mutations were identified, of which 152 missense, 124 synonymous, 12 noncoding, and 5 deletions. The most frequent mutations were P323L (nsp12), D614G (ORF2/S), and 2421C>T (5'-untranslated region) found simultaneously in all sequences. Novel mutations were found in nsp12 (V111A, H133R, Y453C, M626K) and ORF2/S (R995G, V1068L). Nine different Pangolin lineages were detected. The most frequently assigned lineage was B.1.1 (17 sequences), followed by B.1 (7 sequences) and B.1.1.36 (3 sequences). Sequence information is essential for revealing genomic diversity. Mutations might have significant functional implications and analysis of these mutations provides valuable information for therapeutic and vaccine development studies. Our findings point to the introduction of the virus into Turkey through various sources and the subsequent spread of several key variants."
8447,Recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity after COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Present study aimed to estimate the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity after recovery from COVID-19 and to determine the factors associated with recurrent positivity. We searched the PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry for studies published to June 12, 2020. Studies were reviewed to determine the risk of bias. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Fourteen studies of 2568 individuals were included. The incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.44-18.19%). The pooled estimate of the interval from disease onset to recurrence was 35.4 days (95% CI 32.65-38.24 days), and from the last negative to the recurrent positive result was 9.8 days (95% CI 7.31-12.22 days). Patients with younger age and a longer initial illness were more likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while patients with diabetes, severe disease, and a low lymphocyte count were less likely to experience. Present study concluded that the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.8% suggesting further studies must be conducted to elucidate the possibility of infectious individuals with prolonged or recurrent RNA positivity."
8448,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Neurosurgery Residency Action Plan: An Institutional Experience from the United States.,"Background: The current pandemic crisis, caused by a novel human coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), has forced a dramatic change in our society. A key portion of the medical work force on the frontline is composed of resident physicians. Thus, it becomes imperative to create an adequate and effective action plan to restructure this valuable human resource amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. We sought to describe a comprehensive approach taken by a Neurosurgery Department in quaternary care academic institution in the United States of America amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic focused in resident training and support. Objective: To describe a comprehensive approach taken by a Neurosurgery Department in quaternary care academic institution in the United States of America amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic focused on resident training and support. Results: A restructuring of the Neurosurgery Department at our academic institution was performed focused on decreasing their risk of infection/exposure and transmission to others, while minimizing negative consequences in the training experience. An online academic platform was built for resident education, guidance, and support, as well as continue channel for pandemic update by the department leadership. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV2 pandemic constitutes a global health emergency full of uncertainty. Treatment, scope, duration, and economic burden forced a major restructuring of our medical practice. In this regard, academic institutions must direct efforts to diminish further negative impact in the training and education of the upcoming generation of physicians, including those currently in medical school. Perhaps the only silver lining in this terrible disruption will be greater appreciation of the role of current health care providers and educators, whose contributions to our society are often neglected or unrecognized."
