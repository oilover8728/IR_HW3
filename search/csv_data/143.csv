1420,"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence among Healthcare, First Response, and Public Safety Personnel, Detroit Metropolitan Area, Michigan, USA, May-June 2020.","To estimate seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among healthcare, first response, and public safety personnel, antibody testing was conducted in emergency medical service agencies and 27 hospitals in the Detroit, Michigan, USA, metropolitan area during May-June 2020. Of 16,403 participants, 6.9% had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In adjusted analyses, seropositivity was associated with exposure to SARS-CoV-2-positive household members (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.18, 95% CI 4.81-7.93) and working within 15 km of Detroit (aOR 5.60, 95% CI 3.98-7.89). Nurse assistants (aOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.24-2.83) and nurses (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.18-1.95) had higher likelihood of seropositivity than physicians. Working in a hospital emergency department increased the likelihood of seropositivity (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.002-1.35). Consistently using N95 respirators (aOR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.95) and surgical facemasks (aOR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98) decreased the likelihood of seropositivity."
1421,Highly sensitive and specific diagnosis of COVID-19 by reverse transcription multiple cross-displacement amplification-labelled nanoparticles biosensor.,"Background: The ongoing outbreak of the novel human coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (also known as 2019-nCoV) has become a global health concern. Rapid and easy-to-use diagnostic techniques are urgently needed to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We devised a reverse transcription multiple cross-displacement amplification (RT-MCDA) coupled with a nanoparticle-based biosensor assay (RT-MCDA-BS) for rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Two primer sets were designed to target the open reading frame 1a/b and nucleoprotein gene of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 183 clinical samples, including 65 patients with COVID-19 infection and 118 patients with other pathogen infections were used to testify the assay's feasibility. Diagnosis results were reported visually using the biosensor. Findings: The assay designed was performed using a simple instrument which could maintain the reaction in a constant temperature at 64°C for only 35 min. The total COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS test procedure could be finished within 1 h. The COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS could detect down to five copies of target sequences. Among 65 clinical samples from the COVID-19 patients, 22 (33.8%) positive results were obtained from faeces, nasal, pharyngeal and anal swabs via COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS assay, while real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay only detected 20 (30.7%) positive results in these samples. No positive results were obtained from clinical samples with non-COVID-19 infections. Interpretation: COVID-19 RT-MCDA-BS was a rapid, reliable, low-cost and easy-to-use assay, which could provide an attractive laboratory tool to diagnose COVID-19 in multiple clinical specimens, especially for field, clinic laboratories and primary care facilities in resource-poor settings."
1422,Can algae contribute to the war with Covid-19?,"The world at large is facing a new threat with the emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Though imperceptible by the naked eye, the medical, sociological and economical implications caused by this newly discovered virus have been and will continue to be a great impediment to our lives. This health threat has already caused over two million deaths worldwide in the span of a year and its mortality rate is projected to continue rising. In this review, the potential of algae in combating the spread of COVID-19 is investigated since algal compounds have been tested against viruses and algal anti-inflammatory compounds have the potential to treat the severe symptoms of COVID-19. The possible utilization of algae in producing value-added products such as serological test kits, vaccines, and supplements that would either mitigate or hinder the continued health risks caused by the virus is prominent. Many of the characteristics in algae can provide insights on the development of microalgae to fight against SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses and contribute in manufacturing various green and high-value products."

At present, there are many research teams who have adopted different vaccine technology routes to develop 2019-nCoV vaccines. This article reviews and analyzes the current development and research status of 2019-nCoV vaccines in different routes, and explores their possible development in the future."
1427,Pilot study of an occupational healthcare program to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune status of employees in a large pharmaceutical company.,"Objective: To safeguard key workers involved in development and production of medicines and ensure business continuity, we developed an occupational healthcare program, performed by our company's occupational healthcare services, to assess the infection and immune status for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pilot program, conducted at our company facilities, evaluated the suitability of diagnostic tools in our setting for program upscaling. Methods: We used different marketed in vitro diagnostics (including tests for antibodies against spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and nucleocapsid [N] protein) combined with medical history, symptoms and likelihood of infection. We evaluated the testing strategy over four visits in 141 employees (known positive COVID-19 history, n = 20; unknown status, n = 121) between April and June 2020 at four company locations in Germany. Digital self-monitoring over the pilot program duration was also included. Results: No incident infections were detected. Based on immune status, medical history and likelihood of infection, 10 participants (8.3%) with previously unknown history of COVID-19 were identified to have been infected before entering the program. These participants, who recalled no or mild symptoms in the preceding months, were primarily identified using an assay that detected both S1 and S2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G. The frequency of positive lateral flow assay (LFA) results (IgM or IgG directed against the N-protein) in this cohort was lower compared with participants with a known history of COVID-19 (0‒10.8% vs. 33.8‒75.7%, respectively). Conclusions: Data from this pilot program suggest that LFA for antibodies may not always reliably detect current, recent or past infections; consequently, these have not been included in our upscaled occupational healthcare program. Regular testing strategies for viral RNA and antibodies directed against different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, combined with hygiene rules and a comprehensive baseline assessment, are recommended to ensure avoidance of infections at workplace as reliably as possible."
