3020,BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2.,"A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed in quantities that are sufficient to immunize large populations. Here we report the preclinical development of two vaccine candidates (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) that contain nucleoside-modified messenger RNA that encodes immunogens derived from the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, formulated in lipid nanoparticles. BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted trimerized receptor-binding domain (known as the RBD-foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane S glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation by the substitution of two residues with proline (S(K986P/V987P); hereafter, S(P2) (also known as P2 S)). The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind to human ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% of the S(P2) trimers are in the two-RBD 'down', one-RBD 'up' state. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate vaccine elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong T-helper-1 CD4+ and IFNγ+CD8+ T cell responses. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with the BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres that are 8.2-18.2× that of a panel of SARS-CoV-2-convalescent human sera. The vaccine candidates protect macaques against challenge with SARS-CoV-2; in particular, BNT162b2 protects the lower respiratory tract against the presence of viral RNA and shows no evidence of disease enhancement. Both candidates are being evaluated in phase I trials in Germany and the USA1-3, and BNT162b2 is being evaluated in an ongoing global phase II/III trial (NCT04380701 and NCT04368728)."
3021,COVID-19 vaccines: Global challenges and prospects forum recommendations.,"The 11th KAIMRC Annual Research Forum Themed ""COVID-19 Vaccine: Global Challenges and Prospects Forum"" discussed COVID19 Vaccines. The Forum was a vital event as it provided a hub for leading COVID-19 vaccine scientists, regulators, developers, and distributors to learn about COVID-19 vaccines in development, make decisions about the best vaccines to use, and develop appropriate plans for global distribution and pricing. The COVID-19: Global Efforts for Development, Clinical Trials and Distribution Symposium brought together leading scientists, clinicians, pharma, decision makers, academic institutions and businesses to present and discuss the vaccines that are being currently developed for the COVID19. This event was held to shed light on these vaccines as many are at the late stage of Phase III clinical trials and ready to be marketed. This follows the confusion that few vaccines were produced and pushed into phase III without sharing all the necessary data preventing the scientific and clinical community to judge its efficacy and safety. This event allowed a discussion into the challenges in the distribution, pricing and accessibility of the vaccines. Moreover, the symposium discussed the importance to invest in Biotech-Pharma to combat and overcome any future health crisis. The discussion focused on Saudi Arabia leading initiatives as front runner in the field among G20 members."

3025,"Polymerase-chain reaction testing to prevent hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Shinjuku, an epicenter in Tokyo: The Tokyo Women's Medical University model.","Hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a healthcare challenge. We hypothesized that polymerase chain reaction testing of symptomatic triaged outpatients and all inpatients before hospitalization in Shinjuku, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epicenter in Tokyo, using the Tokyo Women's Medical University (TMWU) model would be feasible and efficient at preventing COVID-19. This retrospective study enrolled 2981 patients from March to May 2020. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.81% (95% credible interval [CI]: 0.95-3.47%) in triaged symptomatic outpatients, 0.04% (95% CI: 0.0002-0.2%) in scheduled asymptomatic inpatients, 3.78% (95% CI: 1.82-7.26%) in emergency inpatients, and 2.4% (95% CI: 1.49-3.82%) in symptomatic patients. There were no cases of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. This shows that the TWMU model could prevent hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection and is feasible and effective in reducing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hospitals."
3026,Procedural aspects of COVID-19 vaccinations for seafarers on ocean-going vessels.,"The increasing availability of safe and authorised coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines for the first time provides the opportunity to vaccinate seafarers on board their ships while in port. Speedy vaccination of seafarers secures their health and serves to avoid the international propagation of COVID-19 virus variants via maritime traffic. As a port medical clinic, we will share our practical vaccination experience on board of merchant vessels in German/European ports with our esteemed coastal colleagues to stimulate their participation in this endeavour. You will have to adapt the procedure to your national particularities, otherwise please freely share the information with interested parties. Detailed guidance on COVID-19 vaccination in shipping and accompanying legal issues was published by the International Chamber of Shipping (www.ics-shipping.org)."
3027,Impact of presymptomatic COVID-19 on vascular and skeletal muscle function: a case study.,"The impact of COVID-19 has been largely described after symptom development. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus elevates heart rate (HR) prior to symptom onset, whether this virus evokes other presymptomatic alterations is unknown. This case study details the presymptomatic impact of COVID-19 on vascular and skeletal muscle function in a young woman [24 yr, 173.5 cm, 89 kg, body mass index (BMI): 29.6 kg·m-2]. Vascular and skeletal muscle function were assessed as part of a separate study with the first and second visits separated by 2 wk. On the evening following the second visit, the participant developed a fever and a rapid antigen test confirmed a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Compared with the first visit, the participant presented with a markedly elevated HR (∼30 beats/min) and a lower mean blood pressure (∼8 mmHg) at the second visit. Vascular function measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, reactive hyperemia, and passive leg movement were all noticeably attenuated (25%-65%) as was leg blood flow during knee extension exercise. Muscle strength was diminished as was ADP-stimulated respiration (30%), assessed in vitro, whereas there was a 25% increase in the apparent Km. Lastly, an elevation in IL-10 was observed prior to symptom onset. Notably, 2.5 mo after diagnosis symptoms of fatigue and cough were still present. Together, these findings provide unique insight into the physiological responses immediately prior to onset of COVID-19 symptoms; they suggest that SARS-CoV-2 negatively impacts vascular and skeletal muscle function prior to the onset of common symptoms and may set the stage for the widespread sequelae observed following COVID-19 diagnosis.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This unique case study details the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on vascular and skeletal muscle function in a young predominantly presymptomatic woman. Prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, substantial reductions in vascular, skeletal muscle, and mitochondrial function were observed along with an elevation in IL-10. This integrative case study indicates that the presymptomatic impact of COVID-19 is widespread and may help elucidate the acute and long-term sequelae of this disease."

3029,Kidney transplantation and patients who decline SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: an ethical framework.,"As SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have started to be rolled out, a key question facing transplant units has been whether listing for transplantation should be contingent on recipients having received a vaccine. We aimed to provide an ethical framework when considering potential transplant candidates who decline vaccination. We convened a working group comprising transplant professionals, lay members and patients and undertook a literature review and consensus process. This group's work was also informed by discussions in two hospital clinical ethics committees. We have reviewed arguments for and against mandating vaccination prior to listing for kidney transplantation and considered some practical difficulties which may be associated with a policy of mandated vaccination. Rather than requiring that all patients must receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prior to transplant listing, we recommend considering vaccination status as one of a number of SARS-CoV-2-related risk factors in relation to transplant listing. Transplant units should engage in individualised risk-benefit discussions with patients, avoid the language of mandated treatments and strongly encourage uptake of the vaccine in all patient groups, using tailor-made educational initiatives."
