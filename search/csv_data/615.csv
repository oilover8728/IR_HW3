6140,Infection- and vaccine-induced antibody binding and neutralization of the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant.,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein is raising concerns about the efficacy of infection- or vaccine-induced antibodies. We compared antibody binding and live virus neutralization of sera from naturally infected and Moderna-vaccinated individuals against two SARS-CoV-2 variants: B.1 containing the spike mutation D614G and the emerging B.1.351 variant containing additional spike mutations and deletions. Sera from acutely infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients exhibited a 3-fold reduction in binding antibody titers to the B.1.351 variant receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and a 3.5-fold reduction in neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant compared to the B.1 variant. Similar results were seen with sera from Moderna-vaccinated individuals. Despite reduced antibody titers against the B.1.351 variant, sera from infected and vaccinated individuals containing polyclonal antibodies to the spike protein could still neutralize SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351, suggesting that protective humoral immunity may be retained against this variant."
6141,Noncanonical crRNAs derived from host transcripts enable multiplexable RNA detection by Cas9.,"CRISPR-Cas systems recognize foreign genetic material using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs). In type II systems, a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) hybridizes to crRNAs to drive their processing and utilization by Cas9. While analyzing Cas9-RNA complexes from Campylobacter jejuni, we discovered tracrRNA hybridizing to cellular RNAs, leading to formation of ""noncanonical"" crRNAs capable of guiding DNA targeting by Cas9. Our discovery inspired the engineering of reprogrammed tracrRNAs that link the presence of any RNA of interest to DNA targeting with different Cas9 orthologs. This capability became the basis for a multiplexable diagnostic platform termed LEOPARD (leveraging engineered tracrRNAs and on-target DNAs for parallel RNA detection). LEOPARD allowed simultaneous detection of RNAs from different viruses in one test and distinguished severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its D614G (Asp614→Gly) variant with single-base resolution in patient samples."
6142,Thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination: a single UK centre experience.,"We report clinical findings of three patients presenting with thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia 10-16 days following the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. All patients presented to a major university teaching hospital in the UK over a 5-day period and were found to have high-titre antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) without previous exposure to heparin. All three patients presented with extensive venous thrombosis, significant thrombocytopaenia, elevated D-dimer and borderline low fibrinogen. Two had fatal intracerebral haemorrhage secondary to cavernous venous sinus thrombosis and one had PE. Reference laboratory testing of serum demonstrated anti-PF4 antibodies in all three patients. The clinical and laboratory findings confirmed vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopaenia (VITT) which was poorly described at the time of presentation. We were able to manage successfully one patient with PE with intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids."
6143,Anaphylaxis is a rare reaction in COVID-19 vaccination.,"Anaphylaxis is a severe multisystem reaction that occurs rapidly after the introduction of an antigen that would otherwise be a harmless substance. It is characterized by airway and respiratory problems, cardiovascular collapse, mucosal inflammation, and other complications, all severe symptoms that can cause death. IgE-dependent anaphylaxis involves mast cells (MCs) which are the main sources of biologically active mediators that contribute to the pathological and lethal phenomena that can occur in anaphylaxis. Antibody-mediated anaphylaxis can follow multiple pathways such as that mediated by MCs carrying the FcεRI receptor, which can be activated by very small amounts of antigen including a vaccine antigen and trigger an anaphylactic reaction. In addition, anaphylaxis can also be provoked by high concentrations of IgG antibodies that bind to the FcγR receptor present on basophils, neutrophils, macrophages and MCs. For this reason, the IgG concentration should be kept under control in vaccinations. Activation of MCs is a major cause of anaphylaxis, which requires immediate treatment with epinephrine to arrest severe lethal symptoms. MCs are activated through the antigen binding and cross-linking of IgE with release of mediators such as histamine, proteases, prostaglandins, leukotrienes and inflammatory cytokines. The release of these compounds causes nausea, vomiting, hives, wheezing, flushing, tachycardia, hypotension, laryngeal edema, and cardiovascular collapse. mRNA and viral vector vaccines have been cleared by the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generating hope of prevention and cure for COVID-19 around the world. Scientists advise against giving the vaccine to individuals who have had a previous history of anaphylaxis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises people with a previous history of any immediate allergic reaction to remain under observation for approximately 30 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. To date, vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection have not raised major concerns of severe allergic reactions, although, in some cases, pain and redness at the injection site and fever have occurred after administration of the vaccine. These reactions occur in the first 24-48 hours after vaccination. It has been reported that probable forms of anaphylaxis could also occur, especially in women approximately 40 years of age. But after tens of millions of vaccinations, only a few patients had this severe reaction with a low incidence. Anaphylactic and severe allergic reactions can also occur to any component of the vaccine including polysorbates and polyethylene glycol. To date, there is no precise information on allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Individuals with MCs and complement with higher activation than others may be at greater allergic risk. Moreover, the reactions called anaphylactoids, are those not mediated by IgE because they do not involve this antibody and can also occur in COVID-19 vaccination. These not-IgE-mediated reactions occur through direct activation of MCs and complement with tryptase production, but to a lesser extent than IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. However, at the moment it is not known exactly which component of the vaccine causes the allergic reaction and which vaccine causes the most side effects, including anaphylaxis. Thus, individuals who have a known allergy to any component of the vaccine should not be vaccinated. However, should an anaphylactic reaction occur, this requires immediate treatment with epinephrine to arrest severe lethal symptoms. In conclusion, the purpose of this editorial is to encourage the population to be vaccinated in order to extinguish this global pandemic that is afflicting the world population, and to reassure individuals that anaphylactic reactions do not occur with a higher incidence than other vaccinations."
6144,"A Systematic Framework to Rapidly Obtain Data on Patients with Cancer and COVID-19: CCC19 Governance, Protocol, and Quality Assurance.","When the COVID-19 pandemic began, formal frameworks to collect data about affected patients were lacking. The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) was formed to collect granular data on patients with cancer and COVID-19 at scale and as rapidly as possible. CCC19 has grown from five initial institutions to 125 institutions with >400 collaborators. More than 5,000 cases with complete baseline data have been accrued. Future directions include increased electronic health record integration for direct data ingestion, expansion to additional domestic and international sites, more intentional patient involvement, and granular analyses of still-unanswered questions related to cancer subtypes and treatments."
6145,Low COVID-19 vaccination coverage and high COVID-19 mortality rates in Brazilian elderly.,"Objective: To investigate the relation between COVID-19 vaccine coverage and COVID-19-related mortality by age groups in Brazil in 2021. Methods: Secondary data on COVID-19 deaths and vaccination coverage were retrieved to investigate COVID-19 mortality rate (MR) evolution as the vaccination against COVID-19 advanced in Brazil in 2021. Poisson regression with adjustment for age and Brazilian states was used to calculate the MR. Results: By mid-April 2021, MR increased 2 - 3 times compared with the already high level in January for people aged 60 years or older, reaching the highest epidemic level of 5 - 15 per 100,000 inhabitants in this age group. Despite the following decline trend, by the end of May, the MR level was still about 50% and 80% higher for the age groups of 40 - 79 years and 80 years or older. The coverage concerning the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine reached 80% for people aged 60 - 69 years and exceeded 95% for those aged 70 years or older, but the second dose was only given to 26, 76 and 64% of the age groups of 60 - 69, 70 - 79, and 80 years or older, respectively. The age-standardized average MR over the study period was the highest in northern Brazilian states of Rondônia, Amazonas, Acre, and Roraima (range 6-8.4 per 100,000 inhabitants). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination coverage was below the level necessary to protect Brazilians from rising MR between January and May 2021. Urgent measures are necessary to increase the vaccine supply and the adherence to non-pharmacological protective measures."
6146,Intranasal vaccination with a lentiviral vector protects against SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical animal models.,"To develop a vaccine candidate against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we generated a lentiviral vector (LV) eliciting neutralizing antibodies against the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Systemic vaccination by this vector in mice, in which the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2 has been induced by transduction of respiratory tract cells by an adenoviral vector, confers only partial protection despite high levels of serum neutralizing activity. However, eliciting an immune response in the respiratory tract through an intranasal boost results in a >3 log10 decrease in the lung viral loads and reduces local inflammation. Moreover, both integrative and non-integrative LV platforms display strong vaccine efficacy and inhibit lung deleterious injury in golden hamsters, which are naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication and closely mirror human COVID-19 physiopathology. Our results provide evidence of marked prophylactic effects of LV-based vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and designate intranasal immunization as a powerful approach against COVID-19."
6147,An understanding of discordant SARS-CoV-2 test results: an examination of the data from a central Auckland laboratory.,"Aim: The diagnostic sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has not been determined. This has led to a degree of uncertainty in the interpretation of results, particularly in patients tested repeatedly. The aim of this study was to explore the characteristics of patients who initially tested negative, and subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This retrospective observational study utilised data from the LabPlus Virology laboratory, Auckland City Hospital, to identify cases (hospital and community) with initial negative and subsequent positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results. Their clinical and laboratory characteristics were summarised. Results: From 1 February to 13 April a total of 20,089 samples were received for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of 2,011 samples from patients with multiple tests, 25 samples were positive. Nine samples were from patients who initially tested negative then tested positive. Reasons for the initial negative test results, which were all from upper respiratory tract samples, included pre-symptomatic presentation or late presentation. All patients had significant risk factors and ongoing or evolving symptoms, which warranted repeat testing. Conclusion: Few patients had discordant test results for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. For patients who have a significant risk factor and a negative test result, repeat testing should be performed."

6149,Alaska pharmacists: First responders to the pandemic in the last frontier.,"Background: Pharmacists are among the nation's most accessible and underused health professionals. Within their scope of practice, pharmacists can prescribe and administer vaccines, conduct point-of-care testing, and address drug shortages through therapeutic substitutions. Objectives: To better use pharmacists as first responders to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we conducted a needs and capacity assessment to (1) determine individual commitment to provide COVID-19 testing and management services, (2) identify resources required to provide these services, and (3) help prioritize unmet community needs that could be addressed by pharmacists. Methods: In March 2020, pharmacists and student pharmacists within the Alaska Pharmacist Association worked to tailor, administer, and evaluate results from a 10-question survey, including demographics (respondent name, ZIP Code, cell phone, and alternate e-mail). The survey was developed on the basis of published COVID-19 guidelines, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 screening and management guidelines, National Association of Boards of Pharmacy guidance, and joint policy recommendation from pharmacy organizations. Results: Pharmacies are located in the areas of greatest COVID-19 need in Alaska. Pharmacists are willing and interested in providing support. Approximately 63% of the pharmacists who completed the survey indicated that they were interested in providing COVID-19 nasal testing, 60% were interested in conducting COVID-19 antibody testing, and 93% were interested in prescribing and administering immunizations for COVID-19, as available. When asked about resources needed to enable pharmacists to prescribe antiviral therapy, 37% of the pharmacists indicated they needed additional education or training, and 39% required access to technology to bill and document provided services. Conclusion: The primary barrier to pharmacists augmenting the current COVID-19 response is an inability to cover the costs of providing these health services. Pharmacists in Alaska are ready to meet COVID-19-related clinical needs if public and private insurers and legislators can help address the barriers to service sustainability."
