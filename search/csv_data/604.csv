6031,[Does methotrexate influence the efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2?].,"The question whether an ongoing treatment with methotrexate (MTX) actually impairs the protective immune response after SARS-CoV‑2 vaccination cannot be answered with certainty on the basis of the available data. However, in view of the fact that a short discontinuation (once or twice) of the weekly MTX treatment in patients with a stable disease situation is probably associated with a comparatively low risk of inducing a flare of the underlying inflammatory rheumatic disease, such a short discontinuation of treatment can be considered according to the individual decision involving the patient and the treating rheumatologist. Nevertheless, discontinuation of MTX treatment does not appear to be absolutely necessary-especially since discontinuation would have to occur twice within a short period of time for most COVID-19 vaccines. Under no circumstances should longer periods of discontinuation of treatment be considered as this could result in a flare of the underlying disease. A more detailed assessment of the data situation and the resulting consequences (also with respect to DMARD) will follow soon in the updated recommendations for action of the German Society for Rheumatology (DGRh) on the management of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases in the context of the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic, especially COVID-19."
6032,Diagnosis and Management of Vaccine-Related Thrombosis following AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccination: Guidance Statement from the GTH.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global healthcare crisis. Based on reports of atypically located thromboses following vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, the Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research (GTH) has issued guidance statements on the recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of this rare complication. It shares pathophysiological features with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is referred to as vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT)."
6033,Health inequities in COVID-19 vaccination among the elderly: Case of Connecticut.,"Background: In the United States, distribution plans for the COVID-19 vaccination were established at the state level. However, some states, such as Connecticut, followed an age-based strategy without considering occupations or co-morbid conditions due to its simplicity in implementation. This strategy raised concerns about exacerbating health inequities because it did not prioritize vulnerable communities, specifically, minorities and low-income groups. The study aims to examine the vaccination inequities among different population groups for people aged 65+. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of quantile-based independent sample t-test was employed to examine the relationship between eight social vulnerability indices (SVIs, i.e., below poverty, unemployed, without high school diploma, disability, minority, speaks English less than well, no vehicle, and mobile homes) and vaccination rates at the town level in Connecticut during the second phase of the vaccine distribution plan when individuals aged 65 and over were eligible. Negative binomial regressions were employed to further justify the relationships between SVIs and vaccination rates. Results: The report shows that the differences in vaccination rates were statistically significant between the most vulnerable and the least vulnerable towns with respect to six SVIs (i.e., below poverty, without high school diploma, disability, minority, speaks English less than well, and no vehicle). The vaccination gap was greater for people aged 75+ than people aged 65-74. Among the selected SVIs, below poverty was negatively correlated with the vaccination rate for 75+, and without high school diploma was negatively correlated with both rates. Conclusions: This report reveals the significant health inequities in COVID-19 vaccination among the elderly population at the early vaccination phase. It can shed insights into health policy initiatives to improve vaccination coverage in the elderly communities, such as promoting onsite scheduling and increasing at-home vaccination services."

6037,Rapid detection of fast innovation under the pressure of COVID-19.,"Covid-19 has rapidly redefined the agenda of technological research and development both for academics and practitioners. If the medical scientific publication system has promptly reacted to this new situation, other domains, particularly in new technologies, struggle to map what is happening in their contexts. The pandemic has created the need for a rapid detection of technological convergence phenomena, but at the same time it has made clear that this task is impossible on the basis of traditional patent and publication indicators. This paper presents a novel methodology to perform a rapid detection of the fast technological convergence phenomenon that is occurring under the pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic. The fast detection has been performed thanks to the use of a novel source: the online blogging platform Medium. We demonstrate that the hybrid structure of this social journalism platform allows a rapid detection of innovation phenomena, unlike other traditional sources. The technological convergence phenomenon has been modelled through a network-based approach, analysing the differences of networks computed during two time periods (pre and post COVID-19). The results led us to discuss the repurposing of technologies regarding ""Remote Control"", ""Remote Working"", ""Health"" and ""Remote Learning""."
6038,Drive-Through Screening Center for COVID-19: a Safe and Efficient Screening System against Massive Community Outbreak.,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is ongoing, the number of individuals to be tested for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing. For safe and efficient screening for COVID-19, drive-through (DT) screening centers have been designed and implemented in Korea. Herein, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 DT screening centers. The steps of the DT centers include registration, examination, specimen collection, and instructions. The entire service takes about 10 minutes for one testee without leaving his or her cars. Increased testing capacity over 100 tests per day and prevention of cross-infection between testees in the waiting space are the major advantages, while protection of staff from the outdoor atmosphere is challenging. It could be implemented in other countries to cope with the global COVID-19 outbreak and transformed according to their own situations."
6039,Immunogenicity of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in patients with inborn errors of immunity.,"Background: In mid-December 2020, Israel started a nationwide mass vaccination campaign against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the first few weeks, medical personnel, elderly citizens, and patients with chronic diseases were prioritized. As such, patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies were encouraged to receive the vaccine. Although the efficacy of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines has been demonstrated in the general population, little is known about their efficacy and safety in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI). Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response to COVID-19 vaccine in a cohort of patients with IEI. Methods: A total of 26 adult patients were enrolled, and plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from them 2 weeks following the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Humoral response was evaluated by testing anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor-binding domain and antinucleocapsid antibody titers and evaluating neutralizing ability by inhibition of receptor-binding domain-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding. Cellular immune response was evaluated by using ELISpot, estimating IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion in response to pooled SARS-CoV-2 S- or M-peptides. Results: Our cohort included 18 patients with a predominantly antibody deficiency, 2 with combined immunodeficiency, 3 with immune dysregulation, and 3 with other genetically defined diagnoses. Twenty-two of them were receiving immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Of the 26 patients, 18 developed specific antibody response, and 19 showed S-peptide-specific T-cell response. None of the patients reported significant adverse events. Conclusion: Vaccinating patients with IEI is safe, and most patients were able to develop vaccine-specific antibody response, S-protein-specific cellular response, or both."
