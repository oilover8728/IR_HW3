3880,Saliva as a Potential Diagnostic Specimen for COVID-19 Testing.,"The current outbreak of the highly contagious, animal origin SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the disease COVID-19. The disease is globally pandemic and as per World Health Organization (WHO) has spread to 235 countries. There is global lockdown for containment of the virus transmission. Testing of symptomatic patients, healthcare workers and suspected individuals and mass screening is vital. WHO recommends nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab for the quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA level through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The virus is shown to be consistently present in saliva and rRTPCR of saliva specimens and have advantages over NP and OP swabs such as self-collection of saliva, avoidance of healthcare workers for specimen collection, cost-effectiveness, etc. This article explores the current literature and suggests saliva as an emerging potential diagnostic specimen for COVID-19 testing."

3882,"Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (Sf9 cells) in healthy population aged 18 years or older: two single-center, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and phase 2 trials.","COVID-19 vaccines from multiple manufacturers are needed to cope with the problem of insufficient supply. We did two single-center, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 and phase 2 trials to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (Sf9 cells) in healthy population aged 18 years or older in China. Eligible participants were enrolled, the ratio of candidate vaccine and placebo within each dose group was 3:1 (phase 1) or 5:1 (phase 2). From August 28, 2020, 168 participants were sequentially enrolled and randomly assigned to receive the low dose vaccine, high dose vaccine or placebo with the schedule of 0, 28 days or 0, 14, 28 days in phase 1 trial. From November 18, 2020, 960 participants were randomly assigned to receive the low dose vaccine, high dose vaccine or placebo with the schedule of 0, 21 days or 0, 14, 28 days in phase 2 trial. The most common solicited injection site adverse reaction within 7 days in both trials was pain. The most common solicited systematic adverse reactions within 7 days were fatigue, cough, sore throat, fever and headache. ELISA antibodies and neutralising antibodies increased at 14 days, and peaked at 28 days (phase 1) or 30 days (phase 2) after the last dose vaccination. The GMTs of neutralising antibody against live SARS-CoV-2 at 28 days or 30 days after the last dose vaccination were highest in the adult high dose group (0, 14, 28 days), with 102.9 (95% CI 61.9-171.2) and 102.6 (95% CI 75.2-140.1) in phase 1 and phase 2 trials, respectively. Specific T-cell response peaked at 14 days after the last dose vaccination in phase 1 trial. This vaccine is safe, and induced significant immune responses after three doses of vaccination."
3883,"Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay-Based Infection Control Strategies for COVID-19 in a Hospital Under the State of Emergency in Tokyo, Japan in Spring 2020.","Studies describing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay-based infection control strategies (LAMP-based ICSs) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited. We reviewed the medical records of cases in which RT-LAMP was performed. Standard ICSs and LAMP-based ICSs were implemented during the study period. The strategies were intended to impose longer periods of infection control precautions (ICPs) for specific patients, such as those with a history of exposure to COVID-19 patients and/or bilateral ground glass opacities (bGGO) on chest computed tomography (CT). Of 212 patients, which included 13 confirmed COVID-19 patients in the diagnostic cohort, exposure to COVID-19 patients (P <0.0001) and chest CT bGGO (P = 0.0022) were identified as significant predictors of COVID-19. In the 173 hospitalized patients in which the results of the first RT-LAMP were negative, the duration of ICPs was significantly longer in patients with exposure to COVID-19 and/or a high clinical index of suspicion and patients with bGGO than in the remaining patients (P = 0.00046 and P = 0.0067, respectively). Additionally, no confirmed COVID-19 cases indicating nosocomial spread occurred during the study period. Establishing a comprehensive system that combines rational LAMP-based ICSs with standard ICSs might be useful for preventing nosocomial spread."
3884,"Spatial Inequities in COVID-19 Testing, Positivity, Confirmed Cases, and Mortality in 3 U.S. Cities : An Ecological Study.","Background: Preliminary evidence has shown inequities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cases and deaths in the United States. Objective: To explore the emergence of spatial inequities in COVID-19 testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Design: Ecological, observational study at the ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) level from March to September 2020. Setting: Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia. Participants: All populated ZCTAs in the 3 cities. Measurements: Outcomes were ZCTA-level COVID-19 testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality cumulatively through the end of September 2020. Predictors were the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index and its 4 domains, obtained from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. The spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 outcomes was examined by using global and local Moran I statistics, and estimated associations were examined by using spatial conditional autoregressive negative binomial models. Results: Spatial clusters of high and low positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality were found, co-located with clusters of low and high social vulnerability in the 3 cities. Evidence was also found for spatial inequities in testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality. Specifically, neighborhoods with higher social vulnerability had lower testing rates and higher positivity ratios, confirmed case rates, and mortality rates. Limitations: The ZCTAs are imperfect and heterogeneous geographic units of analysis. Surveillance data were used, which may be incomplete. Conclusion: Spatial inequities exist in COVID-19 testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality in 3 large U.S. cities. Primary funding source: National Institutes of Health."
3885,COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance among College Students: A Theory-Based Analysis.,"The severity and pervasiveness of the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines. Three vaccines have been approved in the United States (USA). However, there is still some hesitancy in COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among some subgroups, including college students. While research is limited on vaccine acceptability behavior among college students, preliminary data suggests hesitancy as being high. This study aimed to explain the correlates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among college students who reported hesitancy toward the COVID-19 vaccine and those who did not using the initiation component of the multi-theory model (MTM) of health behavior change. Using a cross-sectional study design, data were collected from a Southern USA University (n = 282) utilizing a valid and reliable 27-item questionnaire in February and March 2021. Almost half (47.5%) of participants reported hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The three constructs of MTM's initiation model, behavioral confidence (b = 0.089, p < 0.001), participatory dialogue (b = 0.056, p < 0.001), and changes in the physical environment (b = 0.066, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among those who were not hesitant to take the vaccine and accounted for 54.8% of the variance. Among those who were hesitant to take the COVID-19 vaccine, the MTM construct of behavioral confidence (b = 0.022, p < 0.001) was significant along with Republican Party political affiliation (b = -0.464, p = 0.004), which was negatively associated with vaccine acceptance. The model accounted for 60.6% of the variance in intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. This study provides evidence for the utility of MTM as a timely intervention to design messages for college students to enhance COVID-19 vaccine acceptability."

3887,Electroencephalographic findings among inpatients with COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital from a middle-income country.,"Background: In 2019, the world witnessed the emergence of a new type of coronavirus - the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is variable, and amongst its manifestations are neurological implications. Objective: This report aimed to describe electroencephalographic findings in COVID-19 patients from a general tertiary hospital in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Methods: It was a retrospective, observational, and non-interventional study. Data were collected anonymously, comprising inpatients from Mar 1 to Jun 30, 2020, either confirmed (positive RT-PCR) or probable cases (CO-RADS 4/5) who had performed EEG during hospitalization. Results: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled, 17 (60.7%) women and 11 men, with a median age of 58 (minimum and maximum: 18-86; IQR 23.5). COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed in 22 (78.5%). Twenty-one patients (75%) had severe disease, requiring mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 16 (57.1%) patients developed adjunct sepsis throughout hospitalization. There was no specific pattern found for COVID-19 in EEG. No patients presented with status epilepticus or electrographic events; most patients developed an encephalopathic pattern, as seen in most studies, with a high prevalence of altered mental status as an indication for EEG. Adjunct sepsis was associated with higher mortality. Conclusions: EEG presents as a useful tool in the context of COVID-19, as in other conditions, to differentiate nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) from encephalopathy and other causes of mental status alterations. Further studies are required to analyze whether there might be a specific EEG pattern to the disease."
3888,DNA-launched RNA replicon vaccines induce potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in mice.,"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its rapid spread into a global pandemic made the urgent development of scalable vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global health and economic imperative. Here, we characterized and compared the immunogenicity of two alphavirus-based DNA-launched self-replicating (DREP) vaccine candidates encoding either SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (DREP-S) or a spike ectodomain trimer stabilized in prefusion conformation (DREP-Secto). We observed that the two DREP constructs were immunogenic in mice inducing both binding and neutralizing antibodies as well as T cell responses. Interestingly, the DREP coding for the unmodified spike turned out to be more potent vaccine candidate, eliciting high titers of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies that were able to efficiently neutralize pseudotyped virus after a single immunization. In addition, both DREP constructs were able to efficiently prime responses that could be boosted with a heterologous spike protein immunization. These data provide important novel insights into SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design using a rapid response DNA vaccine platform. Moreover, they encourage the use of mixed vaccine modalities as a strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2."
3889,New Insight into Laboratory Tests and Imaging Modalities for Fast and Accurate Diagnosis of COVID-19: Alternative Suggestions for Routine RT-PCR and CT-A Literature Review.,"The globally inimitable and unremitting outbreak of COVID-19 infection confirmed the emergency need for critical detection of human coronavirus infections. Laboratory diagnostic tests and imaging modalities are two test groups used for the detection of COVID-19. Nowadays, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and computed tomography (CT) have been frequently utilized in the clinic. Some limitations that confront with these tests are false-negative results, tests redone for follow-up procedure, high cost, and unable to do for all patients. To overcome these limitations, modified and alternative tests must be considered. Among these tests, RdRp/Hel RT-PCR assay had the lowest diagnostic limitation and highest sensitivity and specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both respiratory tract and nonrespiratory tract clinical specimens. On the other hand, lung ultrasound (LUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are CT-alternative imaging modalities for the management, screening, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients."
