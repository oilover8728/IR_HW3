3700,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for adolescents and young adult patients treated at a specialist pediatric oncology unit.,"This brief report describes the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program at our pediatric oncology unit. Adopting Italian regulations, patients treated for cancer within the previous 6 months were offered vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine if aged ≥16 years, and with the Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna vaccine if aged ≥18 years. From March 24 to April 28, 2021, 80/89 adolescent and young adult patients enrolled were vaccinated, while nine refused the vaccine due to fear of side effects, disbelief regarding the pandemic, or lack of trust in the scientific community. The refusal rate in our cohort was lower than in the Italian general population."

3704,Medium-term serostatus in Spanish case series recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The medium-term serologic response of SARS-CoV-2 infection recovered individuals is not well known. The aims were to quantify the incidence of seropositive failure in the medium term in a cohort of patients with different COVID-19 severity and to analyze its associated factors. Patients who had recovered from mild and severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an Academic Spanish hospital (March 12-May 2, 2020), were tested for total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test; Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The non-seropositive status (seropositive failure) incidence (95% CI) was determined. Associations were tested by multiple logistic regression in a global cohort and severe pneumonia subpopulation. Of 435 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, a serological test was carried out in 325: 210 (64.6%) had severe pneumonia (hospitalized patients), 51 (15.7%) non-severe pneumonia (managed as outpatients), and 64 (19.7%) mild cases without pneumonia. After a median (IQR) of 76 days (70-83) from symptom onset, antibody responses may not consistently develop or reach levels sufficient to be detectable by antibody tests (non-seropositive incidence) in 6.9% (95% CI, 4.4-10.6) and 20.3% (95% CI, 12.2-31.7) of patients with and without pneumonia, respectively. Baseline independent predictors of seropositive failure were higher leukocytes and fewer days of symptoms before admission, while low glomerular filtrate and fever seem associated with serologic response. Age, comorbidity or immunosuppressive therapies (corticosteroids, tocilizumab) did not influence antibody response. In the medium-term, SARS-CoV-2 seropositive failure is not infrequent in COVID-19 recovered patients. Age, comorbidity or immunosuppressive therapies did not influence antibody response."
3705,Why continuing uncertainties are no reason to postpone challenge trials for coronavirus vaccines.,"To counter the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), some have proposed accelerating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development through controlled human infection (or 'challenge') trials. These trials would involve the deliberate exposure of relatively few young, healthy volunteers to SARS-CoV-2. We defend this proposal against the charge that there is still too much uncertainty surrounding the risks of COVID-19 to responsibly run such a trial."
3706,Disease control as an optimization problem.,"In the context of epidemiology, policies for disease control are often devised through a mixture of intuition and brute-force, whereby the set of logically conceivable policies is narrowed down to a small family described by a few parameters, following which linearization or grid search is used to identify the optimal policy within the set. This scheme runs the risk of leaving out more complex (and perhaps counter-intuitive) policies for disease control that could tackle the disease more efficiently. In this article, we use techniques from convex optimization theory and machine learning to conduct optimizations over disease policies described by hundreds of parameters. In contrast to past approaches for policy optimization based on control theory, our framework can deal with arbitrary uncertainties on the initial conditions and model parameters controlling the spread of the disease, and stochastic models. In addition, our methods allow for optimization over policies which remain constant over weekly periods, specified by either continuous or discrete (e.g.: lockdown on/off) government measures. We illustrate our approach by minimizing the total time required to eradicate COVID-19 within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model proposed by Kissler et al. (March, 2020)."
3707,Data Sharing Solutions for Biobanks for the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel illness, which is not fully understood. Whether an individual has traveled outside their respective country or never left their community, COVID-19 is a highly contagious illness, which can result in high death rates. Biobanks will play a role in providing tools to examine data from those receiving treatment along with reviewing the current and long treatment outcomes associated with this novel coronavirus disease. A diverse, global network made up of laboratory scientists, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, data science teams, physicians, and so on must have a standardized, collaborative, virtual biobanking solution to share clinical expertise and evidence-based solutions. This virtual biobank must be centrally managed to ensure standardized quality assurance and quality control efforts. Virtual biobanks will eliminate the need to transport samples between two locations for a specific study, minimizing the risk of contamination. It is necessary for virtual biobanks to upload imaging data from those patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Standardized, collected information will be essential in the area of discovery and validation of disease markers as well as novel therapeutic strategies. It is essential for biobanks to collect COVID-19 specimens along with corresponding clinical and demographic data from COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Because COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness, proper collection procedures must be in place to collect respiratory samples for biobanking purposes. A preconfigured purpose-built COVID-19 Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is an efficient tool to seamlessly manage a data sharing network. Data entered into LIMS will be beneficial in designing much needed clinical trials to address any unmet needs to better address clinical treatment and outcomes. The partners or entities associated with the COVID-19 data sharing network will be able to effectively communicate, view data, and images associated with their respective research interest to advance COVID-19 research and data driven, clinical care."
3708,Acute Pancreatitis in a Pregnant Patient With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Background: Pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection are at risk for a variety of COVID-19 complications. Case: We report a case of acute pancreatitis in a pregnant patient hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. Comprehensive evaluation ruled out other etiologies of acute pancreatitis. Preterm labor developed at 33 5/7 weeks of gestation, and the patient delivered a liveborn male neonate; neonatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening was negative. The patient improved significantly postpartum and was discharged home on postpartum day 3. Conclusion: Coronavirus disease 2019 may present in pregnancy with a myriad of clinical symptoms other than respiratory. Acute pancreatitis represents an infrequent complication of primary COVID-19 infection."
