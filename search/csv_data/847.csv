8460,"Diabetes and COVID-19: The past, the present, and the future.","Diabetes, one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world, is strongly associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Scrupulous blood sugar management is crucial, since the worse outcomes are closely associated with higher blood sugar levels in COVID-19 infection. Although recent observational studies showed that insulin was associated with mortality, it should not deter insulin use in hospitalized patients requiring tight glucose control. Back and forth dilemma in the past with regards to continue/discontinue certain medications used in diabetes have been mostly resolved. The initial fears of consequences related to continuing certain medications have been largely dispelled. COVID-19 also necessitates the transformation in diabetes care through the integration of technologies. Recent advances in health-related technologies, notably telemedicine and remote continuous glucose monitoring, have become essential in the management of diabetes during the pandemic. Today, these technologies have changed the landscape of medicine and become more important than ever. Being a high-risk population, patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, should be prioritized for vaccination. In the future, as the pandemic fades, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is expected to rise due to lifestyle changes and medical issues/dilemma encountered during the pandemic."
8461,Phylogenomics reveals multiple introductions and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 into Peru.,"Peru has become one of the countries with the highest mortality rates from the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To investigate early transmission events and the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in Peru in the early COVID-19 pandemic, we analyzed 3472 viral genomes, of which 149 were from Peru. Phylogenomic analysis revealed multiple and independent introductions of the virus likely from Europe and Asia and a high diversity of genetic lineages circulating in Peru. In addition, we found evidence for community-driven transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by clusters of related viruses found in patients living in different regions of Peru."
8462,Addressing the Importance of Stem Cell-Based Therapy: A Perspective in the Treatment of COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an extremely pathogenic virus belonging to the family of Coronaviridae. First identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 after an epidemiological investigation of an emerging cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology, SARS-CoV-2 was declared the cause of a pandemic on March 11 by the World Health Organization (WHO), pointing to the over 118000 cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in over 110 countries. Despite the promising results of drug repositioning studies in the treatment of COVID-19, the evidence of their safety and efficacy remains inconclusive. Cell based therapy has been proven safe and possibly effective in treating multiple lung injuries and diseases, but its potential use in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been yet elucidated. Our aim in this review is to provide an overview of the immunomodulatory effect and the regenerative capacity of stem cells and their secretome in the treatment of many diseases including lung injuries. Those findings may contribute to a better understanding of the potential of stem cell therapy in SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential use in order to find a solution for this healthcare crisis."

8464,Interactions Between Specific Immune Status of Pregnant Women and SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Because it is a new and highly contagious coronavirus, most people, especially pregnant women, lack immunity. It is therefore important to understand the interaction between why pregnant women are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and the specific immune systems of pregnant women. Here, we provide an overview of the changes that occur in the immune system during pregnancy, the activation and response of the immune system in pregnant women with COVID-19, adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19, and the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in this population."
8465,A simple method for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR without the use of a commercial RNA extraction kit.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a pandemic caused by a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. The growing demand for commercial kits used for automated extraction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a key step before rRT-PCR diagnosis, could cause a shortage of stocks that hinders the rapid processing of samples. Although the recommendation is to use automated methods for nucleic acid extraction, alternatives are necessary to replace commercial kits. However, these alternatives should be as reliable as automated methods. This work describes a simple method to detect SARS-CoV-2 from specimens collected in different preservation media. Samples were previously inactivated by heating and precipitating with a PEG/NaCl solution before rRT-PCR assays for Orf1ab, N and S genes. The new method was compared with an automated protocol of nucleic acid extraction. Both procedures showed similar analytical results. Consequently, this simple and inexpensive method is a suitable procedure for laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
8466,First results of investigations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human corneal tissue.,Preliminary investigations of human corneal tissues from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cadaveric donors indicated that no severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is present. Current eye banking guidelines do not recommend any type of routine testing for SARS-CoVâ€‘2 RNA in post-mortem donor tissue. This is partly based on factors that can influence the test results of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
8467,[Potential therapies for COVID-19 cardiovascular complications using artemisinin and its derivatives intervene based on its cardiovascular protection].,"Corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19) has brought untold human sufferings and economic tragedy worldwide. It causes acute myocardial injury and chronic damage of cardiovascular system, which has attracted much attention from researchers. For the immediate strategy for COVID-19, &quot;drug repurposing&quot; is a new opportunity for developing drugs to fight COVID-19. Artemisinin and its derivatives have a wide range of pharmacological activities. Recent studies have shown that artemisinin has clear cardiovascular protective effects. This paper summarizes the research progress on the pathogenesis the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in cardiovascular damage by 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) virus from myocardial cell injury directly by 2019-nCoV virus,viral ligands competitively bind to ACE2 and then reduce the protective effect of ACE2 on cardiovascular disease, &quot;cytokine storm&quot; related myocardial damage, arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death induced by the infection and stress, myocardial injury by hypoxemia, heart damage side effects from COVID-19 drugs and summarizing the cardiovascular protective effects of artemisinin and its derivatives have activities of anti-arrhythmia, anti-myocardial ischemia, anti-atherosclerosis and plaque stabilization. Then analyzed the possible multi-pathway intervention effects of artemisinin-based drugs on multiple complications of COVID-19 based on its specific immunomodulatory effects, protective effects of tissue and organ damage and broad-spectrum antiviral effect, to provide clues for the treatment of cardiovascular complications of COVID-19, and give a new basis for the therapy of COVID-19 through &quot;drug repurposing&quot;."
8468,Analyzing the vast coronavirus literature with CoronaCentral.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a surge in research exploring all aspects of the virus and its effects on human health. The overwhelming publication rate means that researchers are unable to keep abreast of the literature. To ameliorate this, we present the CoronaCentral resource that uses machine learning to process the research literature on SARS-CoV-2 together with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We categorize the literature into useful topics and article types and enable analysis of the contents, pace, and emphasis of research during the crisis with integration of Altmetric data. These topics include therapeutics, disease forecasting, as well as growing areas such as ""long COVID"" and studies of inequality. This resource, available at https://coronacentral.ai, is updated daily."
8469,[Acute cerebrovascular accidents associated with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection (COVID-19)].,"Acute cerebrovascular accidents (ACVIs) associated with COVID-19 coronavirus infection are one of the most talked about problems in the medical community. To date, the true incidence of stroke in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. So far, the published literature has been limited to case reports, case series, and observational cohort studies. The article analyzes possible risk factors, especially the age of patients, pathogenetic and clinical correlations of ACVA and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). A clinical case of an 82-year-old patient with ischemic stroke and COVID-19 infection is described."
