8400,Development of ciclesonide analogues that block SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication.,"Ciclesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid used to treat asthma and is currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An active metabolite of ciclesonide, Cic2, was recently reported to repress severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomic RNA replication. Herein, we designed and synthesized a few types of ciclesonide analogues. Cic4 (bearing an azide group) and Cic6 (bearing a chloro group) potently decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and had low cytotoxicity compared with Cic2 (bearing a hydroxy group). These compounds are promising as novel therapeutic agents for COVID-19 that show significant antiviral activity."
8401,Understanding the Clinical Features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 From the Perspective of Aging: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Problems: An outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) infection is now widespread in multiple countries. Compared with adult patients, elderly patients have not received enough attention. The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the clinical characteristics of elder patients with COVID-19. Methods: A deep literature search was performed in the databases through August 21, 2020. Risk ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using analysis models. Results: Three studies including 2046 infected patients were precisely evaluated, and the results show that the elderly group has a higher risk of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than the younger patients. Their total white blood cells are higher than that of the younger patients, and their lymphocytes are relatively reduced compared with the younger patients. Conclusion: We comprehensively assessed the clinical characteristics of patients of different ages with COVID-19 and found that elder patients had a high risk of chronic cardiovascular and metabolism comorbidities. The characteristic clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations of elderly patients support their excessive inflammation and weak immune defenses against 2019-nCoV. All these findings provide important information for understanding the general clinical characterization of the aging immune defense against the virus and enhancing the public awareness of the prevention and treatment of elder patients in the COVID-19 pandemic."

8405,Could BCG Vaccination Induce Protective Trained Immunity for SARS-CoV-2?,"Trained immunity is a type of non-specific memory-like immune response induced by some pathogens and vaccines, such as BCG, which can confer antigen-independent protection against a wide variety of pathogens. The BCG vaccine has been extensively used to protect against tuberculosis for almost a 100 years. Interestingly, this vaccine reduces children's mortality caused by infections unrelated to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, a phenomenon thought to be due to the induction of trained immunity. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected, as of April 22, 2020, 2,623,231 people globally, causing a major public health problem worldwide. Currently, no vaccine or treatment is available to control this pandemic. We analyzed the number of positive cases and deaths in different countries and correlated them with the inclusion of BCG vaccination at birth in their national vaccination programs. Interestingly, those countries where BCG vaccination is given at birth have shown a lower contagion rate and fewer COVID-19-related deaths, suggesting that this vaccine may induce trained immunity that could confer some protection for SARS-CoV-2."

8407,Electrostatic features for nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.,"COVID-19 is increasingly affecting human health and global economy. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly demanded to develop treatments for COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 92.06% identity in their N protein RBDs' sequences, which results in very similar structures. However, the SARS-CoV-2 is more easily to spread. Utilizing multi-scale computational approaches, this work studied the fundamental mechanisms of the nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, including their stabilities and binding strengths with RNAs at different pH values. Electrostatic potential on the surfaces of N proteins show that both the N proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have dominantly positive potential to attract RNAs. The binding forces between SARS-CoV N protein and RNAs at different distances are similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, both in directions and magnitudes. The electric filed lines between N proteins and RNAs are also similar for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The folding energy and binding energy dependence on pH revealed that the best environment for N proteins to perform their functions with RNAs is the weak acidic environment."
8408,"Parental psychological distress and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination: A cross-sectional survey in Shenzhen, China.","Background: Parental attitudes towards the vaccines play a key role in the success of the herd immunity for the COVID-19. Psychological health seems to be a controversial determinant of vaccine hesitancy and remains to be investigated. This study attempted to measure parental psychological distress, attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and to explore the potential associations. Methods: An online survey using convenience sampling method was conducted among parents within the school public health network of Shenzhen. Demographic information and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination were collected. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) was applied to measure psychological distress. Results: Overall, 4,748 parents were included (average age: 40.28, standard deviation: 5.08). More than one fifth of them demonstrated psychological distress, in which only 3.3% were moderate to severe symptom. The proportions of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for themselves, their spouses, and their children were 25.2%, 26.1%, and 27.3%, respectively. Parents with psychological distress were more likely to suffer vaccine hesitancy for themselves (OR: 1.277, 95%CI: 1.091~1.494), for their spouses (OR:1.276, 95%CI: 1.088~1.496) and children (OR:1.274, 95%CI: 1.092~1.486). These associations tended to be more significant among parents with mild or severe psychological distress. Limitation: Non-random sampling limited the generalization of our findings to all parents. Conclusion: Parents had a low level of psychological distress but relatively high willingness of COVID-19 vaccination when there was no local epidemic but persistent risk of imported cases. Targeted health education and intervention strategies should be provided to people with vaccine hesitancy, especially for those who are susceptible to psychological distress."
8409,G-quadruplex based biosensor: A potential tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection.,"G-quadruplex is a non-canonical nucleic acid structure formed by the folding of guanine rich DNA or RNA. The conformation and function of G-quadruplex are determined by a number of factors, including the number and polarity of nucleotide strands, the type of cations and the binding targets. Recent studies led to the discovery of additional advantageous attributes of G-quadruplex with the potential to be used in novel biosensors, such as improved ligand binding and unique folding properties. G-quadruplex based biosensor can detect various substances, such as metal ions, organic macromolecules, proteins and nucleic acids with improved affinity and specificity compared to standard biosensors. The recently developed G-quadruplex based biosensors include electrochemical and optical biosensors. A novel G-quadruplex based biosensors also show better performance and broader applications in the detection of a wide spectrum of pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 disease. This review highlights the latest developments in the field of G-quadruplex based biosensors, with particular focus on the G-quadruplex sequences and recent applications and the potential of G-quadruplex based biosensors in SARS-CoV-2 detection."
