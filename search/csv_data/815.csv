8140,Possible effects of air temperature on COVID-19 disease severity and transmission rates.,"Currently available data are consistent with increased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication at temperatures encountered in the upper airways (25-33°C when breathing room temperature air, 25°C) compared to those in the lower airways (37°C). One factor that may contribute to more rapid viral growth in the upper airways is the exponential increase in SARS-CoV-2 stability that occurs with reductions in temperature, as measured in vitro. Because SARS-CoV-2 frequently initiates infection in the upper airways before spreading through the body, increased upper airway viral growth early in the disease course may result in more rapid progression of disease and potentially contribute to more severe outcomes. Similarly, higher SARS-CoV-2 viral titer in the upper airways likely supports more efficient transmission. Conversely, the possible significance of air temperature to upper airway viral growth suggests that prolonged delivery of heated air might represent a preventative measure and prophylactic treatment for coronavirus disease 2019."
8141,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in asymptomatic pediatric dental patients.,"Background: Children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are typically asymptomatic but contagious. The authors investigated the positivity rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric dental patients. Methods: The authors reviewed consecutive charts of children younger than 18 years scheduled for elective dental procedures from April 1, 2020, through August 1, 2020. All patients were screened for signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic patients scheduled for dental procedures underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. Sociodemographic characteristics were abstracted, and positivity rates were calculated. Variables for patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative were compared using Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: The sample size was 921. The median age was 6 years, and 50.9% were boys. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 2.3%. Age, insurance status, medical history, and dental diagnosis were comparable in patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative. Positivity rates were statistically higher for Hispanic or Latinx patients than other groups (P = .038). Conclusions: Although the yield of testing was low, the systematic evaluation of asymptomatic pediatric dental cases via PCR resulted in the identification of SARS-CoV-2 carriers who could have been infectious. In this study, Hispanics or Latinx had a higher positivity rate than other demographic groups. Practical implications: PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 of asymptomatic patients in pediatric dentistry adds value to the use of screening questionnaires for the identification of infected people who could be contagious."
8142,[Expert recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial lung disease caused by novel coronavirus pneumonia].,"COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). COVID-19 may manifest bilateral interstitial pneumonia on imaging. About 30%-60% of patients present varying degrees of interstitial changes, while most patients have a good prognosis. Since there's little practical instruct on treating interstitial lung disease (ILD) caused by COVID-19, we present this file as references for all the colleagues fighting with this disease. The primary findings on CT are bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation. Inter-/intra-lobular septal thickening are also common. Subpleural lines and traction bronchiectasis can be seen in some cases which indicate the presence of interstitial fibrosis. Images of severe cases are similar with those in advanced stage of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and organizing pneumonia (OP). COVID-19 could present the typical two phases of diffuse alveolar damage: acute and proliferative phase on pathology. Massive pulmonary interstitial fibrosis may also be present. HRCT is the best radiological approach for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, and to assess the presence of ILD. Periodical CT following-up is recommended for patients who present interstitial manifestations. Biomarkers such as KL-6, SP-D, RAGE may also helpful on evaluating the severity of interstitial fibrosis and therapeutic response. We do not suggest applying pulmonary function tests and 6-minute walking test on patients in active stage of the disease. The primary treatments in acute phase are antiviral therapy and supportive treatment. We do not suggest routine use of corticosteroids, while on patients with excessive activation of inflammatory response or rapid progression of lung lesions, a low to medium dosage of corticosteroids could be applied for a short course. Pirfenidone and Nintedanib are encouraged to apply on patients in reparative phase with evidence of progressing fibrosis. Low to medium dosage of corticosteroids is also feasible on patients with NSIP or OP manifestation in this phase, with a relatively longer course. Chinese traditional medicine and rehabilitation medicine may also helpful. Lung transplant surgery is an option for severe pulmonary fibrosis patients. Patients should receive CT following-up after be discharged from hospital, especially those whose pulmonary exudation is not well absorbed. We suggest a routine following-up on month 1, 4 and 10 after discharging, and an extended period for those who have developed irreversible interstitial fibrosis."
8143,Analysis of the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.,"A newly-emergent beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, rapidly has become a pandemic since 2020. It is a serious respiratory disease and caused more than 100 million of deaths in the world. WHO named it COVIA-19 and there is no effective targeted drug for it. The main treatment strategies include chemical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and biologics. Due to SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike proteins (S proteins) on its envelope to infect human cells, monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the S protein have become one of the hot research areas in the current research and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we reviewed the antibodies that have been reported to have neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to their different binding epitope regions in RBD or NTD, they are classified, and the mechanism of the representative antibodies in each category is discussed in depth, which provides potential foundation for future antibody and vaccine therapy and the development of antibody cocktails against SARS-CoV-2 mutants."
8144,Lower nasopharyngeal viral load during the latest phase of COVID-19 pandemic in a Northern Italy University Hospital.,"Objectives: A milder clinical course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been anecdotally reported over the latest phase of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Several factors may contribute to this observation, including the effect of lockdown, social distancing, lower humidity, lower air pollution, and potential changes in the intrinsic pathogenicity of the virus. In this regard, the clinical severity of COVID-19 could be attenuated by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome that decrease its virulence, as well as by lower virus inocula. Methods: In this pilot study, we compared the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification profile of 100 nasopharyngeal swabs consecutively collected in April, during the peak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, to that of 100 swabs collected using the same procedure in May. Results: The mean Ct value of positive samples collected in May was significantly higher than that of samples collected in the previous period (ORF 1a/b gene: 31.85 ± 0.32 vs. 28.37 ± 0.5, p<0.001; E gene: 33.76 ± 0.38 vs. 29.79 ± 0.63, p<0.001), suggesting a lower viral load at the time of sampling. No significant differences were observed between male and females in the two periods, whilst higher viral loads were found in (i) patients over 60-years old, and (ii) patients that experienced severe COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic. Conclusions: This pilot study prompts further investigation on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 load and different clinical manifestation of COVID-19 during different phases of the pandemic. Laboratories should consider reporting quantitative viral load data in the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
8145,The diagnostic accuracy of isothermal nucleic acid point-of-care tests for human coronaviruses: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Many recent studies reported coronavirus point-of-care tests (POCTs) based on isothermal amplification. However, the performances of these tests have not been systematically evaluated. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy was used as a guideline for conducting this systematic review. We searched peer-reviewed and preprint articles in PubMed, BioRxiv and MedRxiv up to 28 September 2020 to identify studies that provide data to calculate sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) was applied for assessing quality of included studies and Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) was followed for reporting. We included 81 studies from 65 research articles on POCTs of SARS, MERS and COVID-19. Most studies had high risk of patient selection and index test bias but low risk in other domains. Diagnostic specificities were high (> 0.95) for included studies while sensitivities varied depending on type of assays and sample used. Most studies (n = 51) used reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to diagnose coronaviruses. RT-LAMP of RNA purified from COVID-19 patient samples had pooled sensitivity at 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90-0.96). RT-LAMP of crude samples had substantially lower sensitivity at 0.78 (95% CI: 0.65-0.87). Abbott ID Now performance was similar to RT-LAMP of crude samples. Diagnostic performances by CRISPR and RT-LAMP on purified RNA were similar. Other diagnostic platforms including RT- recombinase assisted amplification (RT-RAA) and SAMBA-II also offered high sensitivity (> 0.95). Future studies should focus on the use of un-bias patient cohorts, double-blinded index test and detection assays that do not require RNA extraction."
8146,Value of swab types and collection time on SARS-COV-2 detection using RT-PCR assay.,"Objective: Low viral load from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during infection late stage easily lead to false negative nucleic acid testing results, thus having great challenges to the prevention and control of the current pandemic. In present study, we mainly aimed to evaluate specimen types and specimen collection timepoint on the positive detection of 2019 novel coronavirus from patients at infection late stage based on RT-PCR testing. Methods: Paired nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs and anal swabs were collected from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during infection late stage before washing in the morning and afternoon on the same day. Then virus RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV identification by RT-PCR within 24 h. Results: Viral load was low at late infection stage. Specimens collected before washing in the morning would increase the detection ratio of 2019-nCoV. Detection ratio of nasopharyngeal swab [65 (95 % CI: 49.51-77.87) vs 42.5(95 % CI: 28.51-57.8)] or nasal swab [57.5 (95 % CI: 42.2-71.49) vs 35 (95 % CI: 22.13-50.49)] is higher not only than oropharyngeal swab[22.5 (95 % CI: 12.32-37.5) vs 7.5 (95 % CI: 2.58-19.86)], but also anal swab[2.5 (95 % CI: 0.44-12.88) vs 5 (95 % CI: 1.38-16.5)]. Conclusions: In summary, our research discovers that nasopharyngeal or nasal swab collected before washing in the morning might be more suitable for detecting of large-scale specimens from patients infected with low SARS-CoV-2 load during infection late stage. Those results could facilitate other laboratories in collecting appropriate specimens for improving detection of SARS-CoV-2 from patients during infection late stage as well as initially screening."
8147,Fatal Exacerbations of Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome Complicating Coronavirus Disease.,"We report 2 fatal exacerbations of systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS), also known as Clarkson disease, associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the United States. One patient carried an established diagnosis of SCLS and the other sought treatment for new-onset hypotensive shock, hemoconcentration, and anasarca, classic symptoms indicative of an SCLS flare. Both patients had only mild-to-moderate symptoms of COVID-19. This clinical picture suggests that these patients succumbed to complications of SCLS induced by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Persons with known or suspected SCLS may be at increased risk for developing a disease flare in the setting of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection."

8149,"Comprehensive Structural and Molecular Comparison of Spike Proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and Their Interactions with ACE2.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged in China and caused a disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus quickly spread around the world, causing a sustained global outbreak. Although SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) are highly similar genetically and at the protein production level, there are significant differences between them. Research has shown that the structural spike (S) protein plays an important role in the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. So far, studies have shown that various genes encoding primarily for elements of S protein undergo frequent mutation. We have performed an in-depth review of the literature covering the structural and mutational aspects of S protein in the context of SARS-CoV-2, and compared them with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Our analytical approach consisted in an initial genome and transcriptome analysis, followed by primary, secondary and tertiary protein structure analysis. Additionally, we investigated the potential effects of these differences on the S protein binding and interactions to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and we established, after extensive analysis of previous research articles, that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use different ends/regions in S protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) and different types of interactions for their chief binding with ACE2. These differences may have significant implications on pathogenesis, entry and ability to infect intermediate hosts for these coronaviruses. This review comprehensively addresses in detail the variations in S protein, its receptor-binding characteristics and detailed structural interactions, the process of cleavage involved in priming, as well as other differences between coronaviruses."
