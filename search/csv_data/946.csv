9450,Current emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Potential direct/indirect negative impacts of virus persistence and related therapeutic drugs on the aquatic compartments.,"The purpose of the present work is to provide a complete overview of possible direct/indirect implications on the quality of aquatic compartments due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. With this aim, the environmental impacts are mainly related to i) the virus persistence in sewage and wastewaters, and ii) possible fate in aquatic compartments of drugs tested and administered to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Because SARS-CoV-2 spread is very recent, and there is a lack of specific studies on this strain, the virus persistence in wastewaters, the parameters influencing the persistence, as well as the detection methodologies are referenced to the general coronaviruses group. However, the present detailed report of up-to-date knowledge on this topic can provide a useful source for further studies focusing on more deepened investigations of SARS-CoV-2 behaviour in the environment. Such a perspective is significant not only for the control of virus diffusion but also represents a crucial point for the identification of produced alteration to the environmental quality."

9453,Statins and PCSK9 inhibitors: What is their role in coronavirus disease 2019?,"Statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors interfere with several pathophysiological pathways of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Statins may have a direct antiviral effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by inhibiting its main protease. Statin-induced up-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may also be beneficial, whereas cholesterol reduction might significantly suppress SARS-CoV-2 by either blocking its host-cell entry through the disruption of lipid rafts or by inhibiting its replication. Available human studies have shown beneficial effects of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors on pneumonia and sepsis. These drugs may act as immunomodulators in COVID-19 and protect against major complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and cytokine release syndrome. Considering their antioxidative, anti-arrhythmic, antithrombotic properties and their beneficial effect on endothelial dysfunction, along with the increased risk of mortality of patients at high cardiovascular risk infected by SARS-CoV-2, statins and PCSK9 inhibitors might prove effective against the cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications of COVID-19. On the whole, randomized clinical trials are needed to establish routine use of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the meantime, it is recommended that lipid-lowering therapy should not be discontinued in COVID-19 patients unless otherwise indicated."
9454,SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Rhode Island.,"COVID-19 is a worldwide public health emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2. Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants is important for pandemic monitoring and informing public health responses. Through an interstate academic-public health partnership, we established Rhode Island's capacity to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes and created a systematic surveillance program to monitor the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the state. We describe circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Rhode Island; provide a timeline for the emerging and expanding contribution of variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI), from their first introduction to their eventual predominance over other lineages; and outline the frequent identification of known adaptively beneficial spike protein mutations that appear to have independently arisen in non-VOC/non-VOI lineages. Overall, the described Rhode Island- centric genomic surveillance initiative provides a valuable perspective on SARS-CoV-2 in the state and contributes data of interest for future epidemiological studies and state-to-state comparisons."
9455,An Evidence Based Perspective on mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Development.,"The first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late 2019. The subsequent COVID-19 pandemic rapidly affected the health and economy of the world. The global approach to the pandemic was to isolate populations to reduce the spread of this deadly virus while vaccines began to be developed. In March 2020, the first phase I clinical trial of a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, began in the United States (US). The production of mRNA-based vaccines is a promising recent development in the production of vaccines. However, there remain significant challenges in the development and testing of vaccines as rapidly as possible to control COVID-19, which requires international collaboration. This review aims to describe the background to the rationale for the development of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the current status of the mRNA-1273 vaccine."
9456,"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, Verona, Italy, April-May 2020.","We used random sampling to estimate the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Verona, Italy. Of 1,515 participants, 2.6% tested positive by serologic assay and 0.7% by reverse transcription PCR. We used latent class analysis to estimate a 3.0% probability of infection and 2.0% death rate."
9457,Amantadine in the prevention of clinical symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: Amantadine is a drug that can help in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 symptomatology, as has been demonstrated in observational clinical studies. Methods: We searched in the PubMed database Clinical Studies of coronavirus-infected patients who have been treated with amantadine in a preventive manner as well as patients with Parkinson's disease. Results: Four clinical studies were found in which relatives of patients with COVID-19 had been prescribed the use of amantadine in a preventive manner to avoid the symptoms caused by the coronavirus. Conclusion: Amantadine is a drug that can be prescribed as a prophylactic that prevents symptomatology caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus."
9458,Use of Weather Variables in SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Studies.,"The persistence and intensity of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, and the advanced planning required to balance competing concerns of saving lives and avoiding economic collapse, may depend in part on whether the virus is sensitive to seasonal changes in environmental variables, such as temperature and humidity. Although multiple studies have sought to address possible effects of these variables on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, results of these studies have been varied. It is possible that at least some of the differing results are due to insufficient understanding of atmospheric science, including certain physical and chemical principles underlying selected meteorological variables, and how global seasons differ between tropical and temperate zones. The objective of this brief perspective is to provide information that may help explain some of the differing results of studies regarding the influence of environmental variables on transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. This information may promote better variable selection and results interpretation in future studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other infectious diseases."
9459,Development of Spike Receptor-Binding Domain Nanoparticles as a Vaccine Candidate against SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Ferrets.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a causative agent of the CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, enters host cells via the interaction of its receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, the RBD is a promising vaccine target to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we report the development of an RBD protein-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 using self-assembling Helicobacter pylori-bullfrog ferritin nanoparticles as an antigen delivery system. RBD-ferritin protein purified from mammalian cells efficiently assembled into 24-mer nanoparticles. Sixteen- to 20-month-old ferrets were vaccinated with RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (RBD nanoparticles) by intramuscular or intranasal inoculation. All vaccinated ferrets with RBD nanoparticles produced potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, vaccinated ferrets demonstrated efficient protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, showing no fever, body weight loss, or clinical symptoms. Furthermore, vaccinated ferrets showed rapid clearance of infectious virus in nasal washes and lungs as well as of viral RNA in respiratory organs. This study demonstrates that spike RBD-nanoparticles are an effective protein vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2."
