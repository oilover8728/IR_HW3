1910,Controlled human infection with SARS-CoV-2 to study COVID-19 vaccines and treatments: bioethics in Utopia.,"A number of papers have appeared recently arguing for the conclusion that it is ethically acceptable to infect healthy volunteers with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as part of research projects aimed at developing COVID-19 vaccines or treatments. This position has also been endorsed in a statement by a working group for the WHO. The papers generally argue that controlled human infection (CHI) is ethically acceptable if (1) the risks to participants are low and therefore acceptable, (2) the scientific quality of the research is high, (3) the research has high social value, (4) participants give full informed consent, and (5) there is fair selection of participants. All five conditions are necessary premises in the overall argument that such research is ethically acceptable. The arguments concerning risk and informed consent have already been critically discussed in the literature. This paper therefore looks specifically at the arguments relating to condition 3 'high social value' and condition 5 'fair selection of participants' and shows that whereas they may be valid, they are not sound. It is highly unlikely that the conditions that are necessary for ethical CHI trials to take place will be fulfilled. Most, if not all, CHI trials will thus be well intentioned but unethical."
1911,Comparison of Serological Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies.,"SARS-CoV-2 virus was first detected in late 2019 and circulated globally, causing COVID-19, which is characterised by sub-clinical to severe disease in humans. Here, we investigate the serological antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection during acute and convalescent infection using a cohort of (i) COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital, (ii) healthy individuals who had experienced 'COVID-19 like-illness', and (iii) a cohort of healthy individuals prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. We compare SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection rates from four different serological methods, virus neutralisation test (VNT), ID ScreenÂ® SARS-CoV-2-N IgG ELISA, Whole Antigen ELISA, and lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus neutralisation tests (pVNT). All methods were able to detect prior infection with COVID-19, albeit with different relative sensitivities. The VNT and SARS-CoV-2-N ELISA methods showed a strong correlation yet provided increased detection rates when used in combination. A pVNT correlated strongly with SARS-CoV-2 VNT and was able to effectively discriminate SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive and negative serum with the same efficiency as the VNT. Moreover, the pVNT was performed with the same level of discrimination across multiple separate institutions. Therefore, the pVNT is a sensitive, specific, and reproducible lower biosafety level alternative to VNT for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for diagnostic and research applications. Our data illustrate the potential utility of applying VNT or pVNT and ELISA antibody tests in parallel to enhance the sensitivity of exposure to infection."
1912,A Nonadaptive Combinatorial Group Testing Strategy to Facilitate Health Care Worker Screening during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Outbreak.,"Routine testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in health care workers (HCWs) is critical. Group testing strategies to increase capacity facilitate mass population testing but do not prioritize turnaround time, an important consideration for HCW screening. We propose a nonadaptive combinatorial (NAC) group testing strategy to increase throughput while facilitating rapid turnaround. NAC matrices were constructed for sample sizes of 700, 350, and 250. Matrix performance was tested by simulation under different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence scenarios of 0.1% to 10%. NAC matrices were compared versus Dorfman sequential (DS) group testing approaches. NAC matrices performed well at low prevalence levels, with an average of 97% of samples resolved after a single round of testing via the n = 700 matrix at a prevalence of 1%. In simulations of low to medium (0.1% to 3%) prevalence, all NAC matrices were superior to the DS strategy, measured by fewer repeated tests required. At very high prevalence levels (10%), the DS matrix was marginally superior, although both group testing approaches performed poorly at high prevalence levels. This strategy maximizes the proportion of samples resolved after a single round of testing, allowing prompt return of results to HCWs. This methodology may allow laboratories to adapt their testing scheme based on required throughput and the current population prevalence, facilitating a data-driven testing strategy."
1913,Performance characteristics of the Abbott Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay.,"Mass molecular diagnostic testing for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has drawn on laboratory developed tests, commercial assays, and fully-automated platforms to accommodate widespread demand. The Alinity m instrument by Abbott is capable of detecting several clinically relevant pathogens and has recently received FDA emergency use authorization for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. The Alinity m performs automatic sample preparation, RT-PCR assembly, amplification, detection, and result calculation in under two hours. Here, we validate the performance characteristics of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay in comparison with the Roche cobas 6800 and Hologic Panther Fusion platforms. Across 178 positive and 195 negative nasopharyngeal swab specimens (CT range 14.30-38.84), the Alinity m detected one additional positive specimen that was found to be negative on the Roche cobas 6800 (PPA 100%, NPA 99.5%). Across a separate set of 30 positive and 174 negative nasopharyngeal swab specimens (CT range 14.1-38.5), the Alinity m had 100% positive and negative agreement with the Hologic Panther Fusion. Using SeraCare SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards, the assay limit of detection was verified to be two-fold more sensitive than the parameters stated by the SARS-CoV-2 AMP kit package insert, at 50 virus copies/mL. Assay specificity was 100% over 20 specimens positive for other respiratory viruses and intraday precision was 100% concordant with <2% CV. These data illst u illustrate the Abbott Alinity m system's high concordance with reference assays and analyti high analytical for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection."
1914,Patients With Uncomplicated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Have Long-Term Persistent Symptoms and Functional Impairment Similar to Patients with Severe COVID-19: A Cautionary Tale During a Global Pandemic.,"To assess the prevalence of persistent functional impairment after coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we assessed 118 individuals 3-4 months after their initial COVID-19 diagnosis with a symptom survey, work productivity and activity index questionnaire, and 6-minute walk test. We found significant persistent symptoms and functional impairment, even in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19."
1915,"COVID-19 Vaccines: Current Understanding on Immunogenicity, Safety, and Further Considerations.","The world has entered the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its intensity is significantly higher than that of the first wave of early 2020. Many countries or regions have been forced to start the second round of lockdowns. To respond rapidly to this global pandemic, dozens of COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been developed and many are undergoing clinical testing. Evaluating and defining effective vaccine candidates for human use is crucial for prioritizing vaccination programs against COVID-19. In this review, we have summarized and analyzed the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety data from clinical reports on different COVID-19 vaccines. We discuss the various guidelines laid out for the development of vaccines and the importance of biological standards for comparing the performance of vaccines. Lastly, we highlight the key remaining challenges, possible strategies for addressing them and the expected improvements in the next generation of COVID-19 vaccines."
1916,[COVID-19 vaccines: the facts].,"Not all physicians advocate for large-scale vaccination programmes against COVID-19. In this article, we respond on some of their reflections. Moreover, we explain that there are strong arguments for these large-scale vaccination programmes, aimed to prevent COVID-19 associated morbidity, mortality and overwhelmed health care systems, and to hinder the emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the virus transmission."
1917,[The pitfalls of preventive testing for SARS-CoV-2].,"The Dutch test capacity to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus has increased enormously since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of ongoing spreading of the virus, tests are also increasingly being carried out among people without COVID-19 related symptoms. Preventive testing for SARS-CoV-2 is especially performed in sectors in which early detection of the virus is essential, for instance in the professional sports sector. The guideline of the RIVM states that people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but without COVID-19 related symptoms are advised to stay in isolation for five days from time of the test. However, this guideline is not suitable for people who are diagnosed in a very early stage of the infection as a result of preventive testing. They are likely to leave isolation during the most contagious phase of the infection. In this paper, we argue that people who are positive for SARS-CoV-2, but without COVID-19 related symptoms, after a preventive test should be advised to isolate longer than five days."
1918,"Analysis of a persistent viral shedding patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR, FilmArray Respiratory Panel v2.1, and antigen detection.","Various diagnostic tests utilizing different principles are currently under development for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, these tests can occasionally produce discrepant results, causing confusion in their interpretation. Here, we evaluated the performance and features of three diagnostic assays: quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) v2.1, and the LUMIPULSE antigen test. Twenty-seven serial nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from a prolonged viral shedding patient who had been hospitalized for 51 days. We examined the SARS-CoV-2 detection rates of the three tests. The overall agreement rate was 81% between RT-qPCR and FilmArray RP v2.1, 63% between the antigen test and FilmArray RP v2.1, and 59% between the antigen test and RT-qPCR. We obtained concordant results in samples with high viral loads (low threshold cycle values) by all three tests. RT-qPCR and FilmArray RP v2.1 accurately detected SARS-CoV-2 at the early to intermediate phases of infection, but the results varied at the late phase. The antigen test also produced a positive result at the early phase but varied at the intermediate phase and consistently produced negative results at late phase of infection. These results demonstrated FilmArray RP v2.1 could detect SARS-CoV-2 with accuracy comparable to RT-qPCR. Further, there were discrepant results using different types of diagnostic tests during the clinical course of prolonged viral shedding patient. We provided insights into how to utilize different types of kits to assess and manage SARS-CoV-2 infections."
