1840,Phase 1 randomized trial of a plant-derived virus-like particle vaccine for COVID-19.,"Several severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines are being deployed, but the global need greatly exceeds the supply, and different formulations might be required for specific populations. Here we report Day 42 interim safety and immunogenicity data from an observer-blinded, dose escalation, randomized controlled study of a virus-like particle vaccine candidate produced in plants that displays the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (CoVLP: NCT04450004 ). The co-primary outcomes were the short-term tolerability/safety and immunogenicity of CoVLP formulations assessed by neutralizing antibody (NAb) and cellular responses. Secondary outcomes in this ongoing study include safety and immunogenicity assessments up to 12 months after vaccination. Adults (18-55 years, n = 180) were randomized at two sites in Quebec, Canada, to receive two intramuscular doses of CoVLP (3.75 μg, 7.5 μg, and 15 μg) 21 d apart, alone or adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG1018. All formulations were well tolerated, and adverse events after vaccination were generally mild to moderate, transient and highest in the adjuvanted groups. There was no CoVLP dose effect on serum NAbs, but titers increased significantly with both adjuvants. After the second dose, NAbs in the CoVLP + AS03 groups were more than tenfold higher than titers in Coronavirus 2019 convalescent sera. Both spike protein-specific interferon-γ and interleukin-4 cellular responses were also induced. This pre-specified interim analysis supports further evaluation of the CoVLP vaccine candidate."
1841,Findings from the first public COVID-19 temporary test centre in Hong Kong.,"Introduction: The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region established a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) temporary test centre at the AsiaWorld-Expo from March 2020 to April 2020, which allowed high-risk individuals to undergo early assessment of potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study reviewed the characteristics and outcomes of individuals who attended the centre for COVID-19 testing. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study collected epidemiological and clinical data. The primary outcome was a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result, according to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses of pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs collected at the centre. The relationships of clinical characteristics with SARS-CoV-2 positive test results were assessed by multivariable binary logistic regression. Results: Of 1258 attendees included in the analysis, 86 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (positivity rate=6.84%; 95% confidence interval [CI]=5.57%-8.37%). Of these 86 individuals, 40 (46.5%) were aged 15 to 24 years and 81 (94.2%) had a history of recent travel. Symptoms were reported by 86.0% and 96.3% of individuals with positive and negative test results, respectively. The clinical characteristics most strongly associated with a positive test result were anosmia (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=8.30; 95% CI=1.12-127.09) and fever ORadj=1.32; 95% CI=1.02-3.28). Conclusion: The temporary test centre successfully helped identify individuals with COVID-19 who exhibited mild disease symptoms. Healthcare providers should carefully consider the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 to arrange early testing to reduce community spread."
1842,"Estimating the impact of public health strategies on the spread of SARS-CoV-2: Epidemiological modelling for Toulouse, France.","The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease COVID-19 has killed over 2 million people as of 22 January 2021. We have used a modified susceptible, infected, recovered epidemiological model to predict how the spread of the virus in France will vary depending on the public health strategies adopted, including anti-COVID-19 vaccination. Our prediction model indicates that the French authorities' adoption of a gradual release from lockdown could lead in March 2021 to a virus prevalence similar to that before lockdown. However, a massive vaccination campaign initiated in January 2021 and the continuation of public health measures over several months could curb the spread of virus and thus relieve the load on hospitals."
1843,Diagnosis of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): rRT-PCR or CT?,"Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion, who were examined by both CT and rRT-PCR at initial presentation. The sensitivities of both tests were then compared. For patients with a final confirmed diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data, in addition to CT imaging findings were evaluated. Results: A total of 36 patients were finally diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Thirty-five patients had abnormal CT findings at presentation, whereas one patient had a normal CT. Using rRT-PCR, 30 patients were tested positive, with 6 cases initially missed. Amongst these 6 patients, 3 became positive in the second rRT-PCR assay(after 2 days, 2 days and 3 days respectively), and the other 3 became positive only in the third round of rRT-PCR tests(after 5 days, 6 days and 8 days respectively). At presentation, CT sensitivity was therefore 97.2%, whereas the sensitivity of initial rRT-PCR was only 83.3%. Conclusion: rRT-PCR may produce initial false negative results. We suggest that patients with typical CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results should be isolated, and rRT-PCR should be repeated to avoid misdiagnosis."
1844,Antibodies elicited by mRNA-1273 vaccination bind more broadly to the receptor binding domain than do those from SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with mutations in key antibody epitopes has raised concerns that antigenic evolution could erode adaptive immunity elicited by prior infection or vaccination. The susceptibility of immunity to viral evolution is shaped in part by the breadth of epitopes targeted by antibodies elicited by vaccination or natural infection. To investigate how human antibody responses to vaccines are influenced by viral mutations, we used deep mutational scanning to compare the specificity of polyclonal antibodies elicited by either two doses of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine or natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. The neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies was more targeted to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared to antibodies elicited by natural infection. However, within the RBD, binding of vaccine-elicited antibodies was more broadly distributed across epitopes compared to infection-elicited antibodies. This greater binding breadth means that single RBD mutations have less impact on neutralization by vaccine sera compared to convalescent sera. Therefore, antibody immunity acquired by natural infection or different modes of vaccination may have a differing susceptibility to erosion by SARS-CoV-2 evolution."
1845,Validation of real-time RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Republic of Korea.,"A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay that does not require Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) reagents was tested and validated for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the early stages of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Republic of Korea. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables timely treatment and the implementation of public health measures. We validated the sensitivity, specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy, and robustness of the RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection and compared its performance with that of several EUA-approved kits. Our RT-qPCR assay was highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by not amplifying 13 other viruses that cause respiratory diseases. The assay showed high linearity using a viral isolate from a patient with known COVID-19 as well as plasmids containing target SARS-CoV-2 genes as templates. The assay showed good repeatability and reproducibility with a coefficient of variation of 3%, and a SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection of 1 PFU/mL. The RT-qPCR-based assay is highly effective and can facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19 without the use of EUA-approved kits or reagents in the Republic of Korea."
1846,"Detection of 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by rRT-PCR at Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh.","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly pathogenic viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern. WHO has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic disease on March 11, 2020 and characterized by fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases. The virus has spread to at least 213 countries and more than 9093827 confirmed cases and 471490 deaths have been recorded. In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread. There are some newly developed and promising methods for detection of SARS-CoV-2, in order to facilitate the development of novel approaches for early diagnosis. Nucleic acid based tests currently offer the most sensitive and early detection and confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the most popular and the ""gold standard"" testing method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The present study was carried out to detect 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by rRT-PCR method at Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from 1st April, 2020 to 31st May, 2020. A total of 14356 samples were tested from four districts of Mymensingh division namely, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, Sherpur, Netrokona and some parts of Sunamganj for rRT-PCR. Among them 1086 (7.5%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Out of 1086 positive cases 716(65.9%) were male and 370(34.1%) were female with a Mean±SD age 34.1±12 years. Maximum positivity was found in Mymensingh district followed by Netrokona, Jamalpur, Sherpur and Sunamganj respectively. This is the first base line study for genetic detection of 2019-nCoV in Mymensingh division which may reflect the total scenario of Bangladesh situation. We hope this paper will help the researcher to increase the availability, accuracy, and speed of widespread COVID-19 testing throughout the world in this crisis moment."

1848,COVID-19 - pathogenesis and immunological findings across the clinical manifestation spectrum.,"Purpose of review: The wide spectrum of COVID-19 clinical manifestations demonstrates the determinant role played by the individual immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the course of the disease. Thanks to the large number of published data, we are beginning to understand the logic of the human response to a virus adapted to bat immunity. Recent findings: Impairment of types I and III interferon responses may facilitate the occurrence of severe COVID-19 with reduced antiviral activity associated to potent inflammation. The human T and B-cell germline repertoire contain the specificities able to react against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Although inflammation disrupts the structure of germinal centers, memory T and B cells can be found in the blood of patients after mild and severe COVID 19. Summary: Further studies are indispensable to better understand the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The diversity of the individual reaction may contribute to explain the clinical manifestation spectrum. Immunological memory can be demonstrated in patients, convalescent from mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, but we do not know whether asymptomatic individuals have memory of the virus. Tailored vaccination protocols may be needed for individuals with previous SAS-CoV-2 infection."
