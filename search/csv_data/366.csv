3650,Assessment of adjuvantation strategy of lipid squalene nanoparticles for enhancing the immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit protein against COVID-19.,"Vaccination is regarded as the most effective intervention for controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The objective of this study is to provide comprehensive information on lipid squalene nanoparticle (SQ@NP)-adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccines regarding modulating immune response and enhancing vaccine efficacy. After being adjuvanted with SQ@NP, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) subunit protein was intramuscularly (i.m.) administered to mice. Serum samples investigated by ELISA and virus neutralizing assay showed that a single-dose SQ@NP-adjuvanted S-protein vaccine can induce antigen-specific IgG and protective antibodies comparable with those induced by two doses of nonadjuvanted protein vaccine. When the mice received a boosting vaccine injection, anamnestic response was observed in the groups of adjuvanted vaccine. Furthermore, the secretion of cytokines in splenocytes, such as interferon (IFN)-Î³, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-10, was significantly enhanced after adjuvantation of S-protein vaccine with SQ@NP; however, this was not the case for the vaccine adjuvanted with conventional aluminum mineral salts. Histological examination of injection sites showed that the SQ@NP-adjuvanted vaccine was considerably well tolerated following i.m. injection in mice. These results pave the way for the performance tuning of optimal vaccine formulations against COVID-19."
3651,Recurrent Positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a Clinically Recovered COVID-19 Patient with End Stage Renal Disease: A Case Report.,"Recurrent or persistent positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinically recovered COVID-19 patients have been reported worldwide. However, replication competent live viruses were not recovered beyond two to three weeks from onset of symptoms in mild to severe cases of COVID-19. End stage renal disease is characterized by uremia induced immune dysfunction that increases the risk of infectious diseases including COVID-19. The clinical implications of recurrent or persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in immunocompromised patients are difficult to be generalized to findings as in immunocompetent patients. We report a case of end stage renal disease with recent history of recovered COVID-19 pneumonia, who again presented with positive reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA."

3653,Launching a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing program on a university campus.,"Regular surveillance testing of asymptomatic individuals for SARS-CoV-2 has been center to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak prevention on college and university campuses. Here we describe the voluntary saliva testing program instituted at the University of California, Berkeley during an early period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020. The program was administered as a research study ahead of clinical implementation, enabling us to launch surveillance testing while continuing to optimize the assay. Results of both the testing protocol itself and the study participants' experience show how the program succeeded in providing routine, robust testing capable of contributing to outbreak prevention within a campus community and offer strategies for encouraging participation and a sense of civic responsibility."

3656,Exploring algae and cyanobacteria as a promising natural source of antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2.,"The present outburst of coronavirus-associated (SARS-CoV-2) acute respiratory disease coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China is the third recognised spill over due to the zoonotic transmission. SARS-CoVs are about 29.7 kb positive, single stranded (ss) RNA viruses that are considered as zoonotic pathogens, bat being their natural reservoirs and also shows transmission within humans. The rapidly increasing COVID-19 cases and need of best and efficient drug/vaccine/strategy to counteract the virus entry and its pathogenesis has made it a Herculean challenge for scientists. Synthetic drugs associated complications has attracted scientific attention for natural product-based drugs. Chemo-diversity of algae and cyanobacteria offers a novel approach and can be recognized as a relevant source for developing a future natural ""antiviral drug"". The aim of this review is to highlight important features of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and the antiviral compounds recognized in algae and cyanobacteria, with their mechanisms of actions. Algae possess both immunity improving capacity and suppresses many viruses. Thus, they can be recommended as a preventive and curative remedy against SARS-CoV-2."
