2601,The COVID-19 vaccine social media infodemic: healthcare providers' missed dose in addressing misinformation and vaccine hesitancy.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, antivaccination social media accounts are proliferating online, threatening to further escalate vaccine hesitancy related to the COVID-19 vaccine. This commentary seeks to alert and encourage the health care provider community, including health care professionals and academic organizations, to engage in social media to counter the mounting vaccine-related infodemic. To validate our recommendation for engagement, the authors describe preliminary findings using a mixed methods approach of quantitative Twitter-based ranking algorithms of networks and users with qualitative content analysis of 1 million tweets related to COVID-19 vaccine conversations. Results show highly polarized and active antivaccine conversations that were primarily influenced by political and nonmedical Twitter users. In contrast, less than 10% of the tweets stemmed from the medical community, demonstrating a lack of active health care professional connectivity in addressing COVID-19 misinformation. The authors introduce the concept of Health Care Provider Social Media Hesitancy to refer to the public health threat of health care providers' nonaction in providing pro-vaccine and scientific information about the vaccine on social media. The authors conclude by describing multilevel strategies for encouraging health care providers and the medical community to effectively ""Tweet up"" to combat the mounting threat of vaccine misinformation and hesitancy."
2602,Effectiveness of BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine in Preventing Severe Symptomatic Infection among Healthcare Workers.,"Background and Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in preventing severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed infection among healthcare workers in a real-world scenario. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort study was conducted. Subjects with onset illness from January to February 2021 were eligible and classified according to the number of vaccine doses received (single-shot, n = 8; two-shot, n = 12; unvaccinated, n = 290). Results: The vaccine effectiveness against severe illness was 100% in the single and two-shot group. The presented results suggest that vaccination reduces the frequency of severe symptomatic COVID-19 in working-age adults. Conclusions: Efforts focusing on maximizing the number of immunized subjects in the study population may reduce associated economic and social burdens."
2603,COVID-19 vaccination in our transplant recipients: The time is now.,"We are entering 2021 with an expanding and effective COVID-19 vaccine armamentarium. Recent interim results from COVID-19 vaccine trials, including more than 80,000 participants worldwide, demonstrate remarkable efficacy and low rate of serious adverse events. Based on experience with other vaccines in transplant recipients and knowing the risk of severe COVID-19 in this population, we believe that COVID-19 vaccines provide potential benefit with minimal risk. We strongly support and encourage COVID-19 vaccination of our transplant recipients."
2604,Initial SARS-CoV-2 PCR crossing point does not predict hospitalization and duration of PCR positivity.,"This study aimed to determine if the crossing point of the initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test correlated with patient demographics, subsequent hospitalization, or duration of positivity. Seventy-three patients with two or more positive PCR tests had a median time of 23 days to two consecutive negative results."
2605,Development of multi-epitope peptide-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic involving so far more than 22 million infections and 776,157 deaths. Effective vaccines are urgently needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. No vaccines have yet been approved for licensure by regulatory agencies. Even though host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections are beginning to be unravelled, effective clearance of virus will depend on both humoral and cellular immunity. Additionally, the presence of Spike (S)-glycoprotein reactive CD4+ T-cells in the majority of convalescent patients is consistent with its significant role in stimulating B and CD8+ T-cells. The search for immunodominant epitopes relies on experimental evaluation of peptides representing the epitopes from overlapping peptide libraries which can be costly and labor-intensive. Recent advancements in B- and T-cell epitope predictions by bioinformatic analysis have led to epitope identifications. Assessing which peptide epitope can induce potent neutralizing antibodies and robust T-cell responses is a prerequisite for the selection of effective epitopes to be incorporated in peptide-based vaccines. This review discusses the roles of B- and T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infections and experimental validations for the selection of B-, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes which could lead to the construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine. Peptide-based vaccines are known for their low immunogenicity which could be overcome by incorporating immunostimulatory adjuvants and nanoparticles such as Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) or chitosan."
2606,Unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccine: A looming crisis.,
2607,[Update 2021: COVID-19 from the perspective of nephrology].,"Increasing insight into the clinical phenotype and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 has identified damage of the kidneys as a key player in the course of the disease. This manuscript updates our previous summary with current knowledge on kidney involvement in COVID-19 and chronic kidney disease as a risk factor for severe COVID-19, as well as recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for patients suffering from chronic kidney disease and after organ transplantation, respectively. populations, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is strongly recommended for all patients suffering from chronic kidney disease and after kidney transplantation."
2608,"Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders, T-Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines, and the Risk of Chronic COVID-19.","COVID-19 has had a calamitous effect on the global community. Despite intense study, the immunologic response to the infection is only partially understood. In addition to older age and ethnicity, patients with comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, malignancy, renal, and pulmonary disease may experience severe outcomes. Some patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) and secondary immunodeficiency also appear to be at increased risk from COVID-19. In addition to vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, patients with PIDs often have chronic pulmonary disease and may not respond to vaccines, which exacerbates their long-term risk. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders, the most frequent symptomatic PID in adults and children, have a spectrum of B- and T-cell defects. It may be possible to stratify their risk for severe COVID-19 based on age, ethnicity, the severity of the T-cell defect, and the presence of other comorbidities. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders and other immunodeficiencies are at risk for Chronic COVID-19, a dangerous stalemate between a suboptimal immune response and SARS-CoV-2. Intra-host viral evolution could result in the rapid emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and variants of high consequence; it is a public health emergency. Vaccination and prevention of Chronic COVID-19 in immunodeficient patients is therefore of the utmost priority. Having a reliable diagnostic assay for T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for evaluating responses to vaccines in these patients. New treatments for SARS-CoV-2 such as NZACE2-PƒÅtari are likely to be particularly beneficial for immunodeficient patients, especially those who fail to mount a robust T-cell response to COVID-19 vaccines."
2609,Adjusting RT-qPCR conditions to avoid unspecific amplification in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and quickly spread around the world, forcing global health authorities to develop protocols for its diagnosis. Here we report dimer formation in the N2 primers-probe set (CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR) used in the diagnostic routine, and propose alternatives to reduce dimerization events. Late unspecific amplifications were visualized in 56.4% of negative samples and 57.1% of no-template control, but not in positive samples or positive control. In silico analysis and gel electrophoresis confirmed the dimer formation. The RT-qPCR parameters were optimized and the late unspecific amplifications decreased to 11.5% in negative samples and no-template control. The adjustment of PCR parameters was essential to reduce the risk of false-positives results and to avoid inclusive results requiring repeat testing, which increases the costs and generates delays in results or even unnecessary requests for new samples."
