3450,Possible COVID-19 reinfection in a patient with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia.,"This report highlights the case of a patient with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) and resultant bronchiectasis who was discharged from hospital after recovering from real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR positive COVID-19 infection having had a subsequent negative swab and resolution of symptoms, but was readmitted 3 weeks later with recrudescent symptoms and a further positive swab. Although there are reports of COVID-19 infection in XLA, for the first time we report a case of possible reinfection. Lessons learnt from this case include the potential for reinfection of COVID-19 in a patient with a weakened immune system and the importance of repeating COVID-19 swabs in inpatients. Extra caution needs to be taken when providing care in groups of patients who have a weakened or absent immune system."

3452,"Long-Term Symptoms Among Adults Tested for SARS-CoV-2 - United States, January 2020-April 2021.","Long-term symptoms often associated with COVID-19 (post-COVID conditions or long COVID) are an emerging public health concern that is not well understood. Prevalence of post-COVID conditions has been reported among persons who have had COVID-19 (range = 5%-80%), with differences possibly related to different study populations, case definitions, and data sources (1). Few studies of post-COVID conditions have comparisons with the general population of adults with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, limiting ability to assess background symptom prevalence (1). CDC used a nonprobability-based Internet panel established by Porter Novelli Public Services* to administer a survey to a nationwide sample of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years to compare the prevalence of long-term symptoms (those lasting >4 weeks since onset) among persons who self-reported ever receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result with the prevalence of similar symptoms among persons who reported always receiving a negative test result. The weighted prevalence of ever testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.6%-23.8%). Approximately two thirds of respondents who had received a positive test result experienced long-term symptoms often associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with respondents who received a negative test result, those who received a positive test result reported a significantly higher prevalence of any long-term symptom (65.9% versus 42.9%), fatigue (22.5% versus 12.0%), change in sense of smell or taste (17.3% versus 1.7%), shortness of breath (15.5% versus 5.2%), cough (14.5% versus 4.9%), headache (13.8% versus 9.9%), and persistence (>4 weeks) of at least one initially occurring symptom (76.2% versus 69.6%). Compared with respondents who received a negative test result, a larger proportion of those who received a positive test result reported believing that receiving a COVID-19 vaccine made their long-term symptoms better (28.7% versus 15.7%). Efforts to address post-COVID conditions should include helping health care professionals recognize the most common post-COVID conditions and optimize care for patients with persisting symptoms, including messaging on potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination."

3456,"Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in 45,965 adults from the general population of the United Kingdom.","We report that in a cohort of 45,965 adults, who were receiving either the ChAdOx1 or the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, in those who had no prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, seroconversion rates and quantitative antibody levels after a single dose were lower in older individuals, especially in those aged >60 years. Two vaccine doses achieved high responses across all ages. Antibody levels increased more slowly and to lower levels with a single dose of ChAdOx1 compared with a single dose of BNT162b2, but waned following a single dose of BNT162b2 in older individuals. In descriptive latent class models, we identified four responder subgroups, including a 'low responder' group that more commonly consisted of people aged >75 years, males and individuals with long-term health conditions. Given our findings, we propose that available vaccines should be prioritized for those not previously infected and that second doses should be prioritized for individuals aged >60 years. Further data are needed to better understand the extent to which quantitative antibody responses are associated with vaccine-mediated protection."
3457,Exploring Risks of Human Challenge Trials For COVID-19.,"Human challenge trials (HCTs) are a potential method to accelerate development of vaccines and therapeutics. However, HCTs for COVID-19 pose ethical and practical challenges, in part due to the unclear and developing risks. In this article , we introduce an interactive model for exploring some risks of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) dosing study, a prerequisite for any COVID-19 challenge trials. The risk estimates we use are based on a Bayesian evidence synthesis model which can incorporate new data on infection fatality risks (IFRs) to patients, and infer rates of hospitalization. The model estimates individual risk, which we then extrapolate to overall mortality and hospitalization risk in a dosing study. We provide a web tool to explore risk under different study designs. Based on the Bayesian model, IFR for someone between 20 and 30 years of age is 15.1 in 100,000, with a 95% uncertainty interval from 11.8 to 19.2, while risk of hospitalization is 130 per 100,000 (100-160). However, risk will be reduced in an HCT via screening for comorbidities, selecting lower-risk population, and providing treatment. Accounting for this with stronger assumptions, we project the fatality risk to be as low as 2.5 per 100,000 (1.6-3.9) and the hospitalization risk to be 22.0 per 100,000 (14.0-33.7). We therefore find a 50-person dosing trial has a 99.74% (99.8-99.9%) chance of no fatalities, and a 98.9% (98.3-99.3%) probability of no cases requiring hospitalization."
3458,Unexpected False-Positive Rates in Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 Serology Using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG Assay.,"Objectives: Serologic assay performance studies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-​2) in pediatric populations are lacking, and few seroprevalence studies have routinely incorporated orthogonal testing to improve accuracy. Methods: Remnant serum samples for routine bloodwork from 2,338 pediatric patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh were assessed using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (EuroIGG) assay. Reactive cases with sufficient volume were also tested using 3 additional commercial assays. Results: Eighty-five specimens were reactive according to the EuroIGG, yielding 3.64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91%-4.48%) seropositivity, of which 73 specimens had sufficient remaining volume for confirmation by orthogonal testing. Overall, 19.18% (95% CI, 10.18%-28.18%) of samples were positive on a second and/or third orthogonal assay. This 80.82% false positivity rate is disproportionate to the expected false positivity rate of 50% given our pediatric population prevalence and assay performance. Conclusions: In pediatric populations, false-positive SARS-CoV-2 serology may be more common than assay and prevalence parameters would predict, and further studies are needed to establish the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology in children."
3459,Reliable and highly sensitive biosensor from suspended MoS(2) atomic layer on nano-gap electrodes.,"The uneven morphology and the trapped charges at the surface of the traditionally used supporting substrate-based 2D biosensors produces a scattering effect, which leads to a irregular signals from individually fabricated devices. Though suspended 2D channel material has the potential to overcome scattering effects from the substrates but achieving reliability and selectivity, have been limiting the using of this biosensor technology. Here, we have demonstrated nanogap electrodes fabrication by using the self-assembly technique, which provides suspension to the 2D-MoS2. These nano-spacing electrodes not only give suspension but also provide robustness strength to the atomic layer, which remains freestanding after coating of the Hafnium oxide (HfO2) as well as linkers and antibodies. For evaluating the electrical characteristics of suspended MoS2 FET, gating potential was applied through an electrolyte on the suspended MoS2 transistor. This helped in achieved a lower subthreshold swing 70 mV/dec and ON/OFF ratio 107. Later, pH detection was conducted at room temperature, which showed an impressive sensitivity of ~880 by changing 1 unit of pH. We have also successfully shown Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria sensing from the suspended MoS2 transistor by functionalizing dielectric layer with E. coli antibodies. The reported biosensor has shown the ~9% of conductance changes with a lower concentration of E. coli (10 CFU/mL; colony-forming unit per mL) as well as maintain the constant sensitivity in three fabricated devices. The obtained enhancement in the sensitivity of devices and its effect on biomolecules detection can be extened to other biomolecules and this type of architecture has the potential to detect COVID-19 viruses based biomolecules."
