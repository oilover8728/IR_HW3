5701,COVID-19 Encephalitis with SARS-CoV-2 Detected in Cerebrospinal Fluid Presenting as a Stroke Mimic.,"We report the case of a 35-year-old male with COVID-19 encephalitis presenting as a stroke mimic with sudden-onset expressive and receptive dysphasia, mild confusion and right arm incoordination. The patient received thrombolysis for a suspected ischaemic stroke, but later became febrile and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. Electroencephalography demonstrated excess in slow waves, but neuroimaging was reported as normal. Respiratory symptoms were absent throughout and nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. At the most recent follow-up, the patient had made a full neurological recovery. Clinicians should therefore consider testing for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF in patients who present with acute focal neurology, confusion and fever during the pandemic, even when there is no evidence of respiratory infection."
5702,"Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes, Maternal Complications, and Severe Illness Among US Delivery Hospitalizations With and Without a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Diagnosis.","Background: Evidence on risk for adverse outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among pregnant women is still emerging. We examined the association between COVID-19 at delivery and adverse pregnancy outcomes, maternal complications, and severe illness, and whether these associations differ by race/ethnicity, and describe discharge status by COVID-19 diagnosis and maternal complications. Methods: Data from 703 hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database during March-September 2020 were included. Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) overall and stratified by race/ethnicity were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Proportion not discharged home was calculated by maternal complications, stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: Among 489 471 delivery hospitalizations, 6550 (1.3%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis. In adjusted models, COVID-19 was associated with increased risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (aRR, 34.4), death (aRR, 17.0), sepsis (aRR, 13.6), mechanical ventilation (aRR, 12.7), shock (aRR, 5.1), intensive care unit admission (aRR, 3.6), acute renal failure (aRR, 3.5), thromboembolic disease (aRR, 2.7), adverse cardiac event/outcome (aRR, 2.2), and preterm labor with preterm delivery (aRR, 1.2). Risk for any maternal complications or for any severe illness did not significantly differ by race/ethnicity. Discharge status did not differ by COVID-19; however, among women with concurrent maternal complications, a greater proportion of those with (vs without) COVID-19 were not discharged home. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the importance of implementing recommended prevention strategies to reduce risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and further inform counseling and clinical care for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic."
5703,Temporal dynamics of viral load and false negative rate influence the levels of testing necessary to combat COVID-19 spread.,"Colleges and other organizations are considering testing plans to return to operation as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Pre-symptomatic spread and high false negative rates for testing may make it difficult to stop viral spread. Here, we develop a stochastic agent-based model of COVID-19 in a university sized population, considering the dynamics of both viral load and false negative rate of tests on the ability of testing to combat viral spread. Reported dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an apparent false negative rate from ~ 17 to ~ 48%. Nonuniform distributions of viral load and false negative rate lead to higher requirements for frequency and fraction of population tested in order to bring the apparent Reproduction number (Rt) below 1. Thus, it is important to consider non-uniform dynamics of viral spread and false negative rate in order to model effective testing plans."
5704,"Effect of vaccine effectiveness and safety on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Detroit, Michigan, July 2020.","This study examined whether future COVID-19 vaccine acceptance differed based on an experimental manipulation of the vaccine safety and effectiveness profile. Data come from the Detroit Metro Area Community Study, a population-based study conducted July 15-20, 2020. Participants were asked whether they would get a new COVID-19 vaccine after being randomly assigned information about the vaccine's effectiveness (50% or 95%) and chance of fever (5% or 20%). Among 1,117 Detroiters, 51.3% would accept a COVID-19 vaccine that is 50% effective and 77.1% would accept a vaccine that is 95% effective. Women and adults ≥65 were more accepting of a vaccine; Black Detroiters were less accepting. Believing vaccines to be important, effective, and safe was associated with higher acceptance. Uptake of a COVID-19 may be limited, depending on perceived vaccine effectiveness and general attitudes toward vaccines. Public health approaches to modifying these attitudes will be especially important in the Black community."
5705,X-Ray Equipped with Artificial Intelligence: Changing the COVID-19 Diagnostic Paradigm during the Pandemic.,"Purpose: Due to the excessive use of raw materials in diagnostic tools and equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dire need for cheaper and more effective methods in the healthcare system. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in medical sciences as low-cost and safer diagnostic methods, researchers have turned their attention to the use of imaging tools with AI that have fewer complications for patients and reduce the consumption of healthcare resources. Despite its limitations, X-ray is suggested as the first-line diagnostic modality for detecting and screening COVID-19 cases. Method: This systematic review assessed the current state of AI applications and the performance of algorithms in X-ray image analysis. The search strategy yielded 322 results from four databases and google scholar, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria. The performance statistics included the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Result: The average sensitivity and specificity of CXR equipped with AI algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis were >96% (83%-100%) and 92% (80%-100%), respectively. For common X-ray methods in COVID-19 detection, these values were 0.56 (95% CI 0.51-0.60) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.65), respectively. AI has substantially improved the diagnostic performance of X-rays in COVID-19. Conclusion: X-rays equipped with AI can serve as a tool to screen the cases requiring CT scans. The use of this tool does not waste time or impose extra costs, has minimal complications, and can thus decrease or remove unnecessary CT slices and other healthcare resources."
5706,Resilient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics workflows including viral heat inactivation.,"There is a worldwide need for reagents to perform SARS-CoV-2 detection. Some laboratories have implemented kit-free protocols, but many others do not have the capacity to develop these and/or perform manual processing. We provide multiple workflows for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in clinical samples by comparing several commercially available RNA extraction methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen), RNAdvance Blood/Viral (Beckman) and Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Bio-tek). We also compared One-step RT-qPCR reagents: TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (FastVirus, ThermoFisher Scientific), qPCRBIO Probe 1-Step Go Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems) and Luna® Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (Luna, NEB). We used primer-probes that detect viral N (EUA CDC) and RdRP. RNA extraction methods provided similar results, with Beckman performing better with our primer-probe combinations. Luna proved most sensitive although overall the three reagents did not show significant differences. N detection was more reliable than that of RdRP, particularly in samples with low viral titres. Importantly, we demonstrated that heat treatment of nasopharyngeal swabs at 70°C for 10 or 30 min, or 90°C for 10 or 30 min (both original variant and B 1.1.7) inactivated SARS-CoV-2 employing plaque assays, and had minimal impact on the sensitivity of the qPCR in clinical samples. These findings make SARS-CoV-2 testing portable in settings that do not have CL-3 facilities. In summary, we provide several testing pipelines that can be easily implemented in other laboratories and have made all our protocols and SOPs freely available at https://osf.io/uebvj/."
5707,How Should Psychiatry Respond to COVID-19 Anti-Vax Attitudes?,
5708,Experience with the COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccination in people with multiple sclerosis.,"Background: Some people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) are at increased risk of severe Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and should be rapidly vaccinated. However, vaccine supplies are limited, and there are concerns about side-effects, particularly with the ChAdOx1nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine. Objectives: To report our first experience of pwMS receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. Methods: Service evaluation. pwMS using the MS service at Barts Health NHS Trust were sent questionnaires to report symptoms following vaccination. Results: Thirty-three responses were returned, 29/33 pwMS received a first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine, the remaining four received a first dose of BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. All but two patients (94%) reported any symptoms including a sore arm (70%), flu-like symptoms (64%), fever (21%), fatigue (27%), and headache (21%). In more than 2/3 patients, symptoms lasted up to 48 hours, and with the exception of two pwMS reporting symptom duration of 10 and 12 days, respectively, symptoms in the remainder resolved within seven days. No severe adverse effects occurred. Conclusions: pwMS report transient symptoms following AstraZeneca vaccination, characteristics of which were similar to those reported in the non-MS population. Symptoms may be more pronounced in pwMS due to the temperature-dependent delay in impulse propagation (Uhthoff's phenomenon) due to demyelination."
