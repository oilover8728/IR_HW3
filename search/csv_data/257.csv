2560,The efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treatment of COVID19 -a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Introduction: The treatment of SARS CoV2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus 2) also known as COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) continues to remain an enigma even after six months of the pandemic. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been one of the most widely tested drugs for SARS CoV2 on account of its antiviral properties. However the results so far have been far from categorical. The meta-analyses conducted till date are also lacking in precision and appropriateness. This systematic review and meta-analysis addresses the efficacy and safety of HCQ in SARS CoV2 by overcoming the limitations of earlier meta-analysis. Methods: A total of 5 prominent medical databases were searched and fourteen studies (n = 12455) were included in the systematic review and meta-analyses. The data on survival, alleviation of symptoms, conversion of RT PCR positivity to negativity, use and efficacy in presence of co-morbidities (Hypertension, diabetes and heart disease) and cardiac and gastrointestinal side effects were extracted. Meta-analysis was applied to calculate the pooled estimates. Fixed-effects model results were chosen since I2 was <25%.Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Results: The pooled estimates showed that HCQ treatment did not significantly affect survival at 14 and 28 days in COVID-19 patients with respect to the control population (RR: 1.003, 95% CI: 0.983-1.022), alleviation of symptoms at day 10 (RR: 1.044, 95% CI: 0.911 1.196), success in presence of co-morbidities (RR: 1.058, 95% CI: 1.035-1.082) and conversion from RT PCR positive to RT PCR negative on day 6 (RR:1.123, 95% CI: 1.041 1.212). There was higher risk for cardiac side effects (RR: 2.012, 95% CI: 1.428 2.833) and gastrointestinal side effects (RR: 1.318, 95% CI: 0.730 2.380) in HCQ recipients. Conclusion: There is no evidence on the safety and efficacy of HCQ either alone or in combination with other drugs in SARS CoV2 infection."
2561,Indications for and contraindications of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients with COVID-19 vaccination.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has lasted over 1 year and will not disappear in a short time. There is no specific remedy against the virus as yet. Vaccination is thus far one of the most important strategies for preventing COVID-19. Cancer patients with COVID-19 have a higher mortality because of immunosuppression. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a novel anticancer strategy for blocking inhibitory pathways, which are related to the immune response. There is a question regarding whether COVID-19 vaccination and ICI treatment impact each other in cancer patients. This review explores both sides of the relationship between ICI treatment and COVID-19 vaccination and suggests good efficacy and safety of ICI treatment after COVID-19 vaccination as well as little impact on the virus protection and toxicity associated with COVID-19 vaccination during ICI treatment."
2562,Self-collection of capillary blood using Tasso-SST devices for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing.,"Background: Efforts to minimize COVID-19 exposure during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have led to limitations in access to medical care and testing. The Tasso-SST kit includes all of the components necessary for remote, capillary blood self-collection. In this study, we sought to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the Tasso-SST device as a self-collection device for measurement of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Methods: Capillary blood was obtained via unsupervised and supervised application of the Tasso-SST device, and venous blood was collected by standard venipuncture. Unsupervised self-collected blood samples underwent either extreme summer or winter-simulated shipping conditions prior to testing. Sera obtained by all three methods were tested concurrently using the EuroImmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay in a CLIA-certified clinical laboratory. Results: Successful Tasso-SST capillary blood collection by unsupervised and supervised administration was completed by 93.4% and 94.5% of participants, respectively. Sera from 56 participants, 55 with documented (PCR+) COVID-19, and 33 healthy controls were then tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Compared to venous blood results, Tasso-SST-collected (unstressed) and the summer- and winter-stressed blood samples demonstrated Deming regression slopes of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99-1.02), 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98-1.01), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-1.01), respectively, with an overall accuracy of 98.9%. Conclusions: Capillary blood self-collection using the Tasso-SST device had a high success rate. Moreover, excellent concordance was found for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG results between Tasso-SST capillary and standard venous blood-derived sera. The Tasso-SST device should enable widespread collection of capillary blood for testing without medical supervision, facilitating epidemiologic studies."
2563,"Standard Operating Procedure for Specimen Collection, Packaging and Transport for Diagnosis of SARS-COV-2.","Coronavirus disease-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2). Specimen quality, and proper transportation is vital for accurate diagnosis. This standard operating procedure is designed to educate the clinicians, nurses, paramedics, and laboratory personnel regarding proper methods of sample collection, packaging, and transportation. Nasopharyngeal swabs and/or oropharyngeal swabs should be collected for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect SARS-CoV-2. The sample should be collected wearing proper personal protective equipment, packed in a triple packaging system, and transported maintaining cold chain."

2566,Rapid response flow cytometric assay for the detection of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.,"SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a previously unknown zoonotic coronavirus that spread worldwide causing a serious pandemic. While reliable nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays were rapidly available, only a limited number of validated serological assays were available in the early phase of the pandemic. Here, we evaluated a novel flow cytometric approach to assess spike-specific antibody responses.HEK 293T cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in its natural confirmation on the surface were used to detect specific IgG and IgM antibody responses in patient sera by flow cytometry. A soluble angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE-2) variant was developed as external standard to quantify spike-specific antibody responses on different assay platforms. Analyses of 201 pre-COVID-19 sera proved a high assay specificity in comparison to commercially available CLIA and ELISA systems, while also revealing the highest sensitivity in specimens from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The external standard allowed robust quantification of antibody responses among different assay platforms. In conclusion, our newly established flow cytometric assay allows sensitive and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, which can be easily adopted in different laboratories and does not rely on external supply of assay kits. The flow cytometric assay also provides a blueprint for rapid development of serological tests to other emerging viral infections."
2567,"Vaccine effectiveness against infection with the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, Norway, April to August 2021.","Some variants of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with increased transmissibility, increased disease severity or decreased vaccine effectiveness (VE). In this population-based cohort study (n = 4,204,859), the Delta variant was identified in 5,430 (0.13%) individuals, of whom 84 were admitted to hospital. VE against laboratory confirmed infection with the Delta variant was 22.4% among partly vaccinated (95% confidence interval (CI): 17.0-27.4) and 64.6% (95% CI: 60.6-68.2) among fully vaccinated individuals, compared with 54.5% (95% CI: 50.4-58.3) and 84.4% (95%CI: 81.8-86.5) against the Alpha variant."

2569,"A 7-Year-Old Boy and a 14-Year-Old Girl Initially Diagnosed with Toxic Shock Syndrome and Tested Positive for SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Supporting a Diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).","BACKGROUND Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has recently been described in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. CASE REPORT Case 1. A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution. Case 2. A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance. The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion. The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone. However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution. CONCLUSIONS These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of MIS-C can become more prevalent, and pediatricians should be aware of diagnostic and management guidelines."
