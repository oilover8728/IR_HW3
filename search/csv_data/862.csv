8610,Classical and alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic strategy.,"Understanding the molecules that are essential for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry can provide insights into viral infection and dissemination. Recently, it has been identified from several studies that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 are the main entry molecules for the SARS-CoV-2, which produced the pandemic of Covid-19. However, additional evidence showed several other viral receptors and cellular proteases that are also important in facilitating viral entry and transmission in the target cells. In this review, we summarized the types of SARS-CoV-2 entry molecules and discussed their crucial roles for virus binding, protein priming and fusion to the cellular membrane important for SARS-CoV-2 infection."
8611,[Complex oncologic therapy for loco-regionally advanced breast cancer associated with long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positivity].,"Összefoglaló. A COVID-19 mortalitását a súlyos társbetegségek, közöttük bizonyos daganatos betegségek is növelik. Immunszuppresszív hatásuk miatt felmerülhet a citotoxikus kezelések rizikónövelő hatása is. Ugyanakkor az onkológiai terápia megszakítása vagy halasztása, különösen az agresszívebb, kiterjedtebb és fiatalkorban jelentkező daganatok esetében ronthatja a kórjóslatot. Egy 39 éves nőbeteg esetét ismertetjük. A járvány során késlekedve felismert, lokoregionálisan kiterjedt emlődaganat miatt primer szisztémás kemoterápiában részesült. A kezelés 5. ciklusa során enyhe légúti tünetek kapcsán, az onkológiai ambulancián SARS-CoV-2-fertőzése igazolódott. Kemoterápiás kezelését felfüggesztettük. A diagnózistól számított 3. napon tünetmentessé vált, ám SARS-CoV-2-PCR-pozitivitása még a 43. napon is fennállt. A 19. napon hormongátló kezelést indítottunk. Az 51. napon mastectomia és axillaris block dissectio történt. A 82. napon a megszakított kemoterápiát a hormongátló kezelés leállítását követően G-CSF-profilaxis mellett újraindítottuk. A kezelés során fertőzéses szövődményt nem észleltünk. Kemoterápia és műtét SARS-CoV-2-fertőzött, tünetmentes daganatos betegnél szövődménymentesen végezhető elhúzódó virológiai pozitivitás esetén, felszabadító vizsgálat nélkül is. A daganatos betegek koronavírus-fertőzése esetén az onkológiai protokolltól történő eltérés egyénre szabott optimalizálásával és a multidiszciplináris team szorosabb együttműködésével az infektológiai és az onkológiai kockázat együttes alacsonyan tartása is megvalósítható. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(16): 611-614. Summary. Mortality of COVID-19 is increased when certain co-morbidities, among others advanced malignancies are present. Deleterious effect of cytotoxic therapy, related to its immunosuppressive effect, may also be hypothesised. However, postponing or cancelling oncologic treatment, especially in younger patients with advanced and more aggressive tumors may worsen the prognosis. The case of a 39-year-old female patient is presented, who was diagnosed with loco-regionally advanced breast cancer during the pandemic. Primary systemic chemotherapy was started. The patient presented with acute respiratory tract symptoms during the fifth cycle and subsequently SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed. Chemotherapy was cancelled. Symptoms resolved in three days after diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 PCR remained positive up to day 43. Antihormonal therapy was introduced on day 19 and she underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection on day 51. Chemotherapy was reset postoperatively on day 82 with prophylactic G-CSF protection. No adverse event was observed throughout the treatment. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery can be successfully delivered in breast cancer patients with prolonged asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, even without negative swab result. Individual optimisation of the therapy may require deviations from standard protocols. Closer multidisciplinary cooperation may contribute to the minimisation of both oncologic and infectious risks.

8614,Mandating COVID-19 Vaccination for Health Care Workers.,"It is imperative that all 17 million health care workers in the United States be vaccinated against COVID-19. The authors believe that the best way to achieve this is for the workers to choose vaccination, but given the current situation, the authors feel that health care employers should mandate vaccination. A joint statement signed by dozens of health care professional societies and organizations endorses this requirement."
8615,Hunting coronavirus by transmission electron microscopy - a guide to SARS-CoV-2-associated ultrastructural pathology in COVID-19 tissues.,"Transmission electron microscopy has become a valuable tool to investigate tissues of COVID-19 patients because it allows visualisation of SARS-CoV-2, but the 'virus-like particles' described in several organs have been highly contested. Because most electron microscopists in pathology are not accustomed to analysing viral particles and subcellular structures, our review aims to discuss the ultrastructural changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 with respect to pathology, virology and electron microscopy. Using micrographs from infected cell cultures and autopsy tissues, we show how coronavirus replication affects ultrastructure and put the morphological findings in the context of viral replication, which induces extensive remodelling of the intracellular membrane systems. Virions assemble by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex and are characterised by electron-dense dots of cross-sections of the nucleocapsid inside the viral particles. Physiological mimickers such as multivesicular bodies or coated vesicles serve as perfect decoys. Compared to other in-situ techniques, transmission electron microscopy is the only method to visualise assembled virions in tissues, and will be required to prove SARS-CoV-2 replication outside the respiratory tract. In practice, documenting in tissues the characteristic features seen in infected cell cultures seems to be much more difficult than anticipated. In our view, the hunt for coronavirus by transmission electron microscopy is still on."
8616,"Differential diagnosis of illness in patients under investigation for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), Italy, February 2020.","A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, now named COVID-19. Most cases and sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy. Since the symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases."
8617,Awareness of dental practitioners and intern dental practitioners in Northern Cyprus towards pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.,"Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the perception, attitude, and awareness of dental practitioners (DPs) and intern DPs towards SARS-COV-2 by comparing the awareness-attitude score (AAS). Materials and methods: An online survey was generated in Google Forms. An invitation email was sent to all DPs in Northern Cyprus (n = 270) and intern DPs at Near East University (n = 200). Data were blindly collected from March 2020 to May 2020. Participants received 1 point for each correct answer. By adding up all collected points, an AAS was determined. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: The questionnaire was answered by 228 DPs (84% response-rate). No statistically significant difference was detected between gender-groups in terms of AAS (P = 0.301). A significant difference was detected between occupation groups in terms of AAS (P = 0.006), and of these, dentist-academician-group exhibited superior score. Other tested variables (specialty, way of occupation, place of occupation, and duration of occupation) had no influence on the AAS (P > 0.05). Relation between age and AAS was statistically significant (P = 0.054, Spearmen Correlation). Increasing age increases AAS as linear relation was detected between these variables (P = 0.011, Linear Regression). The questionnaire was also answered by 182 intern DPs (91% response-rate). No significant difference was detected between gender-groups (P = 0.378). Correlation was insignificant between age and AAS (P = 0.933). Conclusions: Occupation is the only variable influencing AAS of DPs. Academicians exhibited superior knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2. The AASs of DPs and intern DPs were analogous."
8618,Two Patients With Severe COVID Pneumonia Treated With the Seraph-100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter.,We present 2 patients with rapidly escalating oxygen requirements from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (COVID-19) treated with the Seraph100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter under Emergency Use Authorization from the US Federal Drug Administration. The Seraph100 is an extracorporeal hemoperfusion filter previously demonstrated to remove viral particles and pro-inflammatory cytokines from the blood. Treatment with the Seraph100 filter was associated with a rapid improvement in oxygenation and both patients were discharged from the hospital without supplemental oxygen.
8619,A Comprehensive Overview of the COVID-19 Literature: Machine Learning-Based Bibliometric Analysis.,"Background: Shortly after the emergence of COVID-19, researchers rapidly mobilized to study numerous aspects of the disease such as its evolution, clinical manifestations, effects, treatments, and vaccinations. This led to a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19-related publications. Identifying trends and areas of interest using traditional review methods (eg, scoping and systematic reviews) for such a large domain area is challenging. Objective: We aimed to conduct an extensive bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 literature. Methods: We used the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) that consists of a large number of research articles related to all coronaviruses. We used a machine learning-based method to analyze the most relevant COVID-19-related articles and extracted the most prominent topics. Specifically, we used a clustering algorithm to group published articles based on the similarity of their abstracts to identify research hotspots and current research directions. We have made our software accessible to the community via GitHub. Results: Of the 196,630 publications retrieved from the database, we included 28,904 in our analysis. The mean number of weekly publications was 990 (SD 789.3). The country that published the highest number of COVID-19-related articles was China (2950/17,270, 17.08%). The highest number of articles were published in bioRxiv. Lei Liu affiliated with the Southern University of Science and Technology in China published the highest number of articles (n=46). Based on titles and abstracts alone, we were able to identify 1515 surveys, 733 systematic reviews, 512 cohort studies, 480 meta-analyses, and 362 randomized control trials. We identified 19 different topics covered among the publications reviewed. The most dominant topic was public health response, followed by clinical care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical characteristics and risk factors, and epidemic models for its spread. Conclusions: We provide an overview of the COVID-19 literature and have identified current hotspots and research directions. Our findings can be useful for the research community to help prioritize research needs and recognize leading COVID-19 researchers, institutes, countries, and publishers. Our study shows that an AI-based bibliometric analysis has the potential to rapidly explore a large corpus of academic publications during a public health crisis. We believe that this work can be used to analyze other eHealth-related literature to help clinicians, administrators, and policy makers to obtain a holistic view of the literature and be able to categorize different topics of the existing research for further analyses. It can be further scaled (for instance, in time) to clinical summary documentation. Publishers should avoid noise in the data by developing a way to trace the evolution of individual publications and unique authors."
