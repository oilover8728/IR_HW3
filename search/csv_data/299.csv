2980,Convergence between global BCG vaccination and COVID-19 pandemic.,"The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has kept the whole world in tenterhooks due to its severe life-threatening infectious disease, COVID-19. The virus is distinct from its cousins, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of severity of the infection. The obligated killing properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is mediated by its unique structure. Efforts for developing vaccines for COVID-19 are ongoing, but it is unlikely to be available in the immediate future. Due to the absence of precise treatment, the investigators are discovering other effective, protective, and healing choices. However, the lower than a predictable number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries with fragile health systems is mystifying. Recently, there has been a buzz about the protective effect of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine in COVID-19 through long-term boosting of trained immunity. Based on epidemiological correlations, we link up that BCG vaccination adopted by different countries might influence the SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns and/or COVID-19 associated mortality through the vaccine's capacity to confer heterologous protection. A number of clinical studies are underway to investigate this possibility but even if they prove effective-many questions will remain. Moreover, responsible stewardship of the BCG vaccine in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic is directly needed."
2981,A Multiplex Microsphere IgG Assay for SARS-CoV-2 Using ACE2-Mediated Inhibition as a Surrogate for Neutralization.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the challenges inherent to the serological detection of a novel pathogen such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on their throughput, sensitivity, and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens-spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 prepandemic samples. Sensitivity was measured and compared to that of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay using serum samples from 125 unique patients equally binned (n = 25) into 5 time intervals (≤5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, and ≥21 days from symptom onset). With samples obtained at ≤5 days from symptom onset, the 3Flex assay was more sensitive (48.0% versus 32.0%), but the two assays performed comparably using serum obtained ≥21 days from symptom onset. A larger collection (n = 534) of discarded sera was profiled from patients (n = 140) whose COVID-19 course was characterized through chart review. This revealed the relative rise, peak (S, 23.8; RBD, 23.6; NP, 16.7 [in days from symptom onset]), and decline of the antibody response. Considerable interperson variation was observed with a subset of extensively sampled intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Using soluble ACE2, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD, and not for NP. Taking the data together, this study described the performance of an assay built on a flexible and high-throughput serological platform that proved adaptable to the emergence of a novel infectious agent."
2982,Nanocarrier vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.,"The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has seen rapid spread, disease morbidities and death associated with substantive social, economic and societal impacts. Treatments rely on re-purposed antivirals and immune modulatory agents focusing on attenuating the acute respiratory distress syndrome. No curative therapies exist. Vaccines remain the best hope for disease control and the principal global effort to end the pandemic. Herein, we summarize those developments with a focus on the role played by nanocarrier delivery."
2983,BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Interference with Co-Administration of Tdap Vaccine.,"BACKGROUND It is unknown if the efficacy of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccine is affected by the co-administration of other vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shifted their recommendations recently, allowing for the co-administration of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines. This is based on the experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines, where the immunogenicity and adverse event profiles were generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously or alone. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 29-year-old Asian woman who received the first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine at around the same time. BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and Tdap vaccine were administered into the deltoid region of the left arm and right arm, respectively. We then monitored for immunogenicity. We observed a delay in the development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1) protein antibodies at around 8 weeks after the second dose. CONCLUSIONS Unless warranted, it is important to adhere to current CDC recommendations with regards to the co-administration of vaccines. Although the administration of Tdap with COVID-19 vaccine in our case caused delay in immunogenicity, it did not negate the ability of the BNT162B2 mRNA vaccine to elicit an adequate immune response. The reason for delay in immune response with co-administration of COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines is unknown and further studies are needed."

2986,Partial protection of Sinopharm vaccine against SARS COV2 during recent outbreak in Bahrain.,"Background: In order to impart immunity against SARS COV 2 in the community, the oil rich countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) provided citizens and expatriates with free vaccination. Different types of vaccination brands were utilized for this purpose. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the different types of vaccinations used. Methods: This is an observational analytical case study of one Bahraini family who were vaccinated with 1st, 2nd or no dose. Results: Out of 22 double dose recipients of SARS COV2 vaccine, 20 were infected. Those 20 were vaccinated against SARS COV 2 using Sinopharm, the rest (2) were in direct contact with the source but were vaccinated against SARS COV 2 using other type of vaccine. Out of 26 single dose recipients of Sinopharm vaccine, 23 were infected. The other three were not in direct contact with the infected source. Social gathering has been the main source of transmission. The infection has been mild with headache, chest pain. From 20 cases with double dose vaccinations only one had a lung infection and needed hospitalization. Out of 23 cases with single dose vaccinations 10 were hospitalized due to lung infections. All family members who were not vaccinated were infected, three were hospitalized one of which was deceased due to diabetes mellitus complications. Conlcusion: Sinopharm provides partial protection against SARS COV 2 infection. That might be due to lack of its potential to detect recent variations in the protein structure of spike(S) protein of virus."

2988,Colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) as a visual diagnostic platform for the detection of the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"COVID-19, caused by the infection of SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a rapidly spreading infection. The disease has now reached the level of a global pandemic and as a result a more rapid and simple detection method is imperative to curb the spread of the virus. We aimed to develop a visual diagnostic platform for SARS-CoV-2 based on colorimetric RT-LAMP with levels of sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of commercial qRT-PCR assays. In this work, the primers were designed to target a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp). The assay was characterized for its sensitivity and specificity, and validated with clinical specimens collected in Thailand. The developed colorimetric RT-LAMP assay could amplify the target gene and enabled visual interpretation in 60 min at 65 °C. No cross-reactivity with six other common human respiratory viruses (influenza A virus subtypes H1 and H3, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, and human metapneumovirus) and five other human coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, HKU-1, OC43, 229E and NL63) was observed. The limit of detection was 25 copies per reaction when evaluated with contrived specimens. However, the detection rate at this concentration fell to 95.8% when the incubation time was reduced from 60 to 30 min. The diagnostic performance of the developed RT-LAMP assay was evaluated in 2120 clinical specimens and compared with the commercial qRT-PCR. The results revealed high sensitivity and specificity of 95.74% and 99.95%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the RT-LAMP assay was determined to be 99.86%. In summary, our results indicate that the developed colorimetric RT-LAMP provides a simple, sensitive and reliable approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, implying its beneficial use as a diagnostic platform for COVID-19 screening."
