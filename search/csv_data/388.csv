3871,Evaluation of the INDICAID COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test in Symptomatic Populations and Asymptomatic Community Testing.,"As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, there is an increasing need for rapid, accessible assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We present a clinical evaluation and real-world implementation of the INDICAID COVID-19 rapid antigen test (INDICAID rapid test). A multisite clinical evaluation of the INDICAID rapid test using prospectively collected nasal (bilateral anterior) swab samples from symptomatic subjects was performed. The INDICAID rapid test demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of 85.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 75.6% to 91.6%) and 94.9% (95% CI, 91.6% to 96.9%), respectively, compared to laboratory-based reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using nasal specimens. The INDICAID rapid test was then implemented at COVID-19 outbreak screening centers in Hong Kong as part of a testing algorithm (termed ""dual-track"") to screen asymptomatic individuals for prioritization for confirmatory RT-PCR testing. In one approach, preliminary positive INDICAID rapid test results triggered expedited processing for laboratory-based RT-PCR, reducing the average time to confirmatory result from 10.85 h to 7.0 h. In a second approach, preliminary positive results triggered subsequent testing with an onsite rapid RT-PCR, reducing the average time to confirmatory result to 0.84 h. In 22,994 asymptomatic patients, the INDICAID rapid test demonstrated a PPA of 84.2% (95% CI, 69.6% to 92.6%) and an NPA of 99.9% (95% CI, 99.9% to 100%) compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR using combined nasal/oropharyngeal specimens. The INDICAID rapid test has excellent performance compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR testing and, when used in tandem with RT-PCR, reduces the time to confirmatory positive result. IMPORTANCE Laboratory-based RT-PCR, the current gold standard for COVID-19 testing, can require a turnaround time of 24 to 48 h from sample collection to result. The delayed time to result limits the effectiveness of centralized RT-PCR testing to reduce transmission and stem potential outbreaks. To address this, we conducted a thorough evaluation of the INDICAID COVID-19 rapid antigen test, a 20-minute rapid antigen test, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic populations. The INDICAID rapid test demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity with RT-PCR as the comparator method. A dual-track testing algorithm was also evaluated utilizing the INDICAID rapid test to screen for preliminary positive patients, whose samples were then prioritized for RT-PCR testing. The dual-track method demonstrated significant improvements in expediting the reporting of positive RT-PCR test results compared to standard RT-PCR testing without prioritization, offering an improved strategy for community testing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks."
3872,"Clinical evaluation of a fully automated, laboratory-developed multiplex RT-PCR assay integrating dual-target SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B detection on a high-throughput platform.","Introduction. Laboratories worldwide are facing high demand for molecular testing during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, which might be further aggravated by the upcoming influenza season in the northern hemisphere.Gap Statement. Given that the symptoms of influenza are largely indistinguishable from those of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), both SARS-CoV-2 and the influenza viruses require concurrent testing by RT-PCR in patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory tract infection.Aim. We adapted and evaluated a laboratory-developed multiplex RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 (dual target), influenza A and influenza B (SC2/InflA/InflB-UCT) on a fully automated high-throughput system (cobas6800).Methodology. Analytical performance was assessed by serial dilution of quantified reference material and cell culture stocks in transport medium, including pretreatment for chemical inactivation. For clinical evaluation, residual portions of 164 predetermined patient samples containing SARS-CoV-2 (n=52), influenza A (n=43) or influenza B (n=19), as well as a set of negative samples, were subjected to the novel multiplex assay.Results. The assay demonstrated comparable analytical performance to currently available commercial tests, with limits of detection of 94.9 cp ml-1 for SARS-CoV-2, 14.6 cp ml-1 for influenza A and 422.3 cp ml-1 for influenza B. Clinical evaluation showed excellent agreement with the comparator assays (sensitivity of 98.1, 97.7 and 100 % for Sars-CoV-2 and influenza A and B, respectively).Conclusion. The SC2/InflA/InflB-UCT allows for efficient high-throughput testing for all three pathogens and thus provides streamlined diagnostics while conserving resources during the influenza season."
3873,Surveillance of wastewater revealed peaks of SARS-CoV-2 preceding those of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.,"SARS-CoV-2 was discovered among humans in Wuhan, China in late 2019, and then spread rapidly, causing a global pandemic. The virus was found to be transmitted mainly by respiratory droplets from infected persons or by direct contact. It was also shown to be excreted in feces, why we investigated whether the virus could be detected in wastewater and if so, to which extent its levels reflects its spread in society. Samples of wastewater from the city of Gothenburg, and surrounding municipalities in Sweden were collected daily from mid-February until June 2020 at the Rya wastewater treatment plant. Flow proportional samples of wastewater were collected to ensure that comparable amounts were obtained for analysis. Daily samples were pooled into weekly samples. Virus was concentrated on a filter and analyzed by RT-qPCR. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 varied with peaks approximately every four week, preceding variations in number of newly hospitalized patients by 19-21 days. At that time virus testing for COVID-19 was limited to patients with severe symptoms. Local differences in viral spread was shown by analyzing weekly composite samples of wastewater from five sampling sites for four weeks. The highest amount of virus was found from the central, eastern, and northern parts of the city. SARS-CoV-2 was also found in the treated effluent wastewater from the WWTP discharged into the recipient, the Göta River, although with a reduction of 4-log10. The viral peaks with regular temporal intervals indicated that SARS-CoV-2 may have a cluster spread, probably reflecting that the majority of infected persons only spread the disease during a few days. Our results are important for both the planning of hospital care and to rapidly identify and intervene against local spread of the virus."
3874,Joint Learning of 3D Lesion Segmentation and Classification for Explainable COVID-19 Diagnosis.,"Given the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of medical resource, extensive deep learning models have been proposed for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis, based on 3D computed tomography (CT) scans. However, the existing models independently process the 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification, ignoring the inherent correlation between these two tasks. In this paper, we propose a joint deep learning model of 3D lesion segmentation and classification for diagnosing COVID-19, called DeepSC-COVID, as the first attempt in this direction. Specifically, we establish a large-scale CT database containing 1,805 3D CT scans with fine-grained lesion annotations, and reveal 4 findings about lesion difference between COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Inspired by our findings, DeepSC-COVID is designed with 3 subnets: a cross-task feature subnet for feature extraction, a 3D lesion subnet for lesion segmentation, and a classification subnet for disease diagnosis. Besides, the task-aware loss is proposed for learning the task interaction across the 3D lesion and classification subnets. Different from all existing models for COVID-19 diagnosis, our model is interpretable with fine-grained 3D lesion distribution. Finally, extensive experimental results show that the joint learning framework in our model significantly improves the performance of 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification in both efficiency and efficacy."

3876,Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination promises to improve the catastrophic prognosis of hemodialysis patients as a result of COVID-19: the COViNEPH Project.,"Introduction There is an urgent need to check the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among hemodialyzed (HD) patients known to have extensive disturbances of acquired immunity and a catastrophic risk of death from COVID-19. Objectives In a cross-sectional study we aimed to assess the humoral response following vaccination with the BNT162b2 (BioNTech / Pfizer Comirnaty) vaccine. Patients and methods We analyzed the titer magnitude of the IgG antibodies directed against spike (S)- SARS-CoV-2 antigen 14-21 days after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in a group of HD patients who have not been confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection yet, compared to patients with a history of COVID-19. 126 HD patients were stratified based on evidence of a previous infection with SARS-COV-2 confirmed with viral RNA detection or nucleocapsid-specific IgG antibodies detection. Results s-antigen immune response with a median (IQR) antibody titer of 366 (193-691) UA/ml was seen in 87 of 91 infection naïve (IN)-HD patients (95.6%). In 68 of 91 IN-HD patients (74.7%) a strong humoral response was observed with titer anti-S antibodies above 200 UA/ml. Older subjects were less likely to develop an S-antibodies response (P <0.001). The median S-antigen antibody titer in 35 previously infected (PI)-HD patients was over 12-fold higher than in IN-HD patients; 4620 (1240-7820) UA/ml (P <0.001). There were no significant differences in S-antibody titer between symptomatic and asymptomatic PI-HD patients. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that the majority of HD patients achieved a high immunization rate after vaccination with BNT162b2. Whether this translates into protecting this population from COVID-19 requires further research."
3877,Separable Microneedle Patch to Protect and Deliver DNA Nanovaccines Against COVID-19.,"The successful control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not only relying on the development of vaccines, but also depending on the storage, transportation, and administration of vaccines. Ideally, nucleic acid vaccine should be directly delivered to proper immune cells or tissue (such as lymph nodes). However, current developed vaccines are normally treated through intramuscular injection, where immune cells do not normally reside. Meanwhile, current nucleic acid vaccines must be stored in a frozen state that may hinder their application in developing countries. Here, we report a separable microneedle (SMN) patch to deliver polymer encapsulated spike (or nucleocapsid) protein encoding DNA vaccines and immune adjuvant for efficient immunization. Compared with intramuscular injection, SMN patch can deliver nanovaccines into intradermal for inducing potent and durable adaptive immunity. IFN-γ+CD4/8+ and IL-2+CD4/8+ T cells or virus specific IgG are significantly increased after vaccination. Moreover, in vivo results show the SMN patches can be stored at room temperature for at least 30 days without decreases in immune responses. These features of nanovaccines-laden SMN patch are important for developing advanced COVID-19 vaccines with global accessibility."
3878,SARS-CoV-2 immunochromatographic IgM/IgG rapid test in pregnancy: A false friend?,"Background: An increasing body of evidence has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women could increase the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted. Therefore, rapid antibody tests have been suggested as an efficient screening tool during pregnancy. Cases: We analysed the clinical performance during pregnancy of a rapid, lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. We performed a universal screening including 169 patients during their last trimester of pregnancy. We present a series of 14 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 immunochromatographic assay rapid test result. Immunochromatographic assay results were always confirmed by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM+IgA antibodies as the gold standard. We observed a positive predictive value of 50% and a false positive rate of 50% in pregnant women, involving a significantly lower diagnostic performance than reported in non-pregnant patients. Discussion: Our data suggest that although immunochromatographic assay rapid tests may be a fast and profitable screening tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they may have a high false positive rate and low positive predictive value in pregnant women. Therefore, immunochromatographic assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies must be verified by other test in pregnant patients."
3879,Survival analysis and influence of the surgical aggression of a cohort of orthopedic and trauma patients in a non-controlled spread COVID-19 scenario.,"Background: Determining the infection rate and mortality probability in healthy patients who have undergone orthopedic and trauma surgeries (OTS) during a period of uncontrolled COVID-19 transmission may help to inform preparations for future waves. This study performed a survival analysis in a cohort of non-infected OTS patients and determined the effect of COVID-19 on mortality. Methods: This observational study included 184 patients who underwent OTS in the month before surgical activities ceased and before the implementation of special measures. Four groups of surgery (GS) were established based on the location of the surgery and the grade of inflammation produced. Crude risk of infection and infection rates were assessed. Survival and failure functions by GS were analyzed. Comparison of the Kaplan-Meier survival curves by GS was assessed. Cox regression and Fine-Gray models were used to determine the effect of different confounders on mortality. Results: The crude risk of COVID-19 diagnosis was 14.13% (95% CI: 9.83-19.90%). The total incidence rate was 2.67 (1000 person-days, 95% CI: 1.74-3.91). At the end of follow-up, there was a 94.42% chance of surviving 76 days or more after OTS. The differences in K-M survivor curves by GS indicated that GS 4 presented a lower survival function (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.024; Wilcoxon-Breslow test, p = 0.044; Tarone-Ware test, p = 0.032). One of the best models to determine the association with mortality was the age-adjusted model for GS, high blood pressure, and respiratory history, with a hazard ratio of 1.112 in Cox regression analysis (95% CI: 1.005-1.230) and a sub hazard ratio of 1.111 (95% CI: 1.046-1.177) in Fine-Gray regression analysis for competitive risk. Conclusions: The infection risk after OTS was similar to that of the general population in a community transmission area; the grade of surgical aggression did not influence this rate. The survival probability was extremely high if patients had not previously been infected. With higher grades of surgical aggression, the risk of mortality was higher in OTS patients. Adjusting for age and other confounders (e.g., GS, high blood pressure and respiratory history) was associated with higher mortality rates."
