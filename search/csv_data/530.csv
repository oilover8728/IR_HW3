5290,Serological investigation of asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals weak and declining antibody responses.,"Without an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the build-up of herd immunity through natural infection has been suggested as a means to control COVID-19. Although population immunity is typically estimated by the serological investigation of recovered patients, humoral immunity in asymptomatic subjects has not been well studied, although they represent a large proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infection cases. In this study, we conducted a serosurvey of asymptomatic infections among food workers and performed serological and cellular response analyses of asymptomatic subjects in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our data showed that up to 5.91% of the food workers carried SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies asymptomatically; however, in 90.4% of them, the antibody level declined over a 2-week period. IgM and IgG antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, were significantly lower in asymptomatic subjects than in recovered symptomatic patients with similar disease courses. Furthermore, the asymptomatic subjects showed lymphopenia and a prominent decrease in the B-cell population, as well as a low frequency of antibody-secreting cells and a low cytokine response. These factors probably contributed to the low and unsustained antibody levels in asymptomatic subjects. Our results show that asymptomatic subjects are likely to be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, and neither the proportion of population immunity nor the breadth of immune responses is sufficient for herd immunity."
5291,Long Noncoding RNAs as Emerging Regulators of COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has high incidence rates with rapid rate of transmission, is a pandemic that spread across the world, resulting in more than 3,000,000 deaths globally. Currently, several drugs have been used for the clinical treatment of COVID-19, such as antivirals (radecivir, baritinib), monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab), and glucocorticoids (dexamethasone). Accumulating evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are essential regulators of virus infections and antiviral immune responses including biological processes that are involved in the regulation of COVID-19 and subsequent disease states. Upon viral infections, cellular lncRNAs directly regulate viral genes and influence viral replication and pathology through virus-mediated changes in the host transcriptome. Additionally, several host lncRNAs could help the occurrence of viral immune escape by inhibiting type I interferons (IFN-1), while others could up-regulate IFN-1 production to play an antiviral role. Consequently, understanding the expression and function of lncRNAs during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will provide insights into the development of lncRNA-based methods. In this review, we summarized the current findings of lncRNAs in the regulation of the strong inflammatory response, immune dysfunction and thrombosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, discussed the underlying mechanisms, and highlighted the therapeutic challenges of COVID-19 treatment and its future research directions."
5292,Epitope-specific antibody responses differentiate COVID-19 outcomes and variants of concern.,"BACKGROUNDThe role of humoral immunity in COVID-19 is not fully understood, owing, in large part, to the complexity of antibodies produced in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a pressing need for serology tests to assess patient-specific antibody response and predict clinical outcome.METHODSUsing SARS-CoV-2 proteome and peptide microarrays, we screened 146 COVID-19 patients' plasma samples to identify antigens and epitopes. This enabled us to develop a master epitope array and an epitope-specific agglutination assay to gauge antibody responses systematically and with high resolution.RESULTSWe identified linear epitopes from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins and showed that the epitopes enabled higher resolution antibody profiling than the S or N protein antigen. Specifically, we found that antibody responses to the S-811-825, S-881-895, and N-156-170 epitopes negatively or positively correlated with clinical severity or patient survival. Moreover, we found that the P681H and S235F mutations associated with the coronavirus variant of concern B.1.1.7 altered the specificity of the corresponding epitopes.CONCLUSIONEpitope-resolved antibody testing not only affords a high-resolution alternative to conventional immunoassays to delineate the complex humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and differentiate between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, but it also may potentially be used to predict clinical outcome. The epitope peptides can be readily modified to detect antibodies against variants of concern in both the peptide array and latex agglutination formats.FUNDINGOntario Research Fund (ORF) COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund, Toronto COVID-19 Action Fund, Western University, Lawson Health Research Institute, London Health Sciences Foundation, and Academic Medical Organization of Southwestern Ontario (AMOSO) Innovation Fund."
5293,Prevalence of Neutralising Antibodies to HCoV-NL63 in Healthy Adults in Australia.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of understanding the immune response to seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV) infections such as HCoV-NL63, how existing neutralising antibodies to HCoV may modulate responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the utility of seasonal HCoV as human challenge models. Therefore, in this study we quantified HCoV-NL63 neutralising antibody titres in a healthy adult population using plasma from 100 blood donors in Australia. A microneutralisation assay was performed with plasma diluted from 1:10 to 1:160 and tested with the HCoV-NL63 Amsterdam-1 strain. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 71% of the plasma samples, with a median geometric mean titre of 14. This titre was similar to those reported in convalescent sera taken from individuals 3-7 months following asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 2-3 years post-infection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-1 patients. HCoV-NL63 neutralising antibody titres decreased with increasing age (R2 = 0.042, p = 0.038), but did not differ by sex. Overall, this study demonstrates that neutralising antibody to HCoV-NL63 is detectable in approximately 71% of the healthy adult population of Australia. Similar titres did not impede the use of another seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in a human challenge model, thus, HCoV-NL63 may be useful as a human challenge model for more pathogenic coronaviruses."
5294,The impact of recent chemotherapy on immunity in 2 COVID-19 cases with gastrointestinal tumors: A case report.,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging infectious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Currently, more than 100 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with over 2.4 million mortalities. The pandemic affects people of all ages but older individuals and those with severe chronic illnesses, including cancer patients, are at higher risk. Patient concerns: The impact of cancer treatment on the progression of COVID-19 is unclear. Therefore, we assessed the effects of chemotherapy on COVID-19 outcomes for 2 cancer patients. On January 24, 2020, a level I response to a major public health emergency was initiated in Hubei Province, China, which includes Enshi Autonomous Prefecture that has a population of 4.026 million people. As of April 30, 2020, 252 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 11 asymptomatic carriers were identified in Enshi. Diagnosis: Among the confirmed cases and asymptomatic carriers, 2 patients were identified who were previously diagnosed with malignant tumors, including one with hepatocellular carcinoma and the other with cardia carcinoma. Interventions: These 2 patients were receiving or just completed chemotherapy at the time of their COVID-19 diagnosis. Outcomes: Both patients were followed and presented favorable outcomes. The positive outcomes for these 2 patients could be partially explained by their recent chemotherapy that impacted their immune status. Also, their relatively younger ages and lack of comorbidities were likely factors in their successful recovery from COVID-19. Conclusions: Anticancer treatment might enhance a patient's ability to respond favorably to COVID-19 infection. However, anticancer treatment is likely to impact immune function differently in different individuals, which can influence disease outcomes."

5296,Oropharyngeal shedding of herpesviruses before and after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination against COVID-19.,"Introduction: Concerns were raised over an increase in Bell's palsy, herpes simplex and herpes zoster after BNT162b2 vaccination, all are manifestations of herpesviruses reactivation. As herpesviruses commonly reactivate in the oropharynx, we have hypothesized that oropharyngeal shedding of herpesviruses will increase after vaccination. Methods: Immune-competent Adults, excluding those using topical steroids or manifesting symptomatic herpesvirus infection, were sampled before BNT162b2 vaccination and one week after. Herpesviruses 1-7 shedding was tested with a multiplexed PCR. Results: In 103 paired samples the prevalence of herpesviruses was similar before and after vaccination: HSV1, 3.9% vs. 5.8% (p = 0.75); HSV2, 0% vs. 1% (p = not applicable, NA); VZV, 0% vs. 0% (p = NA); EBV, 14.6% vs. 17.5% (p = 0.63); CMV, 0% vs. 0% (p = NA); HHV6, 4.9% vs. 7.8% (p = 0.55); HHV7, 71.8% vs. 72.8% (p = 1); any herpesvirus, 73.8% vs. 74.8% (p = 1). Discussion: We did not find evidence for increased oropharyngeal reactivation of herpesviruses one week after BNT162b2."
5297,[Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after COVID-19 vaccination : Neurological and radiological management].,"Background: Vaccine-induced cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (VI-CVST) is a rare complication in recipients of the adenovirus-vectored coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Vaxzevria®; AstraZeneca). Objectives: Development of a diagnostic and therapeutic standard. Materials and methods: Analysis of clinical and basic research findings, expert opinions, and experience with our own cases. Results: VI-CVST usually manifests on day 4-24 after vaccination, mostly in individuals aged < 60 years, and women. In the majority there is an immune pathogenesis caused by antibodies against platelet factor 4/polyanion complexes, leading to thrombotic thrombocytopenia which can result in severe, sometimes fatal, course. The cardinal symptom is headache worsening within days which, however, also can be of variable intensity. Other possible symptoms are seizures, visual disturbance, focal neurological deficits and signs of increased intracranial pressure. If VI-CVST is suspected, the determination of plasma D‑dimer level, platelet count, and screening for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT-2) are essential for treatment decision-making. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with venous MR-angiography is the neuroimaging modality of choice to confirm or exclude VI-CVST. On T2* susceptibility-weighted MRI, the clot in the sinuses or veins produces marked susceptibility artifacts (""blooming""), which also enables the detection of isolated cortical venous thromboses. MRI/MR-angiography or computed tomography (CT)/CT-angiography usually allow-in combination with clinical and laboratory findings-reliable diagnosis of VI-CVST. Conclusions: The clinical suspicion of VI-CVST calls for urgent laboratory and neuroimaging workup. In the presence of thrombocytopenia and/or pathogenic antibodies, specific medications for anticoagulation and immunomodulation are recommended."
5298,Perspectives on COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women in South Africa.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has created a global health crisis and upended conventional methodologies, both in the governance and clinical structures of Health Care Systems. The spread of COVID-19 has necessitated a coordinated public health response in an effective, extensive and expedited vaccination rollout strategy with the ultimate aim of limiting all nidi of infection for the pathogen. For this goal to be realised, pregnant women, as a cohort, cannot reasonably be excluded from this initiative, despite the initial reluctance to include them in clinical trials for various ethical and legal reasons. Weighing the detrimental complications of COVID-19 on maternal and perinatal outcomes against the hypothetical risk of vaccination in the context of promising, albeit indirect, safety and efficacy data, this report argues that all pregnant women should be offered the choice of whether or not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine based on the available evidence and their individualised risk-benefit ratio."
5299,Our anesthesia experiences in COVID-19 positive patients delivering by cesarean section: A retrospective single-center cohort study.,"Aim: Pregnancy increases susceptibility to respiratory complications of viral diseases. This study aims to evaluate our anesthesia practices in pregnant women with COVID-19 undergoing cesarean section. Methods: A total of 61 patients who underwent cesarean section and had positive Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for COVID-19 with nasopharyngeal swabs were included in the study. Patient demographics and information about anesthesia were analyzed retrospectively from the patient medical files. Results: A total of 61 parturients undergoing cesarean section that had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were assessed. General anesthesia was applied to only three patients (4.9%), while spinal anesthesia was administered to the remaining 58 patients (95.1%). The incidence of hypotension was 25.9% in the spinal anesthesia group. Forty-one (67.2%) parturients were asymptomatic. While the rate of pneumonia in symptomatic patients was 45% (9/20), the pneumonia incidence among all SARS-CoV-2 PCR (+) parturients was 14% (9/61). Three (4.9%) COVID-19 patients required intensive care in the perioperative period. The overall mortality rate was 1.6% (1/61) among parturients with COVID-19 undergoing cesarean section, while it was 11.1% (1/9) in patients with pneumonia. Conclusion: It was observed that COVID-19 is associated with mortality in pregnant women undergoing cesarean section. Spinal anesthesia was safely and effectively administered in COVID-19 parturients, especially in patients with pneumonia."
