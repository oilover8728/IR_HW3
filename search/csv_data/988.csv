9870,Peripheral Nervous System Manifestations Associated with COVID-19.,"Purpose of review: The present review discusses the peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recent findings: Nerve pain and skeletal muscle injury, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, cranial polyneuritis, neuromuscular junction disorders, neuro-ophthalmological disorders, neurosensory hearing loss, and dysautonomia have been reported as PNS manifestations in patients with COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19. COVID-19 has shown syndromic complexity. Not only does SARS-CoV-2 affect the central nervous system but also it involves the PNS. The PNS involvement may be due to dysregulation of the immune system attributable to COVID-19. Here we review the broad spectrum of PNS involvement of COVID-19."

9873,A single subcutaneous or intranasal immunization with adenovirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.,"Optimal vaccines are needed for sustained suppression of SARS-CoV-2 and other novel coronaviruses. Here, we developed a recombinant type 5 adenovirus vector encoding the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit antigen (Ad5.SARS-CoV-2-S1) for COVID-19 immunization and evaluated its immunogenicity in mice. A single immunization with Ad5.SARS-CoV-2-S1 via S.C. injection or I.N delivery induced robust antibody and cellular immune responses. Vaccination elicited significant S1-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a endpoint titers as early as 2 weeks, and the induced antibodies were long lasting. I.N. and S.C. administration of Ad5.SARS-CoV-2-S1 produced S1-specific GC B cells in cervical and axillary LNs, respectively. Moreover, I.N. and S.C. immunization evoked significantly greater antigen-specific T-cell responses compared to unimmunized control groups with indications that S.C. injection was more effective than I.N. delivery in eliciting cellular immune responses. Mice vaccinated by either route demonstrated significantly increased virus-specific neutralization antibodies on weeks 8 and 12 compared to control groups, as well as BM antibody forming cells (AFC), indicative of long-term immunity. Thus, this Ad5-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate showed promising immunogenicity following delivery to mice by S.C. and I.N. routes of administration, supporting the further development of Ad-based vaccines against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases for sustainable global immunization programs."

9876,[A surveillance system to detect COVID-19 infections in health care workers. Experience in 209 cases].,"Background: Healthcare personnel are a high-risk group for acquiring COVID-19 disease. They represent 4 to 20% of the total number of cases reported in different geographical areas. Aim: To describe an epidemiological surveillance strategy to detect symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection and early case detection among healthcare personnel at a university hospital. Patients and methods: We assessed 209 healthcare workers reporting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in a telephone counseling system. After a structured evaluation, the suggestions ranged from having a SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR test, consulting in the emergency room or at outpatient clinic or returning to work. Results: In 61% of assessed workers a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR was requested and 28 (22%) were positive. In a multivariate analysis, the clinical variables associated with a positive PCR test were the presence of fever, sudden loss of smell or taste, and a history of contact with a COVID-19 positive case. Conclusions: The telephone symptom monitoring program allowed the early detection of a significant number of healthcare officials with acute respiratory infection due to coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, it is easy to implement and has a low cost."
9877,Identification of candidate repurposable drugs to combat COVID-19 using a signature-based approach.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than other coronaviruses and has higher rates of mortality than influenza. Identification of effective therapeutics is a crucial tool to treat those infected with SARS-CoV-2 and limit the spread of this novel disease globally. We deployed a bioinformatics workflow to identify candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Using an ""omics"" repository, the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), we simultaneously probed transcriptomic signatures of putative COVID-19 drugs and publicly available SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines to identify novel therapeutics. We identified a shortlist of 20 candidate drugs: 8 are already under trial for the treatment of COVID-19, the remaining 12 have antiviral properties and 6 have antiviral efficacy against coronaviruses specifically, in vitro. All candidate drugs are either FDA approved or are under investigation. Our candidate drug findings are discordant with (i.e., reverse) SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome signatures generated in vitro, and a subset are also identified in transcriptome signatures generated from COVID-19 patient samples, like the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. Overall, our findings provide additional support for drugs that are already being explored as therapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and identify promising novel targets that are worthy of further investigation."

To explore the transmission advantage, we estimate that the N501Y substitution increases the infectivity by 52% (95% confidence interval: 46, 58) in terms of the reproduction number."
