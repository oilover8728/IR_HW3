1480,Head-to-head validation of six immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients.,"Background: Detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may help to diagnose COVID-19. Head-to-head validation of different types of immunoassays in well-characterized cohorts of hospitalized patients remains needed. Methods: We validated three chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs) (Liaison, Elecsys, and Abbott) and one single molecule array assay (SIMOA) (Quanterix) for automated analyzers, one rapid immunoassay RIA (AllTest), and one ELISA (Wantai) in parallel in first samples from 126 PCR confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients and 158 pre-COVID-19 patients. Specificity of the AllTest was also tested in 106 patients with confirmed parasitic and dengue virus infections. Specificity of the Wantai assay was not tested due to limitations in sample volumes. Results: Overall sensitivity in first samples was 70.6 % for the Liaison, 71.4 % for the Elecsys, 75.4 % for the Abbott, 70.6 % for the Quanterix, 77.8 % for the AllTest, and 88.9 % for the Wantai assay, respectively. Sensitivity was between 77.4 % (Liaison) and 94.0 % (Wantai) after 10 dpso. No false positive results were observed for the Elecsys and Abbott assays. Specificity was 91.1 % for the Quanterix, 96.2 % for the Liaison, and 98.1 % for the AllTest assay, respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that low sensitivity of all immunoassays limits their use early after onset of illness in diagnosing COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. After 10 dpso, the Wantai ELISA has a relatively high sensitivity, followed by the point-of-care AllTest RIA that compares favorably with automated analyzer immunoassays."
1481,Guidelines for Laboratory Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Korea.,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which began in December 2019, is still ongoing in Korea, with >9,000 confirmed cases as of March 25, 2020. COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR is currently the most reliable diagnostic method for COVID-19 around the world. Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine and the Korea Centers for Disease Prevention and Control propose guidelines for diagnosing COVID-19 in clinical laboratories in Korea. These guidelines are based on other related domestic and international guidelines, as well as expert opinions and include the selection of test subjects, selection of specimens, diagnostic methods, interpretation of test results, and biosafety."
1482,Selecting COVID-19 convalescent plasma for neutralizing antibody potency using a high-capacity SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay.,"Background: Efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is hypothesized to be associated with the concentration of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to SARS-CoV-2. High capacity serologic assays detecting binding antibodies (bAb) have been developed; nAb assays are not adaptable to high-throughput testing. We sought to determine the effectiveness of using surrogate bAb signal-to-cutoff ratios (S/Co) in predicting nAb titers using a pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay. Methods: CCP donor serum collected by three US blood collectors was tested with a bAb assay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total, CoV2T) and a nAb RVPN assay. Prediction effectiveness of various CoV2T S/Co criteria was evaluated for RVPN nAb NT50 titers using receiver operating characteristics. Results: Seven hundred and fifty-three CCPs were tested with median CoV2T S/Co and NT50 of 71.2 of 527.5. Proportions of donors with NT50 over target nAb titers were 86% ≥1:80, 76% ≥1:160, and 62% ≥1:320. Increasing CoV2T S/Co criterion reduced the sensitivity to predict NT50 titers, while specificity to identify those below increased. As target NT50 titers increase, the CoV2T assay becomes less accurate as a predictor with a decline in positive predictive value and rise in negative predictive value. Conclusion: Selection of a clinically effective nAb titer will impact availability of CCP. Product release with CoV2T assay S/Co criterion must balance the risk of releasing products below target nAb titers with the cost of false negatives. A two-step testing scheme may be optimal, with nAb testing on CoV2T samples with S/Cos below criterion."
1483,Antibody Status and Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Health Care Workers.,"Background: The relationship between the presence of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the risk of subsequent reinfection remains unclear. Methods: We investigated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seropositive and seronegative health care workers attending testing of asymptomatic and symptomatic staff at Oxford University Hospitals in the United Kingdom. Baseline antibody status was determined by anti-spike (primary analysis) and anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays, and staff members were followed for up to 31 weeks. We estimated the relative incidence of PCR-positive test results and new symptomatic infection according to antibody status, adjusting for age, participant-reported gender, and changes in incidence over time. Results: A total of 12,541 health care workers participated and had anti-spike IgG measured; 11,364 were followed up after negative antibody results and 1265 after positive results, including 88 in whom seroconversion occurred during follow-up. A total of 223 anti-spike-seronegative health care workers had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10,000 days at risk), 100 during screening while they were asymptomatic and 123 while symptomatic, whereas 2 anti-spike-seropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10,000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when tested (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.44; P = 0.002). There were no symptomatic infections in workers with anti-spike antibodies. Rate ratios were similar when the anti-nucleocapsid IgG assay was used alone or in combination with the anti-spike IgG assay to determine baseline status. Conclusions: The presence of anti-spike or anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibodies was associated with a substantially reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the ensuing 6 months.

1485,COVID-19 Infection: Targeting Possibilities for Treatment.,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus (nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has posed an international public health emergency worldwide and forced people to be confined in their homes. This virus is of high-risk category and is declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The worldwide researchers and various health professionals are working together to determine the best way to stop its spread or halt this virus's spread and circumvent this pandemic condition threatening millions of human lives. The absence of definitive treatment is possible to explore to reduce virus infection and enhance patient recovery. Along with off-label medicines, plasma therapy, vaccines, the researchers exploit the various plants/herbs and their constituents to effectively treat nCoV infection. The present study aimed to present brief and most informative salient features of the numerous facts regarding the SARS-CoV-2, including the structure, genomic sequence, recent mutation, targeting possibility, and various hurdles in research progress, and off-labeled drugs, convalescent plasma therapy, vaccine and plants/herbs for the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Results showed that off-labeled drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, antiviral drug (remdesivir, favipiravir), etc., give positive results and approved for use or approved for restricted use in some countries like India. Future research should focus on these possibilities that may allow the development of an effective treatment for COVID-19."
1486,Egypt's COVID-19 Recent Happenings and Perspectives: A Mini-Review.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected countries across the world. While the zoonotic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 are still under investigation, bats and pangolins are currently cited as the animal origin of the virus. Several types of vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed and are being used in vaccination drives across the world. A number of countries are experiencing second and third waves of the pandemic, which have claimed nearly four million lives out of the 180 million people infected globally as of June 2021. The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and mutants are posing high public health concerns owing to their rapid transmissibility, higher severity, and in some cases, ability to infect vaccinated people (vaccine breakthrough). Here in this mini-review, we specifically looked at the efforts and actions of the Egyptian government to slow down and control the spread of COVID-19. We also review the COVID-19 statistics in Egypt and the possible reasons behind the low prevalence and high case fatality rate (CFR%), comparing Egypt COVID-19 statistics with China (the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic) and the USA, Brazil, India, Italy, and France (the first countries in which the numbers of patients infected with COVID-19). Additionally, we have summarized the SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccines used in Egypt, and the use of medicinal plants as preventive and curative options."
1487,Efficient Identification of High-Titer Anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Antibody Plasma Samples by Pooling Method.,"Context.—: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has elicited a surge in demand for serologic testing to identify previously infected individuals. In particular, antibody testing is crucial in identifying COVID-19 convalescent plasma, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization for use as passive immunotherapy for hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19. Currently, high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma can be qualified by Ortho's Vitros COVID-19 IgG antibody test. Objective.—: To explore the use of an efficient testing method to identify high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma for use in treating COVID-19-infected patients and track COVID-19 positivity over time. Design.—: We evaluated an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based method that detects antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with individual and pooled plasma samples and compared its performance against the Vitros COVID-19 IgG antibody test. Using the pooled RBD-ELISA (P-RE) method, we also screened more than 10 000 longitudinal healthy blood donor samples to assess seroprevalence. Results.—: P-RE demonstrates 100% sensitivity in detecting Food and Drug Administration-defined high-titer samples when compared with the Vitros COVID-19 IgG antibody test. Overall sensitivity of P-RE when compared with the Vitros COVID-19 IgG antibody test and our individual sample RBD-ELISA (I-RE) were 83% and 56%, respectively. When screening 10 218 healthy blood donor samples by P-RE, we found the seroprevalence correlated with the local infection rates with a correlation coefficient of 0.21 (P < .001). Conclusions.—: Pooling plasma samples can be used to efficiently screen large populations for individuals with high-titer anti-RBD antibodies, important for COVID-19 convalescent plasma identification."

1489,Comparative Clinical Evaluation of the Roche Elecsys and Abbott Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Serology Assays for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Context.—: The use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologic tests detects antibodies in the host, contributing to the identification of individuals who have been exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective.—: To critically evaluate 2 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serology tests. Design.—: A total of 333 unique, nonduplicated serum samples obtained from COVID-19 patients (n = 170) and negative controls (n = 163) obtained before December 2019 were used in the study. Samples were tested on the Roche E411 and Abbott Architect i4000SR platforms, and results were correlated to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results and clinical symptoms. Results.—: There was a strong level of agreement in the qualitative results between both assays, with a Cohen κ value of .840, P < .001. The specificity for both Roche and Abbott were excellent at 100%. Roche exhibited marginally better performance in the 21 days or more group with a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% CI, 75.8%-96.8%) versus an Abbott sensitivity of 84.4% (95% CI, 68.3%-93.1%), as well as in the 14- to 20-day group with a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI, 65.4%-95.0%) versus an Abbott sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI, 60.0%-92.3%). Less than 14 days of symptoms groups exhibited poor sensitivity at less than 50% for both assays. The areas under curve (± standard error) for Roche (0.894 ± 0.025, P < .001) and Abbott (0.884 ± 0.026, P < .001) were very similar. Potential confounders for negative serologic results include antiretroviral medication use and pauci-symptomatic patients. Conclusions.—: Specificities for high-throughput Roche and Abbott immunoassays are excellent, but users need to be cautious to interpret serologic test results after 14 days of symptoms to avoid false negatives."
