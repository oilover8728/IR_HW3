7410,DCs-based therapies: potential strategies in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Pneumonia caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading globally. There have been strenuous efforts to reveal the mechanisms that the host defends itself against invasion by this virus. The immune system could play a crucial role in virus infection. Dendritic cell as sentinel of the immune system plays an irreplaceable role. Dendritic cells-based therapeutic approach may be a potential strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, the characteristics of coronavirus are described briefly. We focus on the essential functions of dendritic cell in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Basis of treatment based dendritic cells to combat coronavirus infections is summarized. Finally, we propose that the combination of DCs based vaccine and other therapy is worth further study."
7411,No SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in the convalescent plasma of COVID-19 patients with different disease severity.,"Introduction: Convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT), a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), requires strict quality control of the donor blood. Whether to confirm the disappearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA (RNAemia) in convalescent donor blood or not is unclear. Reports recommending the proof of viral disappearance from the blood are controversial. Foreseeing CPT in treating COVID-19 patients in Japan, we investigated RNAemia in 100 convalescent donors with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. Methods: Between April 30 and July 30, 2020, we measured RNAemia in the plasma samples of donors with resolved COVID-19. Data on patients' demographics, comorbidities, pneumonia, treatment, and real-time polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2 were collected. Date of onset of initial symptoms or date of positive testing (for asymptomatic patients) were self-reported by the patients. Disease severity was defined as: no, mild, moderate oxygen demand, or severe (requiring mechanical ventilation). Results: Of 100 donors (58 males [58.0%]; median age, 47 [range 22-69] years) screened as of July 30, 2020, 77 (77.0%); 19 (19.0%); and 4 (4.0%) had mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Median time between onset and testing was 68.5 (range, 21-167) days. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any of the plasma samples. Conclusion: RNAemia was not found in recovered COVID-19 patients at least 21, 27, and 57 days after the onset of mild, moderate, and severe symptoms. Our study may contribute to determining a suitable time for collecting convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients and to future CPT use."
7412,Systemic innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 as it relates to other coronaviruses.,"The deadly pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents one of the greatest threats humanity has faced in the last century. Infection with this easily transmissible virus can run the gamut from asymptomatic to fatal, and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). What little research that has already been conducted implicates pathological responses by the immune system as the leading culprit responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19. In this review we will summarize what is currently known about the systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and potential immunotherapeutic approaches."
7413,Genetic Aspects and Immune Responses in Covid-19: Important Organ Involvement.,"In the last two decades, the world has experienced outbreaks of three major coronaviruses with high morbidity and mortality rates. The most recent of these started in the form of an unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and now the world is facing a serious pandemic. This new disease has been called COVID-19 and is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Understanding the specific genetic and phenotypic structure of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis is vital in finding appropriate drugs and vaccines. With this in mind, this review sheds light on the virology, genetics, immune-responses, and mechanism of action of this virus."
7414,Emergence of genomic diversity and recurrent mutations in SARS-CoV-2.,"SARS-CoV-2 is a SARS-like coronavirus of likely zoonotic origin first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. The virus has since spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first whole genome sequence was published on January 5 2020, and thousands of genomes have been sequenced since this date. This resource allows unprecedented insights into the past demography of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the virus is adapting to its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and vaccine design. We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over time. Our results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host. Due to extensive transmission, the genetic diversity of the virus in several countries recapitulates a large fraction of its worldwide genetic diversity. We identify regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have remained largely invariant to date, and others that have already accumulated diversity. By focusing on mutations which have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of recurrent mutations (>15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are of particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. We additionally provide an interactive user-friendly web-application to query the alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes."
7415,Tracheal swab from front of neck airway for SARS-CoV-2; a bronchial foreign body.,"We report the case of a bronchial foreign body, following a tracheostomy site swab for SARS-CoV-2, aiming to raise awareness and vigilance. A qualified nurse was performing a routine SARS-CoV-2 swab on a 51-year-old woman, fitted with a tracheostomy in the recent past following a craniotomy. This was part of the discharging protocol to a nursing home. During the sampling, part of the swab stylet snapped and was inadvertently dropped through the tracheostomy site. Initial CT imaging was reported as showing no signs of a foreign body but some inflammatory changes. Bedside flexible endoscopy through the tracheostomy site revealed the swab in a right lobar bronchus. This was subsequently removed by flexible bronchoscopy. This case highlights the need for clear guidance on how samples for SARS-CoV-2 are taken from patients with front of neck airways (laryngectomy/tracheÎ¿stomy) and the potential pitfalls involved."
7416,"Risk for SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Healthcare Workers, Turin, Italy.","We measured severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein subunits S1/S2 antibodies by using capillary electrophoresis and a chemiluminescence immunoassay for 5,444 active healthcare workers in Italy. Seroprevalence was 6.9% and higher among participants having contact with patients. Seroconversion was not observed in 37/213 previously infected participants."
7417,ConceptWAS: A high-throughput method for early identification of COVID-19 presenting symptoms and characteristics from clinical notes.,"Objective: Identifying symptoms and characteristics highly specific to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would improve the clinical and public health response to this pandemic challenge. Here, we describe a high-throughput approach - Concept-Wide Association Study (ConceptWAS) - that systematically scans a disease's clinical manifestations from clinical notes. We used this method to identify symptoms specific to COVID-19 early in the course of the pandemic. Methods: We created a natural language processing pipeline to extract concepts from clinical notes in a local ER corresponding to the PCR testing date for patients who had a COVID-19 test and evaluated these concepts as predictors for developing COVID-19. We identified predictors from Firth's logistic regression adjusted by age, gender, and race. We also performed ConceptWAS using cumulative data every two weeks to identify the timeline for recognition of early COVID-19-specific symptoms. Results: We processed 87,753 notes from 19,692 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR testing between March 8, 2020, and May 27, 2020 (1,483 COVID-19-positive). We found 68 concepts significantly associated with a positive COVID-19 test. We identified symptoms associated with increasing risk of COVID-19, including ""anosmia"" (odds ratio [OR] = 4.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.21-7.50), ""fever"" (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.28-1.59), ""cough with fever"" (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.75-2.96), and ""ageusia"" (OR = 5.18, 95% CI = 3.02-8.58). Using ConceptWAS, we were able to detect loss of smell and loss of taste three weeks prior to their inclusion as symptoms of the disease by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Conclusion: ConceptWAS, a high-throughput approach for exploring specific symptoms and characteristics of a disease like COVID-19, offers a promise for enabling EHR-powered early disease manifestations identification."

7419,COVID-19 testing strategy in response to infection among healthcare workers in a large non-COVID-designated hospital.,"Sarawak General Hospital, which is the only public access tertiary referral center in Sarawak State for all clinical specialties, was designated a hybrid hospital to treat both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. During the initial surge of patients admitted with COVID-19, there was also a corresponding increase in health-care workers (HCWs) detected with COVID-19 infection. The latter being isolated, and the large number of staff members that had come into contact with COVID-19 being quarantined from work, placed further strain on the health-care services. The staff mass screening strategy was a policy decision made by the hospital in response to infection among HCWs, and it aimed to reduce in-hospital transmission (particularly among asymptomatic staff), mitigate workforce depletion due to quarantining, and protect the health-care workforce. In this study, we assessed the detection rate of COVID-19 infection from staff mass testing over a five-week period, and described our experience of adopting this surveillance screening strategy alongside ongoing contact tracing and symptomatic screening strategies. Although it was thought that such periodic staff surveillance might be helpful in protecting the health-care workforce within a short period, the long-term implications, especially in settings with limited resources, is significant and therefore explored in this paper. Our findings might provide an evidence-based reference for the future planning of an optimal strategy with the least compromise in care for a larger proportion of non-COVID-19 patients amid efforts against COVID-19 in a large non-COVID-designated hospital with hybrid status."
