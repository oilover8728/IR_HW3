890,"Role of presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19: evidence from Beijing, China.","Background: The presymptomatic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been documented in limited clusters, and it is predicted through modelling. However, there is a lack of evidence from observations with a large sample size. Methods: We used data from meticulous contact tracing of people exposed to cases of SARS-CoV-2 to estimate the proportion of cases that result from the presymptomatic transmission of the virus in Beijing during January 2020 and February 2020. Results: The results showed that presymptomatic transmission occurred in at least 15% of 100 secondary COVID-19 cases. The earliest presymptomatic contact event occurred 5 days prior to the index case's onset of symptoms, and this occurred in two clusters. Conclusions: The finding suggested that the contact tracing period should be earlier and highlighted the importance of preventing transmission opportunities well before the onset of symptoms."
891,Comparison of Two Automated Immunoassays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Antibodies.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel member of the coronavirus family that caused the global coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The prevalence remains largely unknown because of early testing supply shortages. Although it cannot currently be used to determine level of immunity, antibody testing can contribute to epidemiological studies, identify convalescent plasma donors, or satisfy curiosity about previous exposure to the virus. Methods: 407 samples collected from hospitalized inpatients with and without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 170 remnant clinical specimens collected and frozen prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and paired serum and plasma samples from 23 convalescent plasma donors were used to determine performance characteristics of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays. The sensitivity, specificity, imprecision, interferences, and sample stability were determined. These assays were then used to characterize the antibody response in serial samples from 20 SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients. Results: Both assays exhibited 100% specificity (95% CI; 99.05-100.00), giving no positive results in 170 specimens collected before July 2019 and 215 specimens from patients without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differences between platforms were most notable in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Roche offered higher sensitivity in convalescent plasma donors at 95.7% (95% CI; 78.1-99.9) versus 91.3% (95% CI; 72.0-98.9) but Abbott detected antibodies in 2 immunocompromised patients whereas Roche did not. The Roche and Abbott platforms also exhibited different trends in antibody signal for a subset of patients. Conclusions: Both the Abbott and Roche platforms offer excellent specificity but different trends in antibody signal may reflect qualitative differences in the types of antibodies recognized by the 2 assays. Negative serologic results do not exclude previous SARS-CoV-2 infection."
892,On Setting Expectations for a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Vaccine.,"The global coronavirus pandemic is unlike any other since 1918. A century of dramatic medical advances has produced a public expectation that the medical field will rapidly provide solutions to restore normalcy. In less than 6 months, since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified, the massive international effort to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has generated more than 140 vaccines in different stages of development, with 9 already recruiting into clinical trials posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. The long-term strategy to handle coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will almost certainly rely on vaccines. But what type of protection can we realistically expect to achieve from vaccines and when?"
893,Nucleic Acid-Based Technologies Targeting Coronaviruses.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently creating a global health emergency. This crisis is driving a worldwide effort to develop effective vaccines, prophylactics, and therapeutics. Nucleic acid (NA)-based treatments hold great potential to combat outbreaks of coronaviruses (CoVs) due to their rapid development, high target specificity, and the capacity to increase druggability. Here, we review key anti-CoV NA-based technologies, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), siRNAs, RNA-targeting clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas), and mRNA vaccines, and discuss improved delivery methods and combination therapies with other antiviral drugs."
894,Isolation and characterization of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant in travellers from the United Kingdom to India: VUI-202012/01 of the B.1.1.7 lineage.,We have isolated the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 variant of concern 202 012/01 from the positive coronavirus disease 2019 cases that travelled from the UK to India in the month of December 2020. This emphasizes the need for the strengthened surveillance system to limit the local transmission of this new variant.
895,Practical strategies for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in resource-constrained settings.,"Alternatives to nasopharyngeal sampling are needed to increase capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Among 275 participants, we piloted the collection of nasal mid-turbinate swabs amenable to self-testing, including polyester flocked swabs as well as 3D-printed plastic lattice swabs, placed into viral transport media or an RNA stabilization agent. Flocked nasal swabs identified 104/121 individuals who were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal sampling (sensitivity 87%, 95% CI 79-92%), missing those with low viral load (<106 viral copies/mL). 3D-printed nasal swabs showed similar sensitivity. When nasal swabs were placed directly into RNA preservative, the mean 1.4 log decrease in viral copies/uL compared to nasopharyngeal samples was reduced to <1 log, even when samples were left at room temperature for up to 7 days. We also evaluated pooling strategies that involved pooling specimens in the lab versus pooling swabs at the point of collection, finding both successfully detected samples with >105 viral copies/mL."
896,Exploring the multifocal therapeutic approaches in COVID-19: A ray of hope.,"The ongoing global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is marked as one of the most challenging infectious diseases in the history of mankind with affliction of ~29,737,453 confirmed cases globally. Looking at the present scenario where there is a parallel increment in curve with time, there is an utmost emergency to discover a perennial solution to this life-threatening virus which has led the Human race in an unusual state of affair. The entire health care fraternity is engaged in endeavouring an ultimate way out to hit this pandemic but no such research made till now has been approved yet, to have the potential to bring an end to this fatal situation. Although a few possible treatment choices exist at the moment yet the requirement to search for a still better therapeutic option remains persistent. Global laboratories are working day and night in search for an effective vaccine, many are undergoing clinical trials but their commercialization is no less than a year away. The present review highlights the current potential therapies viz., vaccines, immunotherapies, convulsant plasma therapies, corticosteroids, antithrombotic, intravenous immunoglobulins, nocturnal oxygen therapy etc. that may prove beneficial in attenuating the pandemic situation. However, comparison and presentation of collective data on the therapeutic advancements in mitigating the pandemic situation needs further clinical investigations in order to prove boon to mankind."
897,Same pandemic but different studies: an exploration of COVID-19 research at the early stage.,"Objective: Scientific research is an essential necessity for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Accelerated paper-sharing makes it possible to explore the responses of scientific communities of different countries and their research focus. This is achieved by examining relevant publications during the early stage of the pandemic. This paper explores a timely research assessment on COVID-19 among China, USA, and EU. Materials and methods: Papers indexed in PubMed and published from December 30, 2019, to March 11, 2020, were selected. Papers from China, USA, and EU were assessed by calculating the significance of items in the co-occurrence exported from VOSviewer. Results: The results showed that Chinese studies focus more on clinical manifestations, while USA and EU focus on experimental research. Furthermore, US research is more geared toward detection techniques and mathematical models, China focuses more on monitoring the epidemic situation, and EU engages in both. Conclusions: This paper argues that the above distinctions are caused by differences in the stages of epidemic development, researchers' experience bases for formulating measures, traditions within the different medical cultures, and the distinction between ""information"" and ""knowledge""."
