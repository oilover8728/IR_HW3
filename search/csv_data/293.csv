2920,The Science is There: Key Considerations for Stabilizing Viral Vector-Based Covid-19 Vaccines.,"Once Covid-19 vaccines become available, 5-10 billion vaccine doses should be globally distributed, stored and administered. In this commentary, we discuss how this enormous challenge could be addressed for viral vector-based Covid-19 vaccines by learning from the wealth of formulation development experience gained over the years on stability issues related to live attenuated virus vaccines and viral vector vaccines for other diseases. This experience has led -over time- to major improvements on storage temperature, shelf-life and in-use stability requirements. First, we will cover work on 'classical' live attenuated virus vaccines as well as replication competent viral vector vaccines. Subsequently, we address replication deficient viral vector vaccines. Freeze drying and storage at 2-8 °C with a shelf life of years has become the norm. In the case of pandemics with incredibly high and urgent product demands, however, the desire for rapid and convenient distribution chains combined with short end-user storage times require that liquid formulations with shelf lives of months stored at 2-8 °C be considered. In confronting this ""perfect storm"" of Covid-19 vaccine stability challenges, understanding the many lessons learned from decades of development and manufacturing of live virus-based vaccines is the shortest path for finding promising and rapid solutions."

2922,A Review on SERS-Based Detection of Human Virus Infections: Influenza and Coronavirus.,"The diagnosis of respiratory viruses of zoonotic origin (RVsZO) such as influenza and coronaviruses in humans is crucial, because their spread and pandemic threat are the highest. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an analytical technique with promising impact for the point-of-care diagnosis of viruses. It has been applied to a variety of influenza A virus subtypes, such as the H1N1 and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this work, a review of the strategies used for the detection of RVsZO by SERS is presented. In addition, relevant information about the SERS technique, anthropozoonosis, and RVsZO is provided for a better understanding of the theme. The direct identification is based on trapping the viruses within the interstices of plasmonic nanoparticles and recording the SERS signal from gene fragments or membrane proteins. Quantitative mono- and multiplexed assays have been achieved following an indirect format through a SERS-based sandwich immunoassay. Based on this review, the development of multiplex assays that incorporate the detection of RVsZO together with their specific biomarkers and/or secondary disease biomarkers resulting from the infection progress would be desirable. These configurations could be used as a double confirmation or to evaluate the health condition of the patient."

2924,Seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Northern Serbia (Vojvodina): A four consecutive sentinel population-based survey study.,"Background: Monitoring changes of seroprevalence over time is important at the beginning and during of COVID-19 outbreak to anticipate its dynamics and plan an adequate public health response. Methods: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional investigation among asymptomatic outpatient subjects and covered 0.1% of total population of Northern Serbia (Autonomous Province of Vojvodina). Each participant was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using an immunochromatographic qualitative test (point-of-care rapid test). In the last round of survey IgG antibodies targeting the S1 subunit of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus were assessed. Results: During the four rounds of survey (between the end of April and the end of September), anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivities based on immunochromatographic test results were 2.60% (95% CI 1.80-3.63), 3.93% (95% CI 2.85-5.28), 6.11% (95% CI 4.72-7.77) and 14.60% (95% 12.51-16.89), respectively. After adjusting with results obtained from the Line immunoassay test, the estimated overall seroprevalence increased to 16.67% (95% CI 14.45-19.08) corresponding to 322,033 infections in total by the end of September 2020 in Vojvodina's population. Throughout the course of the study, for every RT-PCR confirmed case of COVID-19, there were 39-87 additional infections in Vojvodina. No significant difference (p>0.05) in SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity regarding gender and between age subgroups was observed over the course of the survey. Conclusions: The population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies implies much more widespread infection in Vojvodina than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. However, our results suggest that the population of Vojvodina has not reached a desirable level of protection from SARS-CoV-2 virus by the end of September 2020."

2926,Ultrasensitive Measurement of Both SARS-CoV-2 RNA and Antibodies from Saliva.,"Tests for COVID-19 generally measure SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from nasal swabs or antibodies against the virus from blood. It has been shown, however, that both viral particles and antibodies against those particles are present in saliva, which is more accessible than both swabs and blood. We present methods for highly sensitive measurements of both viral RNA and antibodies from the same saliva sample. We developed an efficient saliva RNA extraction method and combined it with an ultrasensitive antibody test based on single molecule array (Simoa) technology. We apply our test to the saliva of patients who presented to the hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, some of whom tested positive with a conventional RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal swab test. We demonstrate that combining viral RNA detection by RT-qPCR with antibody detection by Simoa identifies more patients as infected than either method alone. Our results demonstrate the utility of combining viral RNA and antibody testing from saliva, a single easily accessible biofluid."

2929,Do we know the diagnostic properties of the tests used in COVID-19? A rapid review of recently published literature.,"COVID-19 has brought death and disease to large parts of the world. Governments must deploy strategies to screen the population and subsequently isolate the suspect cases. Diagnostic testing is critical for epidemiological surveillance, but the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and clinical utility (impact on health outcomes) of the current diagnostic methods used for SARS-CoV-2 detection are not known. I ran a quick search in PubMed/MEDLINE to find studies on laboratory diagnostic tests and rapid viral diagnosis. After running the search strategies, I found 47 eligible articles that I discuss in this review, commenting on test characteristics and limitations. I did not find any papers that report on the clinical utility of the tests currently used for COVID-19 detection, meaning that we are fighting a battle without proper knowledge of the proportion of false negatives that current testing is resulting in. This shortcoming should not be overlooked as it might hamper national efforts to contain the pandemic through testing community-based suspect cases."
