1431,Quantitative Measurement of IgG to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Proteins Using ImmunoCAP.,"Background: Detailed understanding of the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (CO-VID-19) has been hampered by a lack of quantitative antibody assays. Objective: The objective was to develop a quantitative assay for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 proteins that could be implemented in clinical and research laboratories. Methods: The biotin-streptavidin technique was used to conjugate SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) or nucleocapsid protein to the solid phase of the ImmunoCAP. Plasma and serum samples from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 60) and samples from donors banked before the emergence of COVID-19 (n = 109) were used in the assay. SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were followed longitudinally in a subset of samples and were related to total IgG and IgG to reference antigens using an ImmunoCAP 250 platform. Results: At a cutoff of 2.5 μg/mL, the assay demonstrated sensitivity and specificity exceeding 95% for IgG to both SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Among 36 patients evaluated in a post-hospital follow-up clinic, median levels of IgG to spike-RBD and nucleocapsid were 34.7 μg/mL (IQR 18-52) and 24.5 μg/mL (IQR 9-59), respectively. Among 17 patients with longitudinal samples, there was a wide variation in the magnitude of IgG responses, but generally the response to spike-RBD and to nucleocapsid occurred in parallel, with peak levels approaching 100 μg/mL, or 1% of total IgG. Conclusions: We have described a quantitative assay to measure IgG to SARS-CoV-2 that could be used in clinical and research laboratories and implemented at scale. The assay can easily be adapted to measure IgG to mutated COVID-19 proteins, has good performance characteristics, and has a readout in standardized units."

1433,"Aging in COVID-19: Vulnerability, immunity and intervention.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, moved across the globe at an unprecedented speed, and is having a profound and yet still unfolding health and socioeconomic impacts. SARS-CoV-2, a β-coronavirus, is a highly contagious respiratory pathogen that causes a disease that has been termed the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Clinical experience thus far indicates that COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous, ranging from being asymptomatic and mild to severe and causing death. Host factors including age, sex, and comorbid conditions are key determinants of disease severity and progression. Aging itself is a prominent risk factor for severe disease and death from COVID-19. We hypothesize that age-related decline and dysregulation of immune function, i.e., immunosenescence and inflammaging play a major role in contributing to heightened vulnerability to severe COVID-19 outcomes in older adults. Much remains to be learned about the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We need to begin partitioning all immunological outcome data by age to better understand disease heterogeneity and aging. Such knowledge is critical not only for understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis but also for COVID-19 vaccine development."
1434,A rational strategy to support approved COVID-19 vaccines prioritization.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a set of criteria to be considered for the prioritization of COVID-19 candidate vaccines for further development of phase II/III clinical trials, thinking in a target audience that includes vaccine scientists, product developers, manufacturers, regulators, and funding agencies. In this paper, a knowledge-based or rational strategy is employed to perform a prioritization matrix of approved COVID-19 vaccines: BBIBP-CorV, JANSSEN, CORONAVAC, SPUTNIK V, MODERNA, PFIZER, and VAXZEVRIA, based on those proposed criteria by WHO, related to safety, efficacy, stability, implementation, and availability. We found that JANSSEN vaccine is the one with the highest score in the present study, but our analysis suggests that the WHO criteria could be more useful if they are considered separately, taking into account the social, demographic and economic characteristics of each country."

1438,Non-infectious status indicated by detectable IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2.,"A key tenet of protection from infection for dentists is to know who is not infectious. The evidence base regarding protection from respiratory pathogens in dentistry is poor. Those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody are non-infectious (>99% certainty) and can be safely treated with good universal precautions, even for aerosol generating procedures. Viral infectivity with SARS-CoV-2 lasts eight days, unlike viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests which can persist for as long as seven weeks. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody becomes detectable from 11 days after infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are usually neutralising against the virus and their direct antiviral activity was partially demonstrated in 33,000 patients with COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma in the USA. So, a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is a much more accurate determination of infectiousness than a repeat PCR which is only 70% sensitive. It remains to be seen whether SARS-Cov-2 vaccine responses include protective IgG titres and, once vaccines become widespread, can be used to assist decision-making on appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in dentistry."
1439,What We Do Know and Do Not Yet Know about COVID-19 Vaccines as of the Beginning of the Year 2021.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which started at the end of 2019 and has spread worldwide, has remained unabated in 2021. Since non-pharmaceutical interventions including social distancing are facing limitations in controlling COVID-19, additional absolute means to change the trend are necessary. To this end, coronavirus-specific antiviral drugs and vaccines are urgently needed, but for now, the priority is to promote herd immunity through extensive nationwide vaccination campaign. In addition to the vaccines based on the conventional technology such inactivated or killed virus or protein subunit vaccines, several vaccines on the new technological platforms, for example, nucleic acids-based vaccines delivered by viral carriers, nanoparticles, or plasmids as a medium were introduced in this pandemic. In addition to achieving sufficient herd immunity with vaccination, the development of antiviral treatments that work specifically against COVID-19 will also be necessary to terminate the epidemic completely."
