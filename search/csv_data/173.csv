1721,Keratoplasty Rejection After the BNT162b2 messenger RNA Vaccine.,"Purpose: The aim of this report was to report 2 patients who presented with acute corneal graft rejection 2 weeks after receiving the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Methods: Case report. Results: Two men, aged 73 and 56 years, with a history of penetrating keratoplasty due to keratoconus were noted to have acute corneal graft rejection 2 weeks after receiving a first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Both patients were treated with hourly dexamethasone 0.1% and oral prednisone 60 mg per day with prompt resolution of keratoplasty rejection. Conclusions: The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine may be have been associated with a low-risk corneal graft rejection that responded well to topical and systemic steroids. Treating physicians should be aware of this potential complication and patients should be advised to report any visual changes after vaccination."

1723,Diffuse prothrombotic syndrome after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine administration: a case report.,"Background: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is emerging as one of the most relevant side effects of adenoviral-based vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019. Given the novelty of this disease, the medical community is seeking new evidence and clinical experiences on the management of these patients. Case presentation: In this article, we describe the case of a 73-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with diffuse prothrombotic syndrome, both in the arterial and venous districts, following the first dose administration of ChAdOx1 CoV-19 vaccine. The main thrombotic sites included the brain, with both a cortical ischemic lesion and thromboses of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses and the lower limbs, with deep venous thrombosis accompanied by subsegmental pulmonary thromboembolism. The deep venous thrombosis progressively evolved into acute limb ischemia, requiring surgical intervention with thromboendoarterectomy. Anticoagulation was maintained throughout the whole hospitalization period and continued in the outpatient setting using vitamin K antagonists for a recommended period of 6 months. Conclusions: This case describes the management of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia in a complicated clinical scenario, including multisite arterial and venous thromboses. Given the complexity of the patient presentation, this case may implement the comprehension of the mechanisms and clinical features of this disease; it also provides a picture of the challenges related to the management, often requiring a multidisciplinary approach."
1724,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines Based on the Spike Glycoprotein and Implications of New Viral Variants.,"Coronavirus 19 Disease (COVID-19) originating in the province of Wuhan, China in 2019, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whose infection in humans causes mild or severe clinical manifestations that mainly affect the respiratory system. So far, the COVID-19 has caused more than 2 million deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 contains the Spike (S) glycoprotein on its surface, which is the main target for current vaccine development because antibodies directed against this protein can neutralize the infection. Companies and academic institutions have developed vaccines based on the S glycoprotein, as well as its antigenic domains and epitopes, which have been proven effective in generating neutralizing antibodies. However, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants could affect the effectiveness of vaccines. Here, we review the different types of vaccines designed and developed against SARS-CoV-2, placing emphasis on whether they are based on the complete S glycoprotein, its antigenic domains such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or short epitopes within the S glycoprotein. We also review and discuss the possible effectiveness of these vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants."
1725,Vaccinomic approach for novel multi epitopes vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"Background: The spread of a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and other countries is of great concern worldwide with no effective vaccine. This study aimed to design a novel vaccine construct against SARS-CoV-2 from the spike S protein and orf1ab polyprotein using immunoinformatics tools. The vaccine was designed from conserved epitopes interacted against B and T lymphocytes by the combination of highly immunogenic epitopes with suitable adjuvant and linkers. Results: The proposed vaccine composed of 526 amino acids and was shown to be antigenic in Vaxigen server (0.6194) and nonallergenic in Allertop server. The physiochemical properties of the vaccine showed isoelectric point of 10.19. The instability index (II) was 31.25 classifying the vaccine as stable. Aliphatic index was 84.39 and the grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was - 0.049 classifying the vaccine as hydrophilic. Vaccine tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated to assess the stability of the vaccine via Ramachandran plot and ProSA-web servers. Moreover, solubility of the vaccine construct was greater than the average solubility provided by protein sol and SOLpro servers indicating the solubility of the vaccine construct. Disulfide engineering was performed to reduce the high mobile regions in the vaccine to enhance stability. Docking of the vaccine construct with TLR4 demonstrated efficient binding energy with attractive binding energy of - 338.68 kcal/mol and - 346.89 kcal/mol for TLR4 chain A and chain B respectively. Immune simulation significantly provided high levels of immunoglobulins, T-helper cells, T-cytotoxic cells and INF-Î³. Upon cloning, the vaccine protein was reverse transcribed into DNA sequence and cloned into pET28a(+) vector to ensure translational potency and microbial expression. Conclusion: A unique vaccine construct from spike S protein and orf1ab polyprotein against B and T lymphocytes was generated with potential protection against the pandemic. The present study might assist in developing a suitable therapeutics protocol to combat SARSCoV-2 infection."

1727,2D materials as a diagnostic platform for the detection and sensing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: a bird's-eye view.,"Worldwide infections and fatalities caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants responsible for COVID-19 have significantly impeded the economic growth of many nations. People in many nations have lost their livelihoods, it has severely impacted international relations and, most importantly, health infrastructures across the world have been tormented. This pandemic has already left footprints on human psychology, traits, and priorities and is certainly going to lead towards a new world order in the future. As always, science and technology have come to the rescue of the human race. The prevention of infection by instant and repeated cleaning of surfaces that are most likely to be touched in daily life and sanitization drives using medically prescribed sanitizers and UV irradiation of textiles are the first steps to breaking the chain of transmission. However, the real challenge is to develop and uplift medical infrastructure, such as diagnostic tools capable of prompt diagnosis and instant and economic medical treatment that is available to the masses. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, are atomic sheets that have been in the news for quite some time due to their unprecedented electronic mobilities, high thermal conductivity, appreciable thermal stability, excellent anchoring capabilities, optical transparency, mechanical flexibility, and a unique capability to integrate with arbitrary surfaces. These attributes of 2D materials make them lucrative for use as an active material platform for authentic and prompt (within minutes) disease diagnosis via electrical or optical diagnostic tools or via electrochemical diagnosis. We present the opportunities provided by 2D materials as a platform for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis."
1728,In-house reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for detection of SARS-CoV-2 with increased sensitivity.,"As the COVID-19 infection continues to ravage the world, the advent of an efficient as well as the economization of the existing RT-PCR based detection assay essentially can become a blessing in these testing times and significantly help in the management of the pandemic. This study demonstrated an innovative and rapid corroboration of COVID-19 test based on innovative multiplex PCR. An assessment of optimal PCR conditions to simultaneously amplify the SARS-CoV-2 genes E, S and RdRp has been made by fast-conventional and HRM coupled multiplex real-time PCR using the same sets of primers. All variables of practical value were studied by amplifying known target-sequences from ten-fold dilutions of archived positive samples of COVID-19 disease. The multiplexing with newly designed E, S and RdRp primers have shown an efficient amplification of the target region of SARS-CoV-2. A distinct amplification was observed in 37 min using thermal cycler while it took 96 min in HRM coupled real time detection using SYBR green over a wide range of template concentrations. Our findings revealed decent concordance with other commercially available detection kits. This fast HRM coupled multiplex real-time PCR with SYBR green approach offers rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a cost-effective manner apart from the added advantage of primer compatibility for use in conventional multiplex PCR. The highly reproducible novel approach can propel extended applicability for developing sustainable commercial product besides providing relief to a resource limited setting."
