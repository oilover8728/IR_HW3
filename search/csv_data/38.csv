370,Increased SARS-CoV-2 Testing Capacity with Pooled Saliva Samples.,"We analyzed feasibility of pooling saliva samples for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing and found that sensitivity decreased according to pool size: 5 samples/pool, 7.4% reduction; 10 samples/pool, 11.1%; and 20 samples/pool, 14.8%. When virus prevalence is >2.6%, pools of 5 require fewer tests; when <0.6%, pools of 20 support screening strategies."
371,"""David vs. Goliath"": A simple antigen detection test with potential to change diagnostic strategy for SARS-CoV-2.","Introduction: As regard to all pandemics, the current COVID-19 pandemic, could also have been better managed with prudent use of preventive measures coupled with rapid diagnostic tools such as rapid antigen tests, but their efficacy is under question because of projected lower sensitivity as compared to Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, which although considered gold standard has its own limitations. Methodology: A prospective, single centre study was carried out to evaluate the performance of Standard Q COVID-19 Ag, a rapid immuno-chromatographic assay for antigen detection, against TrueNat, a chip-based, point-of-care, portable, Real-Time PCR analyzer for diagnosis of COVID-19; on 467 nasal swab samples from suspected subjects at a fever clinic in North India in month of July 2020. Results: Of the 467 specimens tested, TrueNat showed positive result in 29 (6.2%), majority of whom were asymptomatic (72.4%) while 4/29 (13.9%) had influenza like illness and 2/29 (6.8%) presented with severe acute respiratory illness. Compared to TrueNat, Rapid antigen test gave concordance for 26 samples, while for 2 samples the result was false positive; giving an overall sensitivity of 89.7% (95% CI = 72.6- 97.8) and a specificity of 99.5%, indicating strong agreement between two methods. Conclusion: Community prevalence plays an important role is choosing the laboratory test and result interpretation. Rapid antigen detection tests definitely have a big role to play, especially in resource limited setting, for early diagnosis as well as for source control to halt the spread."
372,"Diagnostic performance of a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test in a large, Norwegian cohort.","Background: Rapid antigen tests (RATs) may be included in national strategies for handling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as they provide test results rapidly, are easily performed outside laboratories, and enable immediate contract tracing. However, before implementation further clinical evaluation of test sensitivity is warranted. Objectives: To examine the performance of Abbott's Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a low to medium prevalence setting in Norway. Study design: A prospective study comparing the results of the Panbio RAT with PCR in 4857 parallel samples collected at a SARS-CoV-2 test station in Oslo, and from COVID-19 outbreaks in six Norwegian municipalities. Results: A total of 4857 cases were included in the study; 3991 and 866 cases from the test station and the outbreak municipalities, respectively. The prevalence at the test station in Oslo was 6.3 %, and the overall sensitivity of the RAT was 74 %. Increased sensitivity was observed in patients who experienced symptoms (79 %) and when considering samples with viral loads above estimated level of infectivity (84 %), while it was lower in asymptomatic persons (55 %). In the outbreak municipalities, the overall prevalence was 6.9 %, and the total sensitivity of the RAT was 70 %. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the test correctly identified most infectious individuals. Nevertheless, the sensitivity is considerably lower than for PCR, and it is important that the limitations of the test are kept in mind in the follow-up of tested individuals."
373,Overcoming spectrum bias for accurate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates.,
374,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children: a prospective multicentre cohort study.,"Background: Studies based on molecular testing of oral/nasal swabs underestimate SARS-CoV-2 infection due to issues with test sensitivity, test timing and selection bias. The objective of this study was to report the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, consistent with previous infection. Design: This multicentre observational cohort study, conducted between 16 April to 3 July 2020 at 5 UK sites, recruited children of healthcare workers, aged 2-15 years. Participants provided blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and data were gathered regarding unwell contacts and symptoms. Results: 1007 participants were enrolled, and 992 were included in the final analysis. The median age of participants was 10·1 years. There were 68 (6.9%) participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests indicative of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 34/68 (50%) reported no symptoms prior to testing. The presence of antibodies and the mean antibody titre was not influenced by age. Following multivariable analysis four independent variables were identified as significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity: known infected household contact OR=10.9 (95% CI 6.1 to 19.6); fatigue OR=16.8 (95% CI 5.5 to 51.9); gastrointestinal symptoms OR=6.6 (95% CI 3.0 to 13.8); and changes in sense of smell or taste OR=10.0 (95% CI 2.4 to 11.4). Discussion: Children demonstrated similar antibody titres in response to SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of age. Fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in sense of smell or taste were the symptoms most strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity. Trial registration number: NCT0434740."
375,Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 by pulse-controlled amplification (PCA).,"In the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, rapid identification of infected individuals is crucial for management and control of the outbreak. However, transport of samples, sample processing and RT-qPCR analysis in laboratories are time-consuming. Here we present a prototype of a novel nucleic acid-based test format - pulse controlled amplification - that allows detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from up to eight swab samples simultaneously without the need for RNA extraction within 25 min with a sensitivity of 100 % for samples with a viral load of ≥ 1.6 × 10e3 copies/μl This new principle might pave the way to rapid and sensitive point of care testing."
376,Analytic Sensitivity of 3 Nucleic Acid Detection Assays in Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Background: Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcription PCR is the primary method to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the analytic sensitivity required is not well defined and it is unclear how available assays compare. Methods: For the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (m2000; Abbott Molecular), we determined that it could detect viral concentrations as low as 26 copies/mL, we defined the relationship between cycle number and viral concentrations, and we tested naso- and oropharyngeal swab specimens from 8538 consecutive individuals. Using the m2000 as a reference assay method, we described the distribution of viral concentrations in these patients. We then used selected clinical specimens to determine the positive percent agreement of 2 other assays with more rapid turnaround times [Cepheid Xpert Xpress (GeneXpert; Cepheid); n = 27] and a laboratory developed test on the Luminex ARIES system [ARIES LDT (Luminex); n = 50] as a function of virus concentrations, from which we projected their false-negative rates in our patient population. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 27% (95% CI: 26%-28%) of all specimens. Estimated viral concentrations were widely distributed, and 17% (95% CI: 16%-19%) of positive individuals had viral concentrations <845 copies/mL. Positive percent agreement was strongly related to viral concentration, and reliable detection (i.e., ≥95%) was observed at concentrations >100 copies/mL for the GeneXpert but not the ARIES LDT, corresponding to projected false-negative rates of 4% (95% CI: 0%-21%) and 27% (95% CI: 11%-46%), respectively. Conclusions: Substantial proportions of clinical specimens have low to moderate viral concentrations and may be missed by methods with less analytic sensitivity."
377,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is not detected in the vagina: A prospective study.,Objective: To determine whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is present in the vagina of women diagnosed with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Study design: The study was conducted prospectively in a university affiliated hospital. Forty-one women of reproductive age whose nasopharyngeal PCR test were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and clinically diagnosed with pneumonia were included in the study. Vaginal swabs were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests when the patients were admitted to the inpatient service before pneumonia treatment was initiated. Results: Vaginal swab samples of 38 patients were analysed with SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. None of the vaginal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 does not infect the vagina of women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
378,Development of robust isothermal RNA amplification assay for lab-free testing of RNA viruses.,"Simple tests of infectiousness that return results in minutes and directly from samples even with low viral loads could be a potential game-changer in the fight against COVID-19. Here, we describe an improved isothermal nucleic acid amplification assay, termed the RICCA (RNA Isothermal Co-assisted and Coupled Amplification) reaction, that consists of a simple one-pot format of 'sample-in and result-out' with a primary focus on the detection of low copy numbers of RNA virus directly from saliva without the need for laboratory processing. We demonstrate our assay by detecting 16S rRNA directly from E. coli cells with a sensitivity as low as 8 CFU/μL and RNA fragments from a synthetic template of SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity as low as 1740 copies/μL. We further demonstrate the applicability of our assay for real-time testing at the point of care by designing a closed format for paper-based lateral flow assay and detecting heat-inactivated SARS-COV-2 virus in human saliva at concentrations ranging from 28,000 to 2.8 copies/μL with a total assay time of 15-30 min."
379,Over 90% of clinical swabs used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics contain sufficient nucleic acid concentrations.,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), reliable diagnostics are absolutely indispensable. Molecular SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics based on nucleic acids (NA) derived from oro- or nasopharyngeal swabs constitute the current gold standard. Given the importance of test results, it is crucial to assess the quality of the underlying swab samples and NA extraction procedures. We determined NA concentrations in clinical samples used for SARS-CoV-2 testing applying an NA-specific dye. In comparison to cut-offs defined by SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, internal positive controls, and references from a federal laboratory, 90.85% (923 of 1016) of swabs contained NA concentrations enabling SARS-CoV-2 recognition. Swabs collected by local health authorities and the central emergency department either had significantly higher NA concentrations or were less likely to exhibit insufficient quality, arguing in favor of sampling centers with routined personnel. Interestingly, samples taken from females had significantly higher NA concentrations than those from males. Among eight longitudinal patient sample sets with intermitting negative quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results, two showed reduced NA concentrations in negative specimens. The herein described fluorescence-based NA quantification approach is immediately applicable to evaluate swab qualities, optimize sampling strategies, identify patient-specific differences, and explain some peculiar test results including intermittent negative samples with low NA concentrations."
