9131,Un cas de COVID-19 complique dembolie avec deux tests PCR initialement negatifs malgre des signes scanographiques.,La maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) déclarée en Chine en fin 2019 s´est rapidement généralisée aux autres continents. Son diagnostic se fait par test PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) sur des prélèvements naso-pharyngés. Ce test bien que spécifique est d´une sensibilité moindre comparé à la TDM thoracique. Nous rapportons le cas d´un patient testé négatif à deux reprises et chez qui la TDM retrouvait des signes typiques de COVID-19 et une embolie pulmonaire. Et ce n´est qu´après un troisième test PCR qu´il a été positif. Ce qui montre l´intérêt de répéter plusieurs fois les tests PCR mais également de considérer les signes scanographiques comme argument diagnostic devant induire une prise en charge adéquate.
9132,The Experience of Greece as a Model to Contain COVID-19 Infection Spread.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and has caused a pandemic known as corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), responsible for the death of more than 2 million people worldwide. The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented threat on human lives and public safety. The aim of this review is to describe key aspects of the bio-pathology of the novel disease, and discuss aspects of its spread, as well as targeted protective strategies that can help shape the outcome of the present and future health crises. Greece is used as a model to inhibit SARS-COV-2 spread, since it is one of the countries with the lowest fatality rates among nations of the European Union (E.U.), following two consecutive waves of COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, niche research technological approaches and scientific recommendations that emerged during the COVID-19 era are discussed."
9133,The neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19: Interactions with psychiatric illness and pharmacological treatment.,"The recent outbreak of the corona virus disease (COVID-19) has had major global impact. The relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and psychiatric diseases is of great concern, with an evident link between corona virus infections and various central and peripheral nervous system manifestations. Unmitigated neuro-inflammation has been noted to underlie not only the severe respiratory complications of the disease but is also present in a range of neuro-psychiatric illnesses. Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by immune-inflammatory states, while treatments for these disorders have distinct anti-inflammatory properties and effects. With inflammation being a common contributing factor in SARS-CoV-2, as well as psychiatric disorders, treatment of either condition may affect disease progression of the other or alter response to pharmacological treatment. In this review, we elucidate how viral infections could affect pre-existing psychiatric conditions and how pharmacological treatments of these conditions may affect overall progress and outcome in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. We address whether any treatment-induced benefits and potential adverse effects may ultimately affect the overall treatment approach, considering the underlying dysregulated neuro-inflammatory processes and potential drug interactions. Finally, we suggest adjunctive treatment options for SARS-CoV-2-associated neuro-psychiatric symptoms."
9134,Interactions between SARS coronavirus 2 papain-like protease and immune system: A potential drug target for the treatment of COVID-19.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of respiratory viruses which can cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections. Recently, new coronavirus named as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified which is a major threat to public health. Innate immune responses play a vital role in a host's defence against viruses. Interestingly, CoVs have evolved elaborate strategies to evade the complex system of sensors and signalling molecules to suppress host immunity. SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro), as an important coronavirus enzyme, regulates viral spread and innate immune responses. SCoV-2 PLpro is multifunctional enzyme with deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating activity. The PLpro can interact with key regulators in signalling pathways such as STING, NF-κB, cytokine production, MAPK and TGF-β and hijack those to block the immune responses. Therefore, the PLpro can be as an important target for the treatment of COVID-19. Until now, several drugs or compounds have been identified that can inhibit PLpro activity. Here we discuss about the dysregulation effects of PLpro on immune system and drugs that have potential inhibitors for SCoV-2 PLpro."
9135,Transmission Modes of COVID-19: A Systematic Review.,"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious viral infection that was initiated in Wuhan, China, and has spread around the world. The high prevalence and rapid transmission between individuals of COVID-19 have become an international challenge that requires careful consideration. We aimed to review the current evidence of COVID-19 transmission modes. Methods: This study was a systematic review performed to identify current evidence of COVID-19 transmission modes. We searched selected keywords in six key databases to discover sources relevant to the main objective of the study. To identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria, the authors screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved documents. The appropriate articles were then selected and their results were discussed to make the final inclusion. Results: We identified five potential transmission modes of COVID-19, including airborne, droplet, contact with contaminated surfaces, oral and fecal secretions. Furthermore, some studies have pointed out other modes of virus transmission, such as person to person, and direct contact with animals. Conclusion: Droplet and contact with contaminated surfaces are the most frequent transmission modes of COVID-19. However, fecal excretion, environmental contamination, and fluid pollution may also contribute to viral transmission. The possibility of fecal transmission in COVID-19 has implications, especially in areas that are poorly hygienic. Environmental pollution can be caused by patients with SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and feces. Consequently, the human environment will become a potential medium of virus transmission."

9137,Asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in a Rehabilitation Facility: Evolution of the Presence of Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 and Serological Antibody Responses.,"At the start of the UK coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, this rare point prevalence study revealed that one-third of patients (15 of 45) in a London inpatient rehabilitation unit were found to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but asymptomatic. We report on 8 patients in detail, including their clinical stability, the evolution of their nasopharyngeal viral reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) burden, and their antibody levels over time, revealing the infection dynamics by RT-PCR and serology during the acute phase. Notably, a novel serological test for antibodies against the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 showed that 100% of our asymptomatic cohort remained seropositive 3-6 weeks after diagnosis."

9139,Genomic variation and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 importation and early circulation in Israel.,"Severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes corona virus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since led to a global pandemic. Importations of SARS-CoV-2 to Israel in late February from multiple countries initiated a rapid outbreak across the country. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes were sequenced from 59 imported samples with a recorded country of importation and 101 early circulating samples in February to mid-March 2020 and analyzed to infer clades and mutational patterns with additional sequences identified Israel available in public databases. Recorded importations in February to mid-March, mostly from Europe, led to multiple transmissions in all districts in Israel. Although all SARS-CoV-2 defined clades were imported, clade 20C became the dominating clade in the circulating samples. Identification of novel, frequently altered mutated positions correlating with clade-defining positions provide data for surveillance of this evolving pandemic and spread of specific clades of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and mutate in Israel and across the globe. With economy and travel resuming, surveillance of clades and accumulating mutations is crucial for understanding its evolution and spread patterns and may aid in decision making concerning public health issues."
