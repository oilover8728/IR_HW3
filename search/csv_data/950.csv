9491,Long-term monitoring of the development and extinction of IgA and IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Despite the great interest of the scientific community in the behavior of the human body after contact with the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), long-term (more than 6 months) monitoring of the immunological status of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) having varying severity degrees and of the people with a low SARS-CoV-2 viral load is practically absent. The aim of this study is a 9-month monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection immune response development and extinction using quantitative assessment of IgA and IgG levels in the blood of healthy donors living in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and of the patients who have undergone COVID-19. The project involved 180 volunteers, of whom 51 persons (28.33%) fell ill with COVID-19 during the observation period. All people who underwent COVID-19 developed a stable humoral immune response but their individual immune status had a number of features. Approximately 39.22% (20 of 51 people) of project participants diagnosed with COVID-19 showed an unusual change in plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA levels. Relatively high levels of IgA (ratio ~ 3) after recovery persisted for a long time (more than 6 months). In one-third (17 of 51 people) of patients with COVID-19, the IgA level exceeded the IgG level. IgA antibodies appeared earlier and showed a stronger and more robust response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than IgG. Increased levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA (ratio from 0.8 to 2.36) throughout the observation period were recorded in 28 of 180 project participants (15.56%) of whom only one person fell ill with COVID-19."

9493,The Debate: What Are Aerosol-Generating Procedures in Dentistry? A Rapid Review.,"Introduction: This article aims to review the current national and international dental guidance produced during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic to identify the level of consensus on aerosol-generating dental procedures (AGDPs). The outcomes intend to encourage increased collaboration with respect to dental guidelines in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as well as to improve decision making and safety for dental patients and staff. Methods: This rapid review was conducted by 2 authors (MKV and KD), with the support of a third author (SD), to assess current guidelines related to dental AGDPs. This streamlined review approach allowed synthesis of data in an efficient manner in the rapidly evolving environment associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Results: The findings identified 1) a lack of consistency in reporting which procedures were deemed an AGDP; 2) that high-speed handpieces, air-water syringes, and mechanical scalers were consistently considered high-risk AGDPs; 3) a lack of consensus on the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission with the use of slow-speed handpieces; 4) a general agreement, when described, that rubber dam and high-volume evacuation can significantly reduce aerosol production; and 5) a lack of consistency in reporting whether procedures constitute a low, moderate, or high risk of COVID-19 transmission. The findings are discussed in relation to the guidance and future recommendations. Conclusion: It is recommended that future published guidance should indicate the risk stratification (low/moderate/high) of each procedure/exposure in a standardized international approach. Knowledge transfer statement: The results of this rapid review can be used by clinicians to increase their awareness of international guidance on aerosol-generating procedures in dentistry. It will also encourage those publishing future guidance to provide an internationally standardized, risk-stratified approach to describing aerosol-generating procedures. Currently, it allows clinicians to consider aerosol-generating procedures as a risk spectrum."
9494,Longitudinal Dynamics of the Neutralizing Antibody Response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral agents for therapy. Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Blood samples (n = 173) were collected from 30 patients with COVID-19 over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines. Results: SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 days after symptom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 days (interquartile range [IQR], 24-59 days) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR, 19.6-42.4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0.41, P < .05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including stem cell factor (SCF), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Conclusions: These data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in patients with COVID-19 during the acute and convalescent phases."
9495,Fragmented QRS on surface electrocardiography as a predictor of cardiac mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Aims: Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is mainly a respiratory system disease, recent studies reported that cardiac injury is associated with poor outcomes in this population. There are few studies which assessed standard electrocardiogram (ECG) as a prognostic tool during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to identify the relationship between of ECG parameters and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Method and results: A total of 114 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and May 2020 were included in the study. Standard 12â€‘lead surface ECG was reviewed for presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS), abnormal Q wave, T wave inversion, and duration of QRS. fQRS was observed in 36.8% (n = 42) of the patients who had SARS-CoV-2. Patient groups with and without fQRS did not differ in terms of age, gender, the presence of comorbid diseases and medical treatment. Hospitalization duration, intensive care unit(ICU) requirement, all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality were found to be higher in patients with fQRS (all p values <0.05). There was a positive correlation between QRS duration and duration of hospital stay (p < 0.001, r = 0.421). QRS duration was also found to be associated with intensive care need, all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality. Conclusion: Our data shows that QRS duration and the presence of fQRS on standard ECG can help to identify patients with worse clinical outcome admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection."
9496,Myocarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.,"Background: Clinical trials of the BNT162b2 vaccine, revealed efficacy and safety. We report six cases of myocarditis, which occurred shortly after BNT162b2 vaccination. Methods: Patients were identified upon presentation to the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain/discomfort. In all study patients, we excluded past and current COVID-19. Routine clinical and laboratory investigations for common etiologies of myocarditis were performed. Laboratory tests also included troponin and C-reactive protein levels. The diagnosis of myocarditis was established after cardiac MRI. Findings: Five patients presented after the second and one after the first dose of the vaccine. All patients were males with a median age of 23 years. Myocarditis was diagnosed in all patients, there was no evidence of COVID-19 infection. Laboratory assays excluded concomitant infection; autoimmune disorder was considered unlikely. All patients responded to the BNT162b2 vaccine. The clinical course was mild in all six patients. Interpretation: Our report of myocarditis after BNT162b2 vaccination may be possibly considered as an adverse reaction following immunization. We believe our information should be interpreted with caution and further surveillance is warranted."
9497,A multiscale coarse-grained model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer simulations of complete viral particles can provide theoretical insights into large-scale viral processes including assembly, budding, egress, entry, and fusion. Detailed atomistic simulations are constrained to shorter timescales and require billion-atom simulations for these processes. Here, we report the current status and ongoing development of a largely ""bottom-up"" coarse-grained (CG) model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Data from a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), x-ray crystallography, and computational predictions were used to build molecular models of structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which were then assembled into a complete virion model. We describe how CG molecular interactions can be derived from all-atom simulations, how viral behavior difficult to capture in atomistic simulations can be incorporated into the CG models, and how the CG models can be iteratively improved as new data become publicly available. Our initial CG model and the detailed methods presented are intended to serve as a resource for researchers working on COVID-19 who are interested in performing multiscale simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion."
9498,"Etiology and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses among children in Zhejiang Province, China 2017-2019.","Background: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerging has put global public health institutes on high alert. Little is known about the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of human coronaviruses infections in relation to infections with other respiratory viruses. Methods: From February 2017 to December 2019, 3660 respiratory samples submitted to Zhejiang Children Hospital with acute respiratory symptoms were tested for four human coronaviruses RNA by a novel two-tube multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Samples were also screened for the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Results: Coronavirus RNAs were detected in 144 (3.93%) specimens: HCoV-HKU1 in 38 specimens, HCoV-NL63 in 62 specimens, HCoV-OC43 in 38 specimens and HCoV-229E in 8 specimens. Genomes for SARS-CoV-2 were absent in all specimens by RT-PCR analysis during the study period. The majority of HCoV infections occurred during fall months. No significant differences in gender, sample type, year were seen across species. 37.5 to 52.6% of coronaviruses detected were in specimens testing positive for other respiratory viruses. Phylogenic analysis identified that Zhejiang coronaviruses belong to multiple lineages of the coronaviruses circulating in other countries and areas. Conclusion: Common HCoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in fall months in the Zhejiang province, China. Genetic relatedness to the coronaviruses in other regions suggests further surveillance on human coronaviruses in clinical samples are clearly needed to understand their patterns of activity and role in the emergence of novel coronaviruses."
9499,"Brief Report: COVID-19 Testing, Characteristics, and Outcomes Among People Living With HIV in an Integrated Health System.","Background: Understanding the attributes of COVID-19 clinical severity among people living with HIV (PLWH) compared with those in HIV-uninfected patients is critical for risk stratification and treatment strategies. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California among PLWH aged 18 years or older. We compared the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing, COVID-19 diagnosis, and COVID-19 hospitalization among PLWH and HIV-uninfected adults. A chart review was conducted for PLWH with COVID-19 to examine viral suppression of HIV and most recent CD4+ counts in the year before COVID-19 diagnosis, known exposures to COVID-19, and clinical presentation. Results: Between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing, COVID-19 diagnosis, and COVID-19 hospitalization was 551.2, 57.0, and 9.3 per 10,000 PLWH, respectively, compared with 268.4, 34.6, and 5.3 per 10,000 HIV-uninfected individuals, respectively. Among those with COVID-19, the distribution of race/ethnicity, smoking status, and comorbidities was similar in PLWH and HIV-uninfected patients; however, PLWH were mostly men, younger, and less obese than HIV-uninfected individuals. Health care utilization regarding emergency care and hospitalizations in the year before COVID-19-related hospitalization was similar between the groups. Overall, HIV was virologically suppressed in >95% of PLWH with COVID-19, and HIV viral load and CD4+ status did not differ between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. Conclusions: In this population of patients with well-controlled HIV infection, the incidence of testing, diagnosis, and hospitalization for COVID-19 was higher in PLWH than that in HIV-uninfected patients."
