5520,Chest CT Imaging Features of Typical Covert COVID-19 Cases.,"Purpose: To analyze the chest CT imaging findings of patients with initial negative RT-PCR and to compare with the CT findings of the same sets of patients when the RT-PCR turned positive for SARS-CoV-2 a few days later. Materials and methods: A total of 32 patients (8 males and 24 females; 52.9±7years old) with COVID-19 from 27 January and 26 February 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinical and radiological characteristics were analyzed. Results: The median period (25%, 75%) between initial symptoms and the first chest CT, the initial negative RT-PCR, the second CT and the positive RT-PCR were 7(4.25,11.75), 7(5,10.75), 15(11,23) and 14(10,22) days, respectively. Ground glass opacities was the most frequent CT findings at both the first and second CTs. Consolidation was more frequently observed on lower lobes, and more frequently detected during the second CT (64.0%) with positive RT-PCR than the first CT with initial negative RT-PCR (53.1%). The median of total lung severity score and the number of lobes affected had significant difference between twice chest CT (P=0.007 and P=0.011, respectively). Conclusion: In the first week of disease course, CT was sensitive to the COVID-19 with initial negative RT-PCR. Throat swab test turned positive while chest CT mostly demonstrated progression."

5522,"[Epidemiology, Treatment, and Epidemic Prevention and Control of the Coronavirus Disease 2019: a Review].","This review summarizes the ongoing researches regarding etiology, epidemiology, transmission dynamics, treatment, and prevention and control strategies of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with comparison to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and pandemic H1N1 virus. SARS-CoV-2 may be originated from bats, and the patients and asymptomatic carriers are the source of epidemic infection. The virus can be transmitted human-to-human through droplets and close contact, and people at all ages are susceptible to this virus. The main clinical symptoms of the patients are fever and cough, accompanied with leukocytopenia and lymphocytopenia. Effective drugs have been not yet available thus far. In terms of the prevention and control strategies, vaccine development as the primary prevention should be accelerated. Regarding the secondary prevention, ongoing efforts of the infected patients and close contacts quarantine, mask wearing promotion, regular disinfection in public places should be continued. Meanwhile, rapid detection kit for serological monitoring of the virus in general population is expected so as to achieve early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment. In addition, public health education on this disease and prevention should be enhanced so as to mitigate panic and mobilize the public to jointly combat the epidemic."
5523,"COVID-19 treatment: Much research and testing, but far, few magic bullets against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.","The new virus of the of β-Coronaviruses genus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and is winning a proverbial chess match against all players simultaneous, including physicians, clinicians, pathologists, doctors, scientists, economists, athletes and politicians. The COVID-19 outbreak has seriously threatened public health, killing the most vulnerable persons and causing general panic. To stop this disease, effective remedies (i.e., drugs, vaccines, personal protection elements, etc.) are urgently required. Unfortunately, no registered specific therapies (including antiviral therapies, immune-modulating agents and vaccines) are currently available to treat coronavirus infections, highlighting an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. In this work, fourteen existing small molecule drugs or/and experimental drugs selected by experts and examined from the point of view of bioavailability via the Lipinski-Veber rules and assessment of their physicochemical descriptors. The aim of this study is to discover selected pattern similarities and peculiar characteristics that could be useful for antiviral drug optimization, drug combination or new antiviral agent design."
5524,Humoral response to COVID-19 infection in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"The course of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) might be determined by certain comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases) and advanced age. Because the impact of immunosuppression on disease severity is not entirely clear, management of patients under immunosuppressive treatment remains controversial. Six cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with COVID-19 on immunosuppressive medication are presented. The aim of this study was to describe patients' clinical manifestation and chronologic development of virus-specific antibodies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection before and after restart with immunosuppressive/biological therapy as an indicator for a specific immune response. All patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-RNA with PCR, were in clinical remission prior to COVID-19 and only one patient continued his immunosuppressive treatment during the COVID-19 infection. Initial symptoms of COVID-19 were pyrexia, diarrhea, cephalea, and dysgeusia and anosmia. No patient needed admission to hospital or ICU. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody development was described to be late in three of the six patients. Late antibody development seems to be more frequent in older patients and in patients with combined immunosuppressive treatment. In this scenario, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing could be useful prior to restarting immunosuppressive therapy."
5525,"Characteristics of COVID-19 Cases and Outbreaks at Child Care Facilities - District of Columbia, July-December 2020.","The occurrence of cases of COVID-19 reported by child care facilities among children, teachers, and staff members is correlated with the level of community spread (1,2). To describe characteristics of COVID-19 cases at child care facilities and facility adherence to guidance and recommendations, the District of Columbia (DC) Department of Health (DC Health) and CDC reviewed COVID-19 case reports associated with child care facilities submitted to DC Health and publicly available data from the DC Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) during July 1-December 31, 2020. Among 469 licensed child care facilities, 112 (23.9%) submitted 269 reports documenting 316 laboratory-confirmed cases and three additional cases identified through DC Health's contact tracers. Outbreaks associated with child care facilities,† defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed and epidemiologically linked cases at a facility within a 14-day period (3), occurred in 27 (5.8%) facilities and accounted for nearly one half (156; 48.9%) of total cases. Among the 319 total cases, 180 (56.4%) were among teachers or staff members. The majority (56.4%) of facilities reported cases to DC Health on the same day that they were notified of a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by staff members or parents.§ Facilities were at increased risk for an outbreak if they had been operating for <3 years, if symptomatic persons sought testing ≥3 days after symptom onset, or if persons with asymptomatic COVID-19 were at the facility. The number of outbreaks associated with child care facilities was limited. Continued implementation and maintenance of multiple prevention strategies, including vaccination, masking, physical distancing, cohorting, screening, and reporting, are important to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in child care facilities and to facilitate a timely public health response to prevent outbreaks.¶."
5526,Induction of Potent and Durable Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Using a Receptor Binding Domain-Based Immunogen.,"A novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe pneumonia emerged through zoonosis in late 2019. The disease, referred to as COVID-19, has an alarming mortality rate and it is having a devastating effect on the global economy and public health systems. A safe, effective vaccine is urgently needed to halt this pandemic. In this study, immunogenicity of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) glycoprotein was examined in mice. Animals were immunized with recombinant RBD antigen intraperitoneally using three different adjuvants (Zn-chitosan, Alhydrogel, and Adju-Phos), and antibody responses were followed for over 5 months. Results showed that potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) can be induced with 70% neutralization titer (NT70) of ~14,580 against live, infectious viruses. Although antigen-binding antibody titers decreased gradually over time, sufficiently protective levels of nAbs persisted (NT80 >2,430) over the 5-month observation period. Results also showed that adjuvants have profound effects on kinetics of nAb induction, total antibody titers, antibody avidity, antibody longevity, and B-cell epitopes targeted by the immune system. In conclusion, a recombinant subunit protein immunogen based on the RBD is a highly promising vaccine candidate. Continued evaluation of RBD immunogenicity using different adjuvants and vaccine regimens could further improve vaccine efficacy."

5529,COVID-19 in Neonates: A Call for Standardized Testing.,"The limited evidence on neonatal coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests that vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rare, and most neonates seem to acquire the infection postnatally through respiratory droplets and contact. Testing of neonates with perinatal or postnatal exposure to COVID-19 infection plays a vital role in the early diagnosis, management and institution of infection prevention measures thereby cutting off the chain of epidemic transmission. A recently concluded online neonatal COVID-19 conference conducted by the National Neonatology Forum (NNF) of India and a nationwide online survey pointed to substantial variation in neonatal testing strategies. We, herein, summarize the relevant literature about the incidence and outcomes of neonatal COVID-19 and call for a universal and uniform testing strategy for exposed neonates. We anticipate that the testing strategy put forth in this article will facilitate better management and safe infection prevention measures among all units offering neonatal care in the country."
