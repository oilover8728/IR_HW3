7470,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in clinical specimens and clinical characteristics of 10 patients with COVID-19 in Macau.,"As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the ""Severe"" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the ""Mild to Moderate"" group (p<0.001). There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified."
7471,COVID-19: A new challenge for mental health and policymaking recommendations.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has emerged lately, leading to a serious public health threat. The clinical features associated with COVID-19 are yet to be conclusively documented. Caution is needed when interpreting the severity of the symptoms as most of the diagnosed patients are those attending clinical assessments. Features of COVID-19 are far from understood. There is a suggested increased risk of COVID-19 infection among people with mental health disorders, which is primarily attributable to the challenges associated with limited resources. There are a variety of reasons why individuals with mental health disorders are more susceptible to infectious diseases. There is currently no specific recommended antiviral treatment. The interventions now used are supportive treatments to alleviate the symptoms and invasive mechanical ventilation. In this review, we discuss the adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccinations. We further highlight the need to develop guidelines and recommendations for managing patients with mental health. It is evident from this review, there is a need to provide training programs with interprofessional, multidisciplinary communication channels."

7473,[Safe surgery and COVID-19: A narrative review].,"Background: The interruption of surgical care in Spain caused by the pandemic must end. Recovery from this activity must be carried out on an elective basis and in conjunction with possible cases of COVID-19. The objective of this review was to incorporate good practice criteria related to COVID-19 into the context of safe surgery, which would make it possible to develop a proposed surgical safety checklist adapted to patients with this disease. Methods: Narrative literature review, following the PRISMA protocol, in the Medline and Cochrane directories, using the MeSH terms (coronavirus, infections, safety, surgical procedures, operative, checklist) and the Boolean operator AND. In addition, recommendations from scientific bodies and societies were reviewed (grey literature). Results: Thirty-three final studies were included with recommendations for safe surgery and surgical safety checklist adapted for COVID-19, the most frequent being aspects related to treatment (41.3%) and prevention and control measures (27.6%). Conclusions: The existence of a broad consensus on good practices recommended for COVID surgical patients makes it possible to make a proposal for surgical safety checklist to these patients."
7474,What did we learn from the previous coronavirus epidemics and what can we do better: a neuroinfectiological point of view.,"We are learning gradually about the neurologic manifestations during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)‐19 pandemic, a respiratory disease related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). As the clinical evidence is still limited, it makes a sense to critically analyze the spectrum of neurologic involvement caused by SARS‐CoV‐1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV), which were causal for epidemics in 2003 and 2012, respectively."
7475,"COVID-19 in children, adolescents and young adults: a cross-sectional study in Espirito Santo, Brazil, 2020.","Objective: To analyze self-reported sociodemographic and clinical characteristics among individuals aged 2 to 22 years and possible associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Espírito Santo, Brazil. Methods: This was a serial cross-sectional population-based study carried out from May to June 2020. The COVID-19 positivity rate was assessed by serological testing, and associated factors were assessed using Pearson's chi-square test (5% significance level). Results: Among 1,693 individuals aged 2 to 22 years, 6.1% tested positive for COVID-19 and, among these, 35.5% did not present any symptoms. Differences were identified between positive and negative cases regarding the number of symptoms (p-value=0.001).Coughing was reported by 40.4% of positive individuals. Only 14.3% sought health care, namely 29.8% among those who tested positive and 13.3% among those who tested negative (p-value=0.001). Conclusion: The percentage of asymptomatic patients can impact the COVID-19 transmission chain in schools and fuel outbreaks of the disease in schools."
7476,"Comparison of clinical, para-clinical and laboratory findings in survived and deceased patients with COVID-19: diagnostic role of inflammatory indications in determining the severity of illness.","Background: Since December 2019, when a cluster of pneumonia cases due to SARS-CoV-2 initially emerged in Wuhan city and then rapidly spread throughout the world, the necessity for data concerning the clinical and para-clinical features of Iranian patients with COVID-19 was highlighted. Therefore, we aimed to compare the clinical, para-clinical and laboratory evidences of deceased patients with survival group. Methods: We extracted data regarding 233 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Buali Hospital in Iran; clinical/para-clinical and inflammatory indexes data were collected and analyzed. The data of laboratory examinations and chest CT findings were compared between deceased and survived patients. Results: The mean age of the patients was 49.8 years and 64% of our patients were male. The acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in 64 patients, 52 who were admitted to the ICU, which all of them underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 28 who died. Lymphopenia (79%), neutrophilia (79%), and thrombocytopenia (21%) were the most frequently observed laboratory findings of the deceased group on admission. Most patients (68%) had a high systematic immune-inflammation (SII) index of > 500 and increased C-reactive protein level (88%). Levels of inflammatory indexes such as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and SII were documented to be significantly elevated in the deceased group when compared with the patients who survived (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, P < 0.0001, respectively). The most commonly presented symptoms were fever (70%) and cough (63%) on admission. Headache was uncommon (11%). Ground-glass opacity with consolidation (mixed) was the most common radiologic finding on chest CT (51%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 15 of 204 patients (7%). Conclusion: Small fraction of patients with COVID-19 may present without fever and abnormal radiologic findings. Elevated NLR, PLR and SII can be considered as prognostic and risk stratifying factor of severe form of disease."
7477,The influence of the U.S. response to COVID-19 in Global Health.,"The American response to the pandemic involves a prominent volume of federal resources, especially for developing and acquiring products for internal use, such as diagnostics or vaccines. Investment mechanisms and historical aspects justify this expenditure. Thus, the social construction of nationalism in American society hinders access to health technologies. The review of such aspects shows how the United States (U.S.) secured a large number of potential products, ensuring excessive local production. This unilateral foreign policy has influenced other countries or regional blocs and undermined global cooperation and solidarity, affecting the collective health of several nations."

7479,From program suspension to the pandemic: A qualitative examination of Australia's vaccine pharmacovigilance system over 10 years.,"Background: In 2010, the Australian seasonal influenza vaccination program for children under 5 years of age was suspended due to an unexpected increase in fever and febrile convulsions causally associated with one particular influenza vaccine brand. A subsequent national review made seven recommendations to improve vaccine pharmacovigilance. Ten years on, in advance of implementing the COVID-19 immunisation program, we evaluated views on the capacity of Australia's vaccine pharmacovigilance system to promptly detect, examine and communicate a signal. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted between July and October 2020 with individuals with expertise in vaccine safety in Australia using an interview guide informed by key Australian and international frameworks. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to code data using a deductive approach. Results: Interviews with seventeen participants enabled six themes to be identified. Participants described improvement and significant innovation within Australia's vaccine pharmacovigilance system over the decade since 2010, particularly through establishment of a new active, cohort event monitoring system using short message service surveys. Participants thought Australia had a good foundation for COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance; implementation of the COVID-19 immunisation program was seen as a potential driver for ongoing enhancement through: a) improved integration of the active surveillance and spontaneous reporting systems, and; b) development of population-level active surveillance, including through data linkage. Transparent communication was considered essential to address the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19 and broader vaccine safety concerns. Conclusions: Vaccine safety experts in Australia convey confidence in the innovative pharmacovigilance systems implemented over the past 10 years. While Australia has a multifaceted system incorporating both active surveillance and spontaneous reporting systems, COVID-19 vaccine implementation represents an opportunity to enhance current systems and to develop new, systematic approaches to vaccine pharmacovigilance that should make both a local and global contribution."
