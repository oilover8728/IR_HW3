8030,COVID-19 vaccines: Knowing the unknown.,"Vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 has drawn attention around the globe due to the exploding pandemic. Although COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, previous research on other coronavirus vaccines, such as FIPV, SARS, and MERS, has provided valuable information for the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine. However, important knowledge gaps remain - some are specific to SARS-CoV-2, others are fundamental to immunology and vaccinology. Here, we discuss areas that need to be addressed for COVID-19 vaccine development, and what can be learned from examples of vaccine development in the past. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the research progress on COVID-19 has been remarkable. We are therefore optimistic about the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine."
8031,Whole-Genome Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from Quarantine Hotel Outbreak.,Hotel quarantine for international travelers has been used to prevent coronavirus disease spread into Australia. A quarantine hotel-associated community outbreak was detected in South Australia. Real-time genomic sequencing enabled rapid confirmation tracking the outbreak to a recently returned traveler and linked 2 cases of infection in travelers at the same facility.
8032,Airway Management for Emergent Surgeries during COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) performed in the operating room during general anesthesia and surgery can contaminate the operation room environment putting the anesthetist, surgeons and paramedical staff at risk of infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 has low sensitivity and is time-bound. Emergent surgical cases might not give ample time for SARS-CoV-2 evaluation. These issues have called for adaptation of an anesthesia technique that can ensure safety measures regarding airway management in emergent cases; and can limit the chances of viral spread in case the patient is a carrier of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this communication, we summarised the modifications required in anesthesia technique during intubation and extubation of a patient's airway that would decrease the risk of virus transmission to the operation theatre staff. Key Words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Emergent surgeries, Anesthesia technique."
8033,"""Mass gathering events and COVID-19 transmission in Borriana (Spain): A retrospective cohort study"".","Objective: Mass gathering events (MGEs) are associated with the transmission of COVID-19. Between 6 and 10 March 2020, several MGEs related to the Falles festival took place in Borriana, a municipality in the province of Castellon (Spain). The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 and its association with these MGEs, and to quantify the potential risk factors of its occurrence. Methods: During May and June 2020, a population-based retrospective cohort study was carried out by the Public Health Center of Castell√≥ and the Hospital de la Plana in Vila-real. Participants were obtained from a representative sample of 1663 people with potential exposure at six MGEs. A questionnaire survey was carried out to obtain information about attendance at MGEs and COVID-19 disease. In addition, a serologic survey of antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 was implemented. Inverse probability weighted regression was used in the statistical analysis. Results: A total of 1338 subjects participated in the questionnaire survey (80.5%), 997 of whom undertook the serologic survey. Five hundred and seventy cases were observed with an attack rate (AR) of 42.6%; average age was 36 years, 62.3% were female, 536 cases were confirmed by laboratory tests, and 514 cases were found with SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies. Considering MGE exposure, AR was 39.2% (496/1264). A dose-response relationship was found between MGE attendance and the disease, (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 4.11 95% confidence interval [CI]3.25-5.19). Two MGEs with a dinner and dance in the same building had higher risks. Associated risk factors with the incidence were older age, obesity, and upper and middle class versus lower class; current smoking was protective. Conclusions: The study suggests the significance of MGEs in the COVID-19 transmission that could explain the subsequent outbreak in Borriana."
8034,SARS CoV-2 infections in healthcare workers with a pre-existing T-cell response: a prospective cohort study.,"Objective: T-cell responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are observed in unexposed individuals. We evaluated the impact of this pre-existing cellular response on incident SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods: This was a follow-up study of 38 seronegative healthcare workers (HCWs) with previous evaluation of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. Infection was considered in the presence of a positive RT-PCR test and/or confirmed seroconversion. Results: Twenty of the 38 HCWs included (53%) had a previous specific CD8+ T-cell response to peptides encompassing the spike protein (S) in 13 (34%), the membrane (M) in 17 (45%), or/and the nucleocapsid (N) in three (8%). During a follow-up of 189 days (interquartile range (IQR) 172-195), 11 HCWs (29%) had an RT-PCR-positive test (n = 9) or seroconverted (n = 2). Median duration of symptoms was 2 days (IQR 0-7), and time to negative RT-PCR was 9 days (IQR 4-10). Notably, six incident infections (55%) occurred in HCWs with a pre-existing T-cell response (30% of those with a cellular response), who showed a significantly lower duration of symptoms (three were asymptomatic). Three of the six HCWs having a previous T-cell response continued to test seronegative. All the infected patients developed a robust T-cell response to different structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, especially to protein S (91%). Conclusion: A pre-existing T-cell response does not seem to reduce incident SARS-CoV-2 infections, but it may contribute to asymptomatic or mild disease, rapid viral clearance and differences in seroconversion."

8036,Taiwan Government-Guided Strategies Contributed to Combating and Controlling COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious, and thus has become an emerging health crisis worldwide. The optimal strategies to prevent the spread of this disease are inconclusive, and therefore, the adopted measurements to combat COVID-19 varies in different countries. In mid-March and late-August 2020, we performed internet searches to collect relevant information, from sources such as the website of the World Health Organization. The epidemiological data of COVID-19 from several countries were collected and we found that Taiwan had a comparably successful story for combating the pandemic. As of mid-March, Taiwan had high rates of diagnostic testing (688.5 tests per million citizens) with a lower infection rate (49 cases, 2.1 cases per million people). As of late-August, there were 488 cases (20 cases per million people). Furthermore, Taiwanese government-guided strategies and hospital data were also reviewed. We summarized some important strategies to combat COVID-19, which include: (1) border control; (2) official media channel and press conferences; (3) name-based rationing system for medical masks; (4) TOCC-based rapid triage, outdoor clinics, and protective sampling devices; and (5) social distancing, delaying the start of new semesters, and religious assembly restriction. In conclusion, Taiwan had lower rates of COVID-19 compared with other countries, and Taiwan government-guided strategies contributed to the control of the disease's spread."
8037,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2: Current advances in therapeutic targets and drug development.,"The current pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has quickly emerged as a global health concern with government bodies worldwide taking drastic control measures. Understanding the virology of SARS-CoV-2, its molecular mechanisms, and its pathogenesis are required for a targeted therapeutic approach. In this review, we highlight the current molecular and drug advances that target SARS-CoV-2 at the genome level. We also summarize studies that therapeutically target the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and proteases. Finally, we summarize antibody-mediated therapeutic approaches, as well as recent trends in vaccine development. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate different molecular targets in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and their usefulness in developing strategies for drug development."
8038,Risk of hospital admission for patients with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7: cohort analysis.,"Objective: To evaluate the relation between diagnosis of covid-19 with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 (also known as variant of concern 202012/01) and the risk of hospital admission compared with diagnosis with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 variants. Design: Retrospective cohort analysis. Setting: Community based SARS-CoV-2 testing in England, individually linked with hospital admission data. Participants: 839 278 patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19, of whom 36 233 had been admitted to hospital within 14 days, tested between 23 November 2020 and 31 January 2021 and analysed at a laboratory with an available TaqPath assay that enables assessment of S-gene target failure (SGTF), a proxy test for the B.1.1.7 variant. Patient data were stratified by age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, region of residence, and date of positive test. Main outcome measures: Hospital admission between one and 14 days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Results: 27 710 (4.7%) of 592 409 patients with SGTF variants and 8523 (3.5%) of 246 869 patients without SGTF variants had been admitted to hospital within one to 14 days. The stratum adjusted hazard ratio of hospital admission was 1.52 (95% confidence interval 1.47 to 1.57) for patients with covid-19 infected with SGTF variants, compared with those infected with non-SGTF variants. The effect was modified by age (P<0.001), with hazard ratios of 0.93-1.21 in patients younger than 20 years with versus without SGTF variants, 1.29 in those aged 20-29, and 1.45-1.65 in those aged ‚â•30 years. The adjusted absolute risk of hospital admission within 14 days was 4.7% (95% confidence interval 4.6% to 4.7%) for patients with SGTF variants and 3.5% (3.4% to 3.5%) for those with non-SGTF variants. Conclusions: The results suggest that the risk of hospital admission is higher for people infected with the B.1.1.7 variant compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2, likely reflecting a more severe disease. The higher severity may be specific to adults older than 30 years."
8039,Outcomes of elective head and neck confirmed or suspected cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Purpose: To analyse the complication outcomes of COVID-19 negative patients undergoing elective head and neck surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a retrospective case review of all patients undergoing elective head and neck surgery for confirmed or suspected head and neck cancer. Results: There were no mortalities recorded in the cohort of patients analysed. At 30 days, pulmonary complications had occurred in 4 patients (9%). None of these were related to COVID infection. Conclusion: With careful pre-operative screening of patients for COVID-19 and post-operative care in a COVID-19 clean ward, head and neck surgery can proceed safely during the epidemic. This data could help to minimise delay in treatment by allowing a greater number of elective head and neck cancer operations to proceed."
