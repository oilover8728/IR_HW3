8800,SARS-CoV-2: Combating Coronavirus Emergence.,"The emergence and rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 mark the third such identification of a novel coronavirus capable of causing severe, potentially fatal disease in humans in the 21st century. As noted by Andersen et al. (Nature Medicine), the sequencing of proximal zoonotic ancestors to SARS-CoV-2 has aided in the identification of alleles that may contribute to the virus' virulence in humans."
8801,Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals key epigenetic targets in SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"COVID-19 is an infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2), which has caused a global outbreak. Current research efforts are focused on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to propose drug-based therapeutic options. Transcriptional changes due to epigenetic regulation are key host cell responses to viral infection and have been studied in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; however, such changes are not fully described for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we analyzed multiple transcriptomes obtained from cell lines infected with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and from COVID-19 patient-derived samples. Using integrative analyses of gene co-expression networks and de-novo pathway enrichment, we characterize different gene modules and protein pathways enriched with Transcription Factors or Epifactors relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified EP300, MOV10, RELA, and TRIM25 as top candidates, and more than 60 additional proteins involved in the epigenetic response during viral infection that has therapeutic potential. Our results show that targeting the epigenetic machinery could be a feasible alternative to treat COVID-19."
8802,The impact of spike N501Y mutation on neutralizing activity and RBD binding of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum.,"Background: Several SARS-CoV-2 lineages with spike receptor binding domain (RBD) N501Y mutation have spread globally. We evaluated the impact of N501Y on neutralizing activity of COVID-19 convalescent sera and on anti-RBD IgG assays. Methods: The susceptibility to neutralization by COVID-19 patients' convalescent sera from Hong Kong were compared between two SARS-CoV-2 isolates (B117-1/B117-2) from the α variant with N501Y and 4 non-N501Y isolates. The effect of N501Y on antibody binding was assessed. The performance of commercially-available IgG assays was determined for patients infected with N501Y variants. Findings: The microneutralization antibody (MN) titers of convalescent sera from 9 recovered COVID-19 patients against B117-1 (geometric mean titer[GMT],80; 95% CI, 47-136) were similar to those against the non-N501Y viruses. However, MN titer of these serum against B117-2 (GMT, 20; 95% CI, 11-36) was statistically significantly reduced when compared with non-N501Y viruses (P < 0.01; one-way ANOVA). The difference between B117-1 and B117-2 was confirmed by testing 60 additional convalescent sera. B117-1 and B117-2 differ by only 3 amino acids (nsp2-S512Y, nsp13-K460R, spike-A1056V). Enzyme immunoassay using 272 convalescent sera showed reduced binding of anti-RBD IgG to N501Y or N501Y-E484K-K417N when compared with that of wild-type RBD (mean difference: 0.1116 and 0.5613, respectively; one-way ANOVA). Of 7 anti-N-IgG positive sera from patients infected with N501Y variants (collected 9-14 days post symptom onset), 6 (85.7%) tested negative for a commercially-available anti-S1-IgG assay. Funding: Richard and Carol Yu, Michael Tong, and the Government Consultancy Service (see acknowledgments for full list). Interpretation: We highlighted the importance of using a panel of viruses within the same lineage to determine the impact of virus variants on neutralization. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware of the potential reduced sensitivity of anti-RBD IgG assays."
8803,How strong is the evidence that it is possible to get SARS-CoV-2 twice? A systematic review.,"With a large number of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients being discharged from hospital with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2, it has been reported that several recovered cases tested positive after discharge (re-positive, RP). This finding has raised several important questions for this novel coronavirus and Covid-19 disease. In this review, we have discussed several important questions, including: (1) Can the virus re-infect recovered individuals? (2) What are the possible causes of the re-positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in recovered patients? (3) What are the implications of these re-positive cases concerning the spread of the virus? Understanding how recovery from Covid-19 confers immunity to decrease the risk of re-infection is needed to inform current efforts to safely scale back population-based interventions, such as physical distancing. We have also described what is currently known about the immune response to Covid-19, highlighted key gaps in knowledge, and identified opportunities for future research. Overall, the quality of the evidence is poor and we describe the features that should be described for future cases."
8804,Comparison of the diagnostic sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and glycoprotein-based antibody tests.,"The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) has been followed by the rapid development of antibody tests. To assess the utility of the tests for clinical use and seroepidemiologic studies, we examined the sensitivity of commercial antibody tests from Roche, Abbott, Novatec, Virotech Siemens, Euroimmun, and Mediagnost in a prospective diagnostic study. The tests were evaluated with 73 sera from SARS CoV-2 RNA positive individuals with mild to moderate disease or asymptomatic infection. Sera were obtained at 2-3 weeks (N = 25) or > 4 weeks (N = 48) after symptom onset and viral RNA test. The overall sensitivity of the tests ranged from 64.4-93.2%. The most sensitive assays recognized 95.8-100 % of the sera obtained after 4 weeks or later. Sera drawn at 2-3 weeks were recognized with lower sensitivity indicating that the optimal time point for serologic testing is later than 3 weeks after onset of the disease. Nucleoprotein- and glycoproteinbased assays had similar sensitivity indicating that tests with both antigens are suitable for serological diagnostics. Breakdown of the test results showed that nucleoprotein- and glycoprotein-based tests of comparable sensitivity reacted with different sets of sera. The observation indicates that a combination of nucleoprotein- and glycoprotein-based tests would increase the percentage of positive results."
8805,"[Pandemie COVID-19, sommeil et sequelles psychologiques: au nom du Reseau canadien du sommeil et des rythmes circadiens* et de la Societe canadienne du sommeil*].","Les données recueillies lors de crises et tragédies passées prouvent que les problèmes de sommeil survenant durant ou peu de temps après un événement traumatique sont reliés à une probabilité accrue de développer des symptômes psychiatriques durables. Or la pandémie COVID-19 et ses conséquences à moyen et long-terme combinent plusieurs facteurs de risque pour le sommeil, tant pour les intervenants de la santé que la population générale. Notre relevé mensuel des publications scientifiques qui combinent COVID-19 et sommeil/insomnie entre janvier et juillet 2020 révèle un taux de croissance comparable pour les articles qui portent plus précisément sur la santé mentale mais aucune ne porte sur les résultats d’une intervention. Nous proposons qu’il faille agir rapidement sur les difficultés de sommeil en cette période de pandémie afin de protéger l’équilibre psychologique individuel à moyen et long terme, d’autant plus que les outils nécessaires à la prévention de l’insomnie, sa détection et son traitement sont à la portée de tous les professionnels de la santé mentale."

8809,Remdesivir (GS-5734) as a therapeutic option of 2019-nCOV main protease - in silico approach.,"2019 - Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV), enclosed large genome positive-sense RNA virus characterized by crown-like spikes that protrude from their surface, and have a distinctive replication strategy. The 2019-nCOV belongs to the Coronaviridae family, principally consists of virulent pathogens showing zoonotic property, has emerged as a pandemic outbreak with high mortality and high morbidity rate around the globe and no therapeutic vaccine or drugs against 2019-nCoV are discovered till now. In this study, in silico methods and algorithms were used for sequence, structure analysis and molecular docking on Mpro of 2019-nCOV. The co-crystal structure of 2019-nCOV protease, 6LU7 have ∼99% identity with SARS-CoV protease. The 6LU7 residues, Cys145 and His164 are playing a significant role in replication and are essential for the survival of 2019-nCOV. Alongside, 2019-nCOV Mpro sequence is non-homologous to human host-pathogen. Complete genome sequence analysis, structural and molecular docking results revealed that Remdesivir is having a better binding affinity with -8.2 kcal/mol than the rest of protease inhibitors, and peptide. Remdesivir is strongly forming h-bonds with crucial Mpro residues, Cys145, and His164. Further, MD simulation analysis also confirmed, that these residues are forming H-bond with Remdesivir during 100 ns simulations run and found stable (∼99%) by RMSD and RMSF. Thus, present in silico study at molecular approaches suggest that, Remdesivir is a potent therapeutic inhibitor against 2019-nCoV.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
