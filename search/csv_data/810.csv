8090,Clinical differences in chest CT characteristics between the progression and remission stages of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.,"Introduction: Computed tomography (CT) can be effective for the early screening and diagnosis of COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the distinctive CT characteristics of two stages of the disease (progression and remission). Methods: We included all COVID-19 patients admitted to Wenzhou Central Hospital from January to February, 2020. Patients underwent multiple chest CT scans at intervals of 3-10 days. CT features were recorded, such as the lesion lobe, distribution characteristics (subpleural, scattered or diffused), shape of the lesion, maximum size of the lesion, lesion morphology (ground-glass opacity, GGO) and consolidation features. When consolidation was positive, the boundary was identified to determine its clarity. Results: The ratios of some representative features differed between the remission stage and the progression phase, such as round-shape lesion (8.0% vs 34.4%), GGO (65.0% vs 87.5%), consolidation (62.0% vs 31.3%), large cable sign (59.0% vs 9.4%) and crazy-paving sign (20.0% vs 50.0%). Using these features, we pooled all the CT data (n = 132) and established a logistic regression model to predict the current development stage. The variables consolidation, boundary feature, large cable sign and crazy-paving sign were the most significant factors, based on a variable named ""prediction of progression or remission"" (PPR) that we constructed. The ROC curve showed that PPR had an AUC of 0.882 (cutoff value = 0.66, sensitivity = 0.75, specificity = 0.875). Conclusion: CT characteristics, in particular, round shape, GGO, consolidation, large cable sign, and crazy-paving sign, may increase the recognition of the intrapulmonary development of COVID-19."
8091,"Immunity, endothelial injury and complement-induced coagulopathy in COVID-19.","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was isolated from the respiratory epithelium of patients with unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, China. This pathogen, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a pathogenic condition that has been termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has reached pandemic proportions. As of 17 September 2020, more than 30 million confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in 204 different countries, claiming more than 1 million lives worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a variety of clinical conditions, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening cases. In the early stages of the disease, most patients experience mild clinical symptoms, including a high fever and dry cough. However, 20% of patients rapidly progress to severe illness characterized by atypical interstitial bilateral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Almost 10% of these critically ill patients subsequently die. Insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 progression are emerging and highlight the critical role of the immunological hyper-response - characterized by widespread endothelial damage, complement-induced blood clotting and systemic microangiopathy - in disease exacerbation. These insights may aid the identification of new or existing therapeutic interventions to limit the progression of early disease and treat severe cases."

We found 6 cases of apparent human-to-feline transmission involving healthy cats. Virus genomes sequenced from 1 cat and its owner were identical."

8095,Evaluation of the relation between cardiac biomarkers and thorax computed tomography findings in COVID-19 patients.,"Background: Troponin levels may be elevated in COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study was to the explore relation between troponin levels and COVID-19 severity. Materials, methods & Results: One hundred and forty consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included. Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on positive chest computed tomography (CT) findings. Quantitative PCR test was performed in all patients. Only 74 patients were quantitative PCR-positive. Twenty four patients had severe CT findings and 27 patients had progressive disease. These patients had significantly lower albumin and higher ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with severe CT findings and progressive disease had higher hs-cTnI levels suggesting the use of hs-cTnI in risk stratification."

8097,"Genomic Evolution and Variation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Early Phase of COVID-19 Pandemic in Guangdong Province, China.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with unknown origin spread rapidly to 222 countries, areas or territories. To investigate the genomic evolution and variation in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic in Guangdong, 60 specimens of SARS-CoV-2 were used to perform whole genome sequencing, and genomics, amino acid variation and Spike protein structure modeling analyses. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the early variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome was still intra-species, with no evolution to other coronaviruses. There were one to seven nucleotide variations (SNVs) in each genome and all SNVs were distributed in various fragments of the genome. The Spike protein bound with human receptor, an amino acid salt bridge and a potential furin cleavage site were found in the SARS-CoV-2 using molecular modeling. Our study clarified the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 genomic evolution, variation and Spike protein structure in the early phase of local cases in Guangdong, which provided reference for generating prevention and control strategies and tracing the source of new outbreaks."
8098,Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Host Cell Entry Factors in Immune System Components of Healthy Individuals and Its Relevance for COVID-19 Immunopathology.,"Intense immunological dysregulation including immune cell lesions has been characteristically observed in severe cases of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), for which molecular mechanisms are not properly understood. A study of physiological expressions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) host cell entry-related factors in immune system components may help explain molecular mechanisms involved in COVID-19 immunopathology. We analyzed transcriptomic and proteomic expression metadata for SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2 and entry associated proteases (TMPRSS2, CTSL, and FURIN) in silico across immune system components including the blood lineage cells. ACE2 was not detected in any of the studied immune cell components; however, varying transcriptomic and proteomic expressions were observed for TMPRSS2, CTSL, and FURIN. Nondetectable expressions of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2 in immune system components or blood lineage cells indicate it does not mediate immune cell lesions in COVID-19. Alternative mechanisms need to be explored for COVID-19 immunopathogenesis."
