5661,Safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in multiple sclerosis patients.,"COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for multiple sclerosis patients. Disease-modifying therapies can influence the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. RNA, DNA, protein, and inactivated vaccines are likely safe for multiple sclerosis patients. A few incidences of central demyelination were reported with viral vector vaccines, but their benefits likely outweigh their risks if alternatives are unavailable. Live-attenuated vaccines should be avoided whenever possible in treated patients. Interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, fumarates, and natalizumab are not expected to impact vaccine efficacy, while cell-depleting agents (ocrelizumab, rituximab, ofatumumab, alemtuzumab, and cladribine) and sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators will likely attenuate vaccine responses. Coordinating vaccine timing with dosing regimens for some therapies may optimize vaccine efficacy."
5662,Evaluation of four laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody immunoassays.,"Objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic performances of four SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody immunoassays. Methods: Following immunoassays were studied: Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, Diasorin's Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S2/S2 IgG assay, Euroimmun's Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, and Roche's Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Specificity was retrospectively evaluated with 38 samples from 2019. Sensitivity samples (n = 147) were taken from SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR-positive patients who developed COVID-19 symptoms ten days earlier. Results: Mean specificity was 96.6%. Mean sensitivity was 62.7% from ten days after onset of symptoms, 84.4% from 15 days after onset of symptoms, and 87.5% from 20 days after onset of symptoms. Conclusions: Specificity was high, while Abbott and Roche were 100% specific. Sensitivity increased over time, with Abbott and Roche having the highest sensitivity at all time points with â‰¥90% from 20 days after symptoms' onset. These findings may assist in selecting SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody immunoassays for additional diagnostics, epidemiological research, and vaccine development."
5663,Is there a role for childhood vaccination against COVID-19?,"Tremendous efforts are undertaken to quickly develop COVID-19 vaccines that protect vulnerable individuals from severe disease and thereby limit the health and socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic. Potential candidates are tested in adult populations, and questions arise of whether COVID-19 vaccination should be implemented in children. Compared to adults, the incidence and disease severity of COVID-19 are low in children, and despite their infectiveness, their role in disease propagation is limited. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccines will need to have fully demonstrated safety and efficacy in preventing not only complications but transmission to justify childhood vaccination. This work summarizes currently tested vaccine platforms and debates practical and ethical considerations for their potential use in children. It also discusses the already deleterious effect of the pandemic on routine childhood vaccine coverage, calling for action to limit the risks for a rise in vaccine-preventable diseases."

5665,COVID-19 in African Countries versus other World Regions: A Review.,"This review examines the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus) in Africa. By May 15, 2020, while the COVID-19 infections were 1,741,129 in Europe, 1,632,167 in North America, 757,924 in Asia, 401,072 in South America, there were only 79,780 infections in Africa, a continent with 1.34 billion people. During this same date, of the total COVID-19 deaths of 308,154 worldwide, Europe accounted for 160,482 (52.1%) deaths; North America accounted for 99,633 (32.3%) deaths; Asia accounted for 23,963 (7.8%) deaths; South America accounted for 21,303 (6.9%) deaths; and Africa accounted for only 2,639 (0.9%) deaths. Among the factors cited for this phenomenon (Africa's low figures) are: low volumes of international tourism to most African nations; a relatively young African population, with 533.5 (39.8%) million under the age of 15; low obesity rates in Africa; low rates of urbanization in most African nations; hot or high temperatures and high humidity in most African nations; low levels of testing, which continues to be the case in countries all across the world and proactive measures by African governments and people to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It is recommended that African countries continue to pursue proactive measures such as use of facemasks, hand sanitizers, regular hand washing and immediate partial or full lockdown when necessary."

5667,Real-World Evidence for Assessing Pharmaceutical Treatments in the Context of COVID-19.,"The emergence and global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an urgent need for evidence on medical interventions and outcomes of the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 are already in progress, the number of clinical questions of interest greatly outpaces the available resources to conduct RCTs. Therefore, there is growing interest in whether nonrandomized real-world evidence (RWE) can be used to supplement RCT evidence and aid in clinical decision making, but concerns about nonrandomized RWE have been highlighted by a proliferation of RWE studies on medications and COVID-19 outcomes with widely varying conclusions. The objective of this paper is to review some clinical questions of interest, potential data types, challenges, and merits of RWE in COVID-19, resulting in recommendations for nonrandomized RWE designs and analyses based on established RWE principles."

5669,Engineered SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain improves manufacturability in yeast and immunogenicity in mice.,"Global containment of COVID-19 still requires accessible and affordable vaccines for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Recently approved vaccines provide needed interventions, albeit at prices that may limit their global access. Subunit vaccines based on recombinant proteins are suited for large-volume microbial manufacturing to yield billions of doses annually, minimizing their manufacturing cost. These types of vaccines are well-established, proven interventions with multiple safe and efficacious commercial examples. Many vaccine candidates of this type for SARS-CoV-2 rely on sequences containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates viral entry to cells via ACE2. Here we report an engineered sequence variant of RBD that exhibits high-yield manufacturability, high-affinity binding to ACE2, and enhanced immunogenicity after a single dose in mice compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 variant used in current vaccines. Antibodies raised against the engineered protein exhibited heterotypic binding to the RBD from two recently reported SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (501Y.V1/V2). Presentation of the engineered RBD on a designed virus-like particle (VLP) also reduced weight loss in hamsters upon viral challenge."
