3030,Transmission and Protection against Reinfection in the Ferret Model with the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 Reference Isolate.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has initiated a global pandemic, and several vaccines have now received emergency use authorization. Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semipermissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of viral RNA (vRNA) at multiple time points, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in 2 respective studies, while respiratory droplet transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To determine if previously infected ferrets were protected against reinfection, ferrets were rechallenged 28 or 56 days postinfection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined, these studies demonstrate direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate in ferrets and that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity. IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show that the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against reinfection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, these studies suggest that protection of the upper respiratory tract will require vaccine approaches that mimic natural infection."
3031,Tolerance of BNT162b2 mRNA COVI-19 vaccine in patients with a medical history of COVID-19 disease: A case control study.,"Introduction: Studies evaluating BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine safety excluded subjects with a previous history of COVID-19 infection. The aim of our study was to focus on the tolerance of this vaccine this population. Methods: An anonymous self-reporting survey related to safety and tolerance of vaccine was completed by subjects 21 to 28 days after the first vaccine dose in two vaccination centers. Results: Subjects with prior COVID-19 disease history (n = 61) had higher systemic reactions than subjects without any previous history (n = 1987) (45.9% vs 29.7%, p = 0.01). Asthenia, headache and fever were significantly more frequent in COVID-19 + group than negative group (25.6% vs 15.2% p = 0.045, 19.7% vs 9.3% p = 0.01, 6.5% vs 0.9% p = 0.003 respectively). Grade of severity was higher in COVID-19 + than in COVID-19 - group (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our study confirms a higher risk of side effects in patients with preexisting SARS-CoV-2 disease but with a good overall tolerance."

3034,How to (ab)use a COVID-19 antigen rapid test with soft drinks?,"With reasonably good specificity and sensitivity, the speed and convenience of COVID-19 antigen tests have led to self-testing in schools, offices, and universities in the European Union (EU). Although self-testing can be beneficial and increase the accessibility to testing, there are potential ways to confound a positive COVID-19 lateral flow test. We observed that all soft drinks, energy drinks, alcoholic beverages (vodka, whiskey, and brandy), commercially bottled mineral water, and carbonated mineral water caused the appearance of a red test line. However, when equal volumes of the buffer and the respective beverages are mixed, there are no false-positive test lines. Deceitful methods may easily lead to misuse of COVID-19 antigen rapid tests and lead to false-positive results; however, this does not prove that these tests are unreliable when performed correctly."

We modelled the benefits and risks of Vaxzevria distribution from May to September 2021 in metropolitan France where other vaccines are available, considering French hospitalisation data and European data on TTS. Across different scenarios, benefits of Vaxzevria distribution in people 55 years and older exceeded the risk of death from COVID-19. In young adults, risks were at least of similar magnitude as benefits."

3038,Challenges in COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Objective: In this narrative review, our aim was to clarify the roles of diagnostic methods used in COVID-19 disease. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirusis emerged as the major healthcare challenge globally. The mainstay approach to limit this virus spread is an early and accurate diagnosis of the viral infection and appropriate quarantine of patients with coronavirus infection. Results: Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a quick detection of the disease in either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. In literature, there are numerous studies that underline the importance of CT as the first-step diagnostic tool in COVID-19 diagnosis. Even in asymptomatic patients, COVID-19 pneumonia may manifest with chest CT imaging abnormalities. Conclusion: There is a need for an algorithm, which involves a combination of PCR and CT in diagnosis of COVID-19 (Ref. 85)."
