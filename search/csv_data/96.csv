950,Development of a quantitative one-step multiplex RT-qPCR assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a biological matrix.,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in China in late 2019. The rapid viral spread has made the disease a public health emergency of worldwide concern. The gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 is reverse transcription followed by qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR); however, the role of viral load quantification has not been thoroughly investigated yet. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a high-precision quantitative one-step RT-qPCR reaction using the association of the viral target and the human target in the same reaction. Methods: The assay standardization involved the absolute quantification method, with serial dilutions of a plasmid with the N gene in a biological matrix to build a standard curve. Results and discussion: The results demonstrated the possibility of quantifying as few as 2.5 copies/reaction and an analysis of 244 patients with known results selected by cross-section that revealed 100% agreement with a qualitative RT-qPCR assay registered by Anvisa. In this population, it was possible to quantify patients with between 2.59 and 3.5 Ã— 107 copies per reaction and negative patients continued to indicate the same result. Conclusion: This assay can be a useful tool for a proper patient management, because the level and duration of viral replication are important factors to assess the risk of transmission and to guide decisions regarding the isolation and release of patients; an accurate diagnosis is critical information, whereas the current COVID-19 pandemic represents the biggest current global health problem."
951,Validation of COVID-19 serologic tests and large scale screening of asymptomatic healthcare workers.,"Objectives: Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an important element in the fight to slow the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to validate two serologic tests for total (IgM, IgG, IgA) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, (i) the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody assay for the Vitros 5600 analyzers and (ii) a manual laboratory developed ELISA (FDA EUA pending), for use in parallel orthogonal testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers and affiliates of the University of Maryland Medical System. Design and methods: Validation and verification of the two tests was performed using samples from hospitalized patients that were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, samples pre-COVID-19, and samples from individuals with current/previous infections with other viruses. Healthcare workers and affiliates from across the University of Maryland Health System were provided testing free of charge and their results were reported as reactive or non-reactive if the two tests were concordance, or indeterminate if the results were discordant. Results: Validation testing found the Ortho Vitros test to be 100% (73/73) sensitive, and 99.3% (152/153) specific, while the UMMC ELISA was found to be 97.6% (204/209) sensitive and 100% (288/288) specific. Real world testing among 8399 healthcare workers found that 2.9% (247/8399) of healthcare workers were positive for anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by both tests. An indeterminate rate of 1.1% (91/8399), in which one test reported reactive results, and one as non-reactive was also seen. Conclusions: Parallel orthogonal testing improves the positive and negative predictive value of serologic testing in populations with low prevalence. The use of an indeterminate result from parallel orthogonal testing allows for the follow-up and re-testing, which helps resolve discrepancies between assays."
952,COVID-19 vaccine: where are we now and where should we go?,"Introduction: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has currently caused the pandemic with a high progressive speed and has been considered as the global public health crisis in 2020. This new member of the coronavirus family has created a potentially fatal disease, called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Despite the continuous efforts of researchers to find effective vaccines and drugs for COVID-19, there is still no success in this matter. Areas covered: Here, the literature regarding the COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in the clinical trials, as well as main candidates in pre-clinical stages for development and research, were reviewed. These candidates have been developed under five different major platforms, including live-attenuated vaccine, mRNA-based vaccine, DNA vaccines, inactivated virus, and viral-vector-based vaccine. Expert opinion: There are several limitations in the field of the rapid vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2, and other members of the coronavirus family such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The key challenges of designing an effective vaccine within a short time include finding the virulence ability of an emerging virus and potential antigen, choosing suitable experimental models and efficient route of administration, the immune-response study, designing the clinical trials, and determining the safety, as well as efficacy."
953,An Algorithm for Ramp Up of Ophthalmic Elective Surgeries Post-COVID-19.,"Purpose: As ophthalmic elective surgeries resume amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, protocols for testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important due to the transmissibility of the virus. Here, we describe the protocol our institution has implemented for screening asymptomatic patients before proceeding to elective ophthalmic surgery. Methods: A retrospective chart review analyzed the number of elective surgeries, results of SARS-CoV-2 testing, and the effect of a positive result on surgery scheduling. Results: We display the screening protocol our institution used to test for SARS-CoV-2. Through its implementation, we found 2 asymptomatic patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 resulting in cancellation of their surgeries. Conclusion: Because of the possibility of positive COVID-19 status in asymptomatic patients and the risk this poses to patients and staff, we recommend testing all asymptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 prior to elective surgeries."

955,Will SARS-CoV-2 Become Just Another Seasonal Coronavirus?,"The future prevalence and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. Some emerging pathogens become avirulent as populations approach herd immunity. Although not all viruses follow this path, the fact that the seasonal coronaviruses are benign gives some hope. We develop a general mathematical model to predict when the interplay among three factors, correlation of severity in consecutive infections, population heterogeneity in susceptibility due to age, and reduced severity due to partial immunity, will promote avirulence as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic. Each of these components has the potential to limit severe, high-shedding cases over time under the right circumstances, but in combination they can rapidly reduce the frequency of more severe and infectious manifestation of disease over a wide range of conditions. As more reinfections are captured in data over the next several years, these models will help to test if COVID-19 severity is beginning to attenuate in the ways our model predicts, and to predict the disease."
956,Gastrointestinal mucosal immunity and COVID-19.,"As the gastrointestinal tract may also be a crucial entry or interaction site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the role of the gut mucosal immune system as a first-line physical and immunological defense is critical. Furthermore, gastrointestinal involvement and symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been linked to worse clinical outcomes. This review discusses recent data on the interactions between the virus and the immune cells and molecules in the mucosa during the infection. By carrying out appropriate investigations, the mucosal immune system role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in therapy and prevention can be established. In line with this, COVID-19 vaccines that stimulate mucosal immunity against the virus may have more advantages than the others."
957,The Importance of Advancing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Vaccines in Children.,"While the role of children in the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains to be defined, children likely play an important role based on our knowledge of other respiratory viruses. Children are more likely to be asymptomatic or have milder symptoms and less likely to present for healthcare and be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, our current estimates are likely under-representative of the true burden of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Given the potential direct benefit of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in children and the substantial indirect benefit through community protection, or ""herd immunity,"" we argue that planning and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should include children. Furthermore, community protection occurred after widespread implementation of prior childhood vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, rubella, and rotavirus. We detail considerations for vaccine clinical trials, potential barriers to the implementation of widespread vaccination and argue why children would be an ideal target population for vaccination."

959,Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 testing in children during a low prevalence period (VIGIL study 1).,"Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 induces a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, which overlap with other viral infections very common in children. We aimed to describe the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests in symptomatic and asymptomatic ambulatory children and to determine the predictive factors for positivity. Patients and methods: From June 1 to July 31, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional prospective, multicenter study (13 hospital emergency units and 59 ambulatory pediatricians) throughout France. Children under 15 years of age with a prescription of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test were enrolled. Results: Among the 1,553 RT-PCR tests, 22 were positive (1.4%; 95%CI [0.9; 2.1]). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the predictive factors for positivity were age below 2 years (OR: 4.5 [1.6; 12.7]) and history of contact (OR: 12.3 [4.6; 32.8]). Conclusions: In an epidemic stage with low SARS-CoV-2 circulation, sampling of children with nonspecific symptoms and without known contact could be questioned."
