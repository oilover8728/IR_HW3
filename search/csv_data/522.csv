5210,[Analysis of CT features of 15 children with 2019 novel coronavirus infection].,"Objective: To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection. They were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, 5 were males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on the first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammatory lesions. Seven cases had small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases had speckled ground glass opacities. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. The remaining 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important."
5211,Chinese consumers' willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay for it.,"A COVID-19 vaccine is the key to beating the virus, and effective vaccines are going to be available in the near future. It is urgent to estimate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and their value to individuals, in order to develop an effective public vaccination strategy. Based on a survey of 1,188 randomly selected respondents in China, we analyzed Chinese consumers' willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine and their willingness to pay for it. We find that 79.41% of the respondents are willing to get vaccinated in China, and the average amount that they're willing to pay for a COVID-19 vaccine shot is 130.45 yuan. However, though the elderly are at higher risk of infection and the disease could be fatal for them, they are less willing to get the vaccine and not willing to pay as much for the shot. Subsidies and health communication concerning COVID-19 vaccines should be provided in order to expand vaccination coverage."
5212,Characterization of humoral response to COVID mRNA vaccines in multiple sclerosis patients on disease modifying therapies.,"Little is known about COVID-19 mRNA vaccine humoral immune responses in patients with central nervous system autoimmune demyelinating diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO), who are on B-cell depleting therapies (BCDT) and other disease modifying therapies (DMTs). We conducted a single center prospective study to identify the clinical and immunological features associated with vaccine-induced antibody response in 53 participants before and after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. This is the first report on the anti-spike RBD and anti-nucleocapsid antibody response, along with pre- and post-vaccine absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) and flow cytometry analysis of CD19 and CD20 lymphocytes in patients with MS and NMO. We tested the hypothesis that patients on BCDT may have impaired COVID-19 vaccine humoral responses. Among patients on BCDT, 36.4% demonstrated a positive antibody response to spike RBD, in comparison to 100% in all other groups such as healthy controls, untreated MS, and patients on non-B cell depleting DMTs (p < 0.0001). Immunological data revealed lower baseline (pre-vaccination) levels of IgM in patients on BCDT (p = 0.003). Low CD19 and CD20 counts and a shorter interval from the last B cell depleting therapy infusion to the first vaccine dose were associated with a negative spike RBD antibody response (non-seroconverter) in patients on BCDT. Age, body mass index (BMI) and total treatment duration did not differ between seroconverters and non-seroconverters."
5213,"COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 10 (Reporting week to 23:59 AEST 5 April 2020).","Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 5 April 2020: Notifications = 5,805; Deaths = 33. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases are able to be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically link. The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. Early indications are that reduction in international travel, domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action are slowing the spread of the disease. Internationally, cases continue to increase, with high rates of increase observed in the European region and the United States of America. The epidemiology differs from country to country depending not only on the disease, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures."
5214,Clinical significance of the serum IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus disease-2019.,"Objective: To explore the clinical value of serum IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. Methods: 105 COVID-19 patients were enrolled as the disease group. 197 non-COVID-19 patients served as the control group. Magnetic chemiluminescent immunoassay (MCLIA) was used to detect the IgM and IgG. Results: The peak of positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgM was about 1 week earlier than that of IgG. It reached to peak within 15-21 days and then began a slowly decline. The positive rates of IgG were increased with the disease course and reached the peak between 22 and 39 days. The differences in sensitivity of the three detection modes (IgM, IgG, and IgM + IgG) were statistically significant. The largest group of test cases (illness onset 15-21 days) showed that the positive rate of IgG was higher than IgM. Also, the sensitivity of IgM combined with IgG was higher than IgM or IgG. IgM and IgG were monitored dynamically for 16 patients with COVID-19, the results showed that serological transformation of IgM was carried out simultaneously with IgG in seven patients, which was earlier than IgG in four patients and later than IgG in five patients. Conclusion: The detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG is very important to determine the course of COVID-19. Nucleic acid detection combined with serum antibody of SARS-CoV-2 may be the best laboratory indicator for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the phrase and predication for prognosis of COVID-19."

5216,Clinical Outcomes Of A COVID-19 Vaccine: Implementation Over Efficacy.,"The global effort to develop a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is on track to produce one or more authorized vaccines. We examine how different definitions and thresholds of vaccine efficacy, coupled with different levels of implementation effectiveness and background epidemic severity, translate into outcomes including cumulative infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Using a mathematical simulation of vaccination, we find that factors related to implementation will contribute more to the success of vaccination programs than a vaccine's efficacy as determined in clinical trials. The benefits of a vaccine will decline substantially in the event of manufacturing or deployment delays, significant vaccine hesitancy, or greater epidemic severity. Our findings demonstrate the urgent need for health officials to invest greater financial resources and attention to vaccine production and distribution programs, to redouble efforts to promote public confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, and to encourage continued adherence to other mitigation approaches, even after a vaccine becomes available."
5217,Duodenal perforation in a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient with negative PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in the peritoneal fluid.,"Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected health care organizations globally. Many aspects of this disease, as well as the risks for patients treated with multiple drug regimens to control severe COVID-19, are unclear. During emergency surgery for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission to the surgical staff has yet to be determined. Patients and methods: In this report, we describe a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient with severe respiratory syndrome treated with multiple doses of IL-6 inhibitors who presented with a perforated duodenal ulcer and underwent emergency surgery. During and after surgery, we tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the ulcer site and in the peritoneal fluid. Results: The history of the patient allows for two possible interpretations of the pathogenesis of the duodenal ulcer, which could have been a stress ulcer, or a gastrointestinal ulcer associated to the use of IL-6 inhibitors. We also noticed that the ulcer site and peritoneal fluid repeatedly tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reviewed the pertinent literature on gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19 and on SARS-CoV-2 detection in the peritoneal fluid of surgical patients and discussed possible prevention strategies for bleeding and the actual risk of infection for the surgical staff. Conclusions: The first implication of this case is that the relation between repeated administration of IL-6 inhibitors and upper gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation must be investigated, and that the threshold for administering prophylactic proton pump inhibitors therapy should be carefully considered for patients with severe COVID-19. The second implication is that further testing should be performed on the peritoneal fluid of COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency surgical procedures to clarify the discordant results for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the peritoneal cavity and the possible risk of transmission to the surgical staff."

5219,Early postoperative outcomes among patients with delayed surgeries after preoperative positive test for SARS-CoV-2: A case-control study from a single institution.,"Background: There are limited data on surgical complications for patients that have delayed surgery after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to analyze the surgical outcomes of patients submitted to surgery after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Asymptomatic patients that had surgery delayed after preoperative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were matched in a 1:2 ratio for age, type of surgery and American Society of Anesthesiologists to patients with negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results: About 1253 patients underwent surgical procedures and were subjected to screening for SARS-CoV-2. Forty-nine cases with a delayed surgery were included in the coronavirus disease (COVID) recovery (COVID-rec) group and were matched to 98 patients included in the COVID negative (COVID-neg) group. Overall, 22 (15%) patients had 30-days postoperative complications, but there was no statistically difference between groups -16.3% for COVID-rec and 14.3% for COVID-neg, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 1.17:95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-3.0; p = .74). Moreover, we did not find difference regarding grades more than or equal to 3 complication rates - 8.2% for COVID-rec and 6.1% for COVID-neg (OR 1.36:95%CI 0.36-5.0; p = .64). There were no pulmonary complications or SARS-CoV-2 related infection and no deaths within the 30-days after surgery. Conclusions: Our study suggests that patients with delayed elective surgeries due to asymptomatic preoperative positive SARS-CoV-2 test are not at higher risk of postoperative complications."
