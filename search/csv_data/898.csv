8970,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Vertical Transmission from an Asymptomatic Mother.,"In utero transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is a point of debate. We report a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vertical transmission from asymptomatic mother, with molecular detection in mother's blood at delivery and neonatal nasopharyngeal swabs at 5 and 28 hours of life and later IgG seroconversion. The newborn was asymptomatic."
8971,Promising inhibitors of main protease of novel corona virus to prevent the spread of COVID-19 using docking and molecular dynamics simulation.,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency and the matter of serious concern, which has been declared a pandemic by WHO. Till date, no potential medicine/ drug is available to cure the infected persons from SARS-CoV-2. This deadly virus is named as novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus and caused coronavirus disease, that is, COVID-19. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human was confirmed in the Wuhan city of the China. COVID-19 is an infectious disease and spread from man to man as well as surface to man . In the present work, in silico approach was followed to find potential molecule to control this infection. Authors have screened more than one million molecules available in the ZINC database and taken the best two compounds based on binding energy score. These lead molecules were further studied through docking against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Then, molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease with and without screened compounds were performed at room temperature to determine the thermodynamic parameters to understand the inhibition. Further, molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures were performed to understand the efficiency of the inhibition of the main protease in the presence of the screened compounds. Change in energy for the formation of the complexes between the main protease of novel coronavirus and ZINC20601870 as well ZINC00793735 at room temperature was determined on applying MM-GBSA calculations. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed their antiviral potential and may inhibit viral replication experimentally. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
8972,Patients with COVID-19 who experience a myocardial infarction have complex coronary morphology and high in-hospital mortality: Primary results of a nationwide angiographic study.,"Objectives: We aimed to explore angiographic patterns and in-hospital outcomes of patients with concomitant coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and myocardial infarction (MI). Background: Patients with COVID-19 may experience MI during the course of the viral infection. However, this association is currently poorly understood. Methods: This is a multicenter prospective study of consecutive patients with concomitant COVID-19 and MI who underwent coronary angiography. Quantitative and qualitative coronary angiography were analyzed by two observers in an independent core lab. Results: A total of 152 patients were included, of whom 142 (93.4%) had COVID-19 diagnosis confirmation. The median time between symptom onset and hospital admission was 5 (1-10) days. A total of 83 (54.6%) patients presented with ST-elevation MI. The median angiographic Syntax score was 16 (9.0-25.3) and 69.0% had multi-vessel disease. At least one complex lesion was found in 73.0% of patients, 51.3% had a thrombus containing lesion, and 57.9% had myocardial blush grades 0/1. The overall in-hospital mortality was 23.7%. ST-segment elevation MI presentation and baseline myocardial blush grades 0 or 1 were independently associated with a higher risk of death (HR 2.75, 95%CI 1.30-5.80 and HR 3.73, 95%CI 1.61-8.61, respectively). Conclusions: Patients who have a MI in the context of ongoing COVID-19 mostly present complex coronary morphologies, implying a background of prior atherosclerotic disease superimposed on a thrombotic milieu. The in-hospital prognosis is poor with a markedly high mortality, prompting further investigation to better clarify this newly described condition."
8973,"Assessing Community Vulnerability over 3 Waves of COVID-19 Pandemic, Hong Kong, China.","We constructed a coronavirus disease community vulnerability index using micro district-level socioeconomic and demographic data and analyzed its correlations with case counts across the 3 pandemic waves in Hong Kong, China. We found that districts with greater vulnerability reported more cases in the third wave when widespread community outbreaks occurred."
8974,COVID-19: review of case reports.,"Recently published case reports relating to anesthesia in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were reviewed. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by positive results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Numerous reports handled emergency cesarean delivery. Primary symptoms and laboratory data of pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant patients. Although the mortality rate is reported to be high after surgery in patients with COVID-19, cesarean delivery was successfully performed under regional anesthesia in most cases and postoperative course was favorable both in the parents and newborns. There is no direct evidence of vertical mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in a newborn two hours after delivery from a pregnant woman with COVID-19, based on the increased immunoglobulin levels and deranged liver function, suggesting that its possibility cannot be completely eliminated. Emergency cerebral shunt reconstruction was performed repeatedly in an eight-month-old boy with COVID-19. The tracheal tube was removed in the operating room after surgery and postoperative course was uneventful. All the procedures should be performed in isolated operating rooms with medical staff with level-3 personal protection to ensure the safety of patients and health care providers."
8975,Chimeric spike mRNA vaccines protect against Sarbecovirus challenge in mice.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 highlights the need to develop universal vaccination strategies against the broader Sarbecovirus subgenus. Using chimeric spike designs, we demonstrate protection against challenge from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351, bat CoV (Bt-CoV) RsSHC014, and a heterologous Bt-CoV WIV-1 in vulnerable aged mice. Chimeric spike messenger RNAs (mRNAs) induced high levels of broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against high-risk Sarbecoviruses. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination not only showed a marked reduction in neutralizing titers against heterologous Sarbecoviruses, but SARS-CoV and WIV-1 challenge in mice resulted in breakthrough infections. Chimeric spike mRNA vaccines efficiently neutralized D614G, mink cluster five, and the UK B.1.1.7 and South African B.1.351 variants of concern. Thus, multiplexed-chimeric spikes can prevent SARS-like zoonotic coronavirus infections with pandemic potential."
8976,COVID-19 surveillance in Southeastern Virginia using wastewater-based epidemiology.,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been used to analyze markers in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent to characterize emerging chemicals, drug use patterns, or disease spread within communities. This approach can be particularly helpful in understanding outbreaks of disease like the novel Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) when combined with clinical datasets. In this study, three RT-ddPCR assays (N1, N2, N3) were used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in weekly samples from nine WWTPs in southeastern Virginia. In the first several weeks of sampling, SARS-CoV-2 detections were sporadic. Frequency of detections and overall concentrations of RNA within samples increased from mid March into late July. During the twenty-one week study, SARS-CoV-2 concentrations ranged from 101 to 104 copies 100 mL-1 in samples where viral RNA was detected. Fluctuations in population normalized loading rates in several of the WWTP service areas agreed with known outbreaks during the study. Here we propose several ways that data can be presented spatially and temporally to be of greatest use to public health officials. As the COVID-19 pandemic wanes, it is likely that communities will see increased incidence of small, localized outbreaks. In these instances, WBE could be used as a pre-screening tool to better target clinical testing needs in communities with limited resources."
8977,The Neurological Manifestations of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Purpose of review: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global health challenge. This review aims to summarize the incidence, risk factors, possible pathophysiology, and proposed management of neurological manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or neuro-PASC based on the published literature. Recent findings: The National Institutes of Health has noted that PASC is a multi-organ disorder ranging from mild symptoms to an incapacitating state that can last for weeks or longer following recovery from initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed as the culprit for the development of PASC. These include, but are not limited to, direct or indirect invasion of the virus into the brain, immune dysregulation, hormonal disturbances, elevated cytokine levels due to immune reaction leading to chronic inflammation, direct tissue damage to other organs, and persistent low-grade infection. A multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of neuro-PASC will be required to diagnose and address these symptoms. Tailored rehabilitation and novel cognitive therapy protocols are as important as pharmacological treatments to treat neuro-PASC effectively. With recognizing the growing numbers of COVID-19 patients suffering from neuro-PASC, there is an urgent need to identify affected individuals early to provide the most appropriate and efficient treatments. Awareness among the general population and health care professionals about PASC is rising, and more efforts are needed to understand and treat this new emerging challenge. In this review, we summarize the relevant scientific literature about neuro-PASC."
8978,Effectiveness of Physical Distancing: Staying 6 Feet Over to Put Respiratory Viruses 6 Feet Under.,"Community transmission of severe acute respiratory illness Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Arizona was noted in March 2020. It was our hypothesis that the associated implementation of physical distancing and masking led to a decline in circulation and detection of common respiratory viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs processed with the Biofire, Film Array respiratory panel at Mayo Clinic Arizona were reviewed from January 1, 2017, to July 31, 2020. A total of 13,324 nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed. Between April and July 2017- 2019 (Period A) a mean of 262 tests were performed monthly, falling to 128 for the corresponding months of 2020 (Period B). A reduction in the monthly mean number of positive tests (Period A 71.5; Period B 2.8) and mean positivity rate (Period A 25.04%; Period B 2.07%) was observed. Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most prevalent virus, with a monthly mean of 21.6 cases (30.2% of positives) for Period A and 2 cases (72.7% of positives) for Period B. Positivity for a second virus occurred in a mean of 2.1 positive tests (3.3%) in Period A but was absent in Period B. Implementation of distancing and masking coincides with a marked reduction in respiratory virus detection and likely circulation. Data from the fall/winter of 2020 will help clarify the potential role for distancing and masking as a mitigation strategy, not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also in the seasonal battle against common respiratory viruses."
8979,Development and application of therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19.,"The pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a global health crisis. Fundamental studies at genome, transcriptome, proteome, and interactome levels have revealed many viral and host targets for therapeutic interventions. Hundreds of antibodies for treating COVID-19 have been developed at preclinical and clinical stages in the format of polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, and cocktail antibodies. Four products, i.e., convalescent plasma, bamlanivimab, REGN-Cov2, and the cocktail of bamlanivimab and etesevimab have been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use. Hundreds of relevant clinical trials are ongoing worldwide. Therapeutic antibody therapies have been a very active and crucial part of COVID-19 treatment. In this review, we focus on the progress of therapeutic COVID-19 antibody development and application, discuss corresponding problems and challenges, suggesting new strategies and solutions."
