2300,Evidence and speculations: vaccines and therapeutic options for COVID-19 pandemic.,"A novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) emerged in China, at the end of December 2019 which posed an International Public Health Emergency, and later declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named it SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), while the disease was named COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease- 2019). Many questions related to the exact mode of transmission, animal origins, and antiviral therapeutics are not clear yet. Nevertheless, it is required to urgently launch a new protocol to evaluate the side effects of unapproved vaccines and antiviral therapeutics to accelerate the clinical application of new drugs. In this review, we highlight the most salient characteristics and recent findings of COVID-19 disease, molecular virology, interspecies mechanisms, and health consequences related to this disease."
2301,Successful return to professional men's football (soccer) competition after the COVID-19 shutdown: a cohort study in the German Bundesliga.,"Objectives: To evaluate the restart of the German Bundesliga (football (soccer)) during the COVID-19 pandemic from a medical perspective. Methods: Participants were male professional football players from the two highest German leagues and the officials working closely with them. Our report covers nine match days spread over 9 weeks (May to July 2020). Daily symptom monitoring, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA twice weekly, and antibody tests (on two occasions-early during the phase in May 2020 and in the week of the last match) were conducted. Target variables were: (1) onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms, (2) positive PCR results, and (3) IgG seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. All detected seroconversions were controlled by neutralisation tests. Findings: Suspicious symptoms were reported for one player; an immediate additional PCR test as well as all subsequent diagnostic and antibody tests proved negative for coronavirus. Of 1702 regularly tested individuals (1079 players, 623 officials members), 8 players and 4 officials tested positive during one of the first rounds of PCR testing prior to the onset of team training, 2 players during the third round. No further positive results occurred during the remainder of the season. 694 players and 291 officials provided two serum samples for antibody testing. Nine players converted from negative/borderline to positive (without symptoms); two players who initially tested positive tested negative at the end of the season. 22 players remained seropositive throughout the season. None of the seroconversions was confirmed in the neutralisation test. Conclusion: Professional football training and matches can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires strict hygiene measures including regular PCR testing."
2302,Comparison of six commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays-Choice of assay depends on intended use.,"Objectives: Evaluate six commercial serological assays for detection of IgA, IgM or IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different disease severities. Methods: Three lateral flow tests (LFTs) (Acro IgM/IgG, CTK IgM/IgG, Livzon IgM/IgG) and three ELISA assays (Euroimmun IgA and IgG, Wantai IgM) were included. Application was evaluated using samples from 57 patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, stratified according to disease severity. Specificity was assessed using historical samples from 200 blood donors. Results: While IgM LFTs failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 37-84% of non-hospitalised patients, the Wantai IgM ELISA detected antibodies in 79%. The Euroimmun IgG ELISA detected antibodies in 95% of non-hospitalised patients. IgA, IgM and IgG ELISA levels were initially low, increased over time, and correlated with disease severity. LFT sensitivity declined in samples taken >28 days after symptom onset/resolution. The Livzon IgG LFT had the highest specificity (98.5%), followed by the Euroimmun IgG ELISA (96.2%). The specificity for Euroimmun IgA ELISA improved (â‰¥97.5%) using a custom cut-off value (4.0). Conclusions: The sensitive and semi-quantitative ELISA assays are most appropriate for serologic detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mild cases. Livzon LFT and Euroimmun ELISA had the highest specificity among the IgG assays, making them most suitable for seroprevalence studies."

2304,[Attitude of health care workers towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination].,"Objectives: Attitude of health care workers (HCW), namely registered nurses, towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and compulsory vaccination. Method: In a structured anonymous scientific survey from January 29 to April 26, 2021 a questionnaire was sent to 72 heads of orthopedic and trauma departments. The doctors were asked to distribute and recollect the questionnaire after obtaining informed consent from the hospital administration, the nursing management and the works council. Descriptive statistics were used to explain the results. Results: 355 answers from 5 departments were evaluated. In 65 out of 72 hospitals the top managers of either hospital or nursing administration or the works council declined participation, 2 heads of department were not interested. 50,7% of HCW were already vaccinated or had a scheduled appointment for vaccination, 14,9% had not yet made up their mind and 34,4% refuse vaccination. The majority of HCW vote against compulsory vaccination (47,6%), less than a quarter approves it (23,4%). Conclusion: The willingness to vaccinate was extremely low in this survey. The main reason for refusal to vaccinate is fear of side effects, so an information campaign should primarily focus on this topic."

2306,"COVID-19 in Amazonas, Brazil, was driven by the persistence of endemic lineages and P.1 emergence.","The northern state of Amazonas is among the regions in Brazil most heavily affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and has experienced two exponentially growing waves, in early and late 2020. Through a genomic epidemiology study based on 250 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from different Amazonas municipalities sampled between March 2020 and January 2021, we reveal that the first exponential growth phase was driven mostly by the dissemination of lineage B.1.195, which was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28 between May and June 2020. The second wave coincides with the emergence of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1, which evolved from a local B.1.1.28 clade in late November 2020 and replaced the parental lineage in <2 months. Our findings support the conclusion that successive lineage replacements in Amazonas were driven by a complex combination of variable levels of social distancing measures and the emergence of a more transmissible VOC P.1 virus. These data provide insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 epidemic waves and the risk of dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 VOC P.1 in Brazil and, potentially, worldwide."
2307,Home Sample Self-Collection for COVID-19 Patients.,"Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using specimens collected from nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs is the standard screening approach for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While PCR is rapid and highly accurate, it requires costly laboratory equipment and healthcare professionals that limit its use for large-scale screening of mild or asymptomatic patients. Self-collection kits for use in the home could remedy this and have consequently received great attention. In April, 2020, a self-collection kit from LapCorp was the first such kit to be approved by the FDA. In the following month, May 2020, another kit developed by Everlywell received FDA approval, and more kits are evidently on their way to the market in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Because these home-based, self-collection kits are easy to use and may be more acceptable for patients, they provide a superior screening option for mild or asymptomatic patients under self-quarantine. These kits conserve personal protective equipment and healthcare manpower already in short supply. The primary issues affecting the efficacy of this approach are the potential for inappropriate sampling and insufficient clinical examination. A detailed review of the commercially available kits currently available is provided and their prospective impact is noted during the current pandemic."
2308,An electrochemical SARS-CoV-2 biosensor inspired by glucose test strip manufacturing processes.,"Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests are critical to reducing the impact of SARS-CoV-2. This study presents early, but promising measurements of SARS-CoV-2 using the ACE2 enzyme as the recognition element to achieve clinically relevant detection. The test provides a scalable route to sensitive, specific, rapid and low cost mass testing."
2309,"Evaluation of High-Throughput SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assays in a Longitudinal Cohort of Patients with Mild COVID-19: Clinical Sensitivity, Specificity, and Association with Virus Neutralization Test.","Background: The association between SARS-CoV-2 commercial serological assays and virus neutralization test (VNT) has been poorly explored in mild patients with COVID-19. Methods: 439 serum specimens were longitudinally collected from 76 healthcare workers with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. The clinical sensitivity (determined weekly) of 9 commercial serological assays were evaluated. Clinical specificity was assessed using 69 pre-pandemic sera. Correlation, agreement, and concordance with the VNT were also assessed on a subset of 170 samples. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was estimated at 2 neutralizing antibody titers. Results: The Wantai Total Ab assay targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S protein presented the best sensitivity at different times during the course of disease. The clinical specificity was greater than 95% for all tests except for the Euroimmun IgA assay. The overall agreement with the presence of neutralizing antibodies ranged from 62.2% (95%CI; 56.0-68.1) for bioMÃ©rieux IgM to 91.2% (87.0-94.2) for Siemens. The lowest negative percent agreement (NPA) was found with the Wantai Total Ab assay (NPA 33% (21.1-48.3)). The NPA for other total Ab or IgG assays targeting the S or the RBD was 80.7% (66.7-89.7), 90.3% (78.1-96.1), and 96.8% (86.8-99.3) for Siemens, bioMÃ©rieux IgG, and DiaSorin, respectively. None of the commercial assays have sufficient performance to detect a neutralizing titer of 80 (AUC < 0.76). Conclusions: Although some assays show a better agreement with VNT than others, the present findings emphasize that commercialized serological tests, including those targeting the RBD, cannot substitute a VNT for the assessment of functional antibody response."
