4620,Model-informed COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies by age and serostatus.,"Limited initial supply of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine raises the question of how to prioritize available doses. We used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies. A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults greater than 60 years old. Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact. Although maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts."
4621,Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcome in patients with solid tumors or hematological malignancies: a single-center study.,"Background: Immunocompromised cancer patients are presumed to be at high risk of developing COVID-19 infection. Predisposing factors to contracting COVID-19 and to severe outcomes have been described in registries but were not compared between solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Method: This retrospective single oncologic center study included adults with solid tumors or hematological malignancies referred to testing by naso-pharyngeal swab for a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from March 10 to May 18, 2020. Results: A total of 212 patients were included in the study. Forty-five (21%) were tested positive with SARS-CoV-2. The univariate analysis with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR as a dependent variable reveals significant odds ratios (ORs) for age-with a mean of 62.5 years-(OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.08), performance status â‰¥2 (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.22-4.70), inpatient status (OR: 2.36, 95%CI: 1.11-4.91), and hematological malignancies (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.23-4.96). In contrast, OR for solid tumors reveals a negative association (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.20-0.81). When integrating severe outcome (ICU admission or COVID-19-related death) as a dependent variable, the univariate logistic regression model shows significant ORs for pre-existing lymphopenia (OR: 4.0, 95% CI: 1.17-15.04), hematological malignancies (OR: 3.73, 95% CI: 1.09-13.80), and a negative association for solid tumors (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.07-0.92). Conclusion: In patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hematological malignancies were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes. Other factors were age and inpatient status."
4622,[Three cases of COVID-19 in elderly patients with delayed release from isolation due to persistent positive polymerase chain reaction findings].,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has spread worldwide, with no sign of its control in Japan yet. Eight elderly COVID-19 patients over 90 years of age were treated at our hospital. We herein report three cases with characteristic progression. Case 1 was a 91-year-old female patient diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia previously who did not show improvement with medication; thus, she was transferred to our hospital 16 days after the onset. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 using the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Favipiravir, methylprednisolone, and unfractionated heparin were administered, but she only tested negative 68 days after the onset, at which point she was discharged. However, she was transferred back to our hospital 80 days after the onset since she tested positive again. She was transferred to another hospital 110 days after the onset without testing negative. Case 2 was a 102-year-old female. Despite being a mild case, it took 32 days to obtain negative PCR findings, leading to a decline in the activities of daily living. Case 3 was a 90-year-old male patient treated with favipiravir, dexamethasone, and unfractionated heparin, but his condition deteriorated. He never tested negative for PCR and ultimately died 20 days after the onset. Reports suggest that PCR positivity does not necessarily indicate infectivity, but there are no clear criteria for lifting a quarantine. Therefore, PCR negativity is often sought for ""peace of mind."" In the current situation where hospitals are fully occupied, clear criteria for lifting the quarantine should be promptly determined. After the completion of treatment, it is more important to monitor symptoms and take standard precautions, such as daily health monitoring, wearing a mask, and keeping an appropriate distance from others, than to obtain a negative PCR result."
4623,"A comprehensive antigen production and characterisation study for easy-to-implement, specific and quantitative SARS-CoV-2 serotests.","Background: Antibody tests are essential tools to investigate humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. While first-generation antibody tests have primarily provided qualitative results, accurate seroprevalence studies and tracking of antibody levels over time require highly specific, sensitive and quantitative test setups. Methods: We have developed two quantitative, easy-to-implement SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, based on the spike receptor binding domain and the nucleocapsid protein. Comprehensive evaluation of antigens from several biotechnological platforms enabled the identification of superior antigen designs for reliable serodiagnostic. Cut-off modelling based on unprecedented large and heterogeneous multicentric validation cohorts allowed us to define optimal thresholds for the tests' broad applications in different aspects of clinical use, such as seroprevalence studies and convalescent plasma donor qualification. Findings: Both developed serotests individually performed similarly-well as fully-automated CE-marked test systems. Our described sensitivity-improved orthogonal test approach assures highest specificity (99.8%); thereby enabling robust serodiagnosis in low-prevalence settings with simple test formats. The inclusion of a calibrator permits accurate quantitative monitoring of antibody concentrations in samples collected at different time points during the acute and convalescent phase of COVID-19 and disclosed antibody level thresholds that correlate well with robust neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Interpretation: We demonstrate that antigen source and purity strongly impact serotest performance. Comprehensive biotechnology-assisted selection of antigens and in-depth characterisation of the assays allowed us to overcome limitations of simple ELISA-based antibody test formats based on chromometric reporters, to yield comparable assay performance as fully-automated platforms.

4627,Characteristics and Unexpected COVID-19 Diagnoses in Resuscitation Room Patients during the COVID-19 Outbreak-A Retrospective Case Series.,"Introduction: Emergency department (ED) triage regarding infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is challenging. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Germany, the diagnostic outcomes of critically ill patients admitted to the resuscitation room in the ED of our academic 754-bed hospital should be analyzed. Methods: All resuscitation room patients between March 1st and April 15th 2020 were included in this retrospective study. Every patient with suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a pharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR), divided in the clinical subgroups of ""highly suspicious for COVID-19"" and ""COVID-19 as differential diagnosis."" All respiratory and infectious symptoms were included as at least ""differential diagnosis"" as an expanded suspicion strategy. Results: Ninety-five patients were included (trauma n = 14, critically ill n = 81). Of 3 highly suspicious patients, 2 had rt-PCR positive pharyngeal swabs. In 39 patients, COVID-19 was defined as differential diagnosis, and 3 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of them, pharyngeal swabs were positive in 1 case, while in 2 cases, only tracheal fluid was rt-PCR positive while the pharyngeal swabs were negative. In one of these 2 cases, chest computed tomography (CT) was also negative for ground-glass opacities but showed a pulmonary abscess and pulmonary embolism. Conclusion: We recommend an expanded suspicion strategy for COVID-19 due to unexpected diagnostic outcomes. Personal protective equipment should be used in every resuscitation room operation due to unexpected cases and initial knowledge gaps. Furthermore, tracheal fluid should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 in every intubated patient due to cases with negative pharyngeal swabs and negative chest CT."
4628,Factors associated with reported likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 in a nationally representative US survey.,"Objectives: Although general principles related to vaccination hesitancy have been well researched, reports on reluctance to be vaccinated for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States are somewhat surprising, given the disease's substantive disruption of everyday life. However, the landscape in which people are making COVID-19 vaccination decisions has recently evolved with releases of encouraging vaccine-related data and changes to official messaging about the virus. Therefore, this study sought to identify factors associated with reported likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 among US adults in late January 2021. Study design: We used the Prolific online research panel to survey a nationally representative sample of 1017 US adults. Methods: Respondents were asked about their behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccination, trust in science, perceptions related to COVID-19, and selected sociodemographic factors. We computed associations between those 11 independent variables and likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 using multiple linear regression. Results: Around 73.9% of respondents indicated at least some likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Trust in science and perceived seriousness of COVID-19 were positively associated with intention to get vaccinated, and identifying as Black or African American was negatively associated with intention to get vaccinated. Other factors were moderately, weakly, or not at all associated with intention. Conclusions: Building trust in science and truthfully emphasizing the seriousness of catching COVID-19 should be further researched for their potential to support campaigns to encourage COVID-19 vaccination. Data continue to suggest the importance of dialogue with Black communities about COVID-19 vaccination."
