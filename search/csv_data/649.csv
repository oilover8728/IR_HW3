6480,Serial Screening for COVID-19 in Asymptomatic Patients Receiving Anticancer Therapy in the United Arab Emirates.,This cohort study examines the implementation of a microbiologic screening pilot program in Al Zahra Hospital in the United Arab Emirates for identifying presymptomatic COVID-19 in patients with cancer.
6481,Validation of SARS-CoV-2 detection across multiple specimen types.,"Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused considerable disruption across the world, resulting in more than 235,000 deaths since December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has a wide tropism and detection of the virus has been described in multiple specimen types, including various respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool. Objective: To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of a laboratory modified CDCbased SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 assay across a range of sample types. Study Design We compared the matrix effect on the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by qRT-PCR in nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool, VTM, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene. Results: LoDs were established using a modified CDC-based laboratory developed test and ranged from a mean CT cut-off of 33.8-35.7 (10-20 copies/reaction) for the N1 gene target, and 34.0-36.2 (1-10 copies/reaction) for N2. Alternatives to VTM such as PBS and HBSS had comparable LoDs. The N2 gene target was found to be most sensitive in CSF. Conclusion: A modified CDC-based laboratory developed test is able to detect SARSCoV- 2 accurately with similar sensitivity across all sample types tested."
6482,Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia: what we know and do not know.,"The development of vaccines to fight COVID-19 has been a remarkable medical achievement. However, this global immunization effort has been complicated by a rare vaccine-related outcome characterized by thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in association with platelet-activating anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies. In this Spotlight, we will discuss the recently described complication of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) occurring in response to certain COVID-19 vaccines. Although information about this clinical condition is rapidly evolving, we will summarize our current understanding of VITT."
6483,"Effects of adjusting public health, travel, and social measures during the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination: a modelling study.","Background: Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, various public health and social measures (PHSMs) have been used to suppress and mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. With mass vaccination programmes against COVID-19 being rolled out in many countries in early 2021, we aimed to evaluate to what extent travel restrictions and other PHSMs can be relaxed without exacerbating the local and global spread of COVID-19. Methods: We adapted an existing age-structured susceptible-infectious-removed model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics that can be parameterised with country-specific age demographics and contact patterns to simulate the effect of vaccination and PHSM relaxation on transmission. We varied assumptions by age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness, vaccine uptake, contact patterns, and age structures. We used Hong Kong as a case study and assumed that, before vaccination, the population is completely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We applied our model to 304 jurisdictions (27 countries and 277 sub-national administrative regions from eight countries). We assumed that PHSMs have suppressed the effective reproductive number (Re) to fall between 1·0 and 9·0 locally before the commencement of vaccination programmes. We evaluated the levels of PHSMs that should be maintained during the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination to avoid a large local outbreak of COVID-19, with different assumptions about vaccine efficacy, vaccination coverage, and travel restrictions. We assumed that the maximum capacity of the health system, in terms of daily hospital admissions, is 0·005% of the population size. Findings: At vaccine efficacy of 0·80 in reducing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 0·50 in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, and 0·95 in reducing symptomatic COVID-19 diseases, vaccination coverage would have to be 100% for all individuals aged 30 or older to avoid an outbreak, when relaxing PHSMs, that would overload the local health-care system, assuming a pre-vaccination Re of 2·5. Testing and quarantine of at least 5 days would have to be maintained for inbound travellers to minimise the risk of reintroducing a local outbreak until high vaccination coverages are attained locally and overseas in most countries. Interpretation: Gradual relaxation of PHSMs should be carefully planned during the roll-out of vaccination programmes, and easing of travel restrictions weighed against risk of reintroducing outbreaks, to avoid overwhelming health systems and minimise deaths related to COVID-19.

6484,COVID-19 Australia: Epidemiology Report 37- Reporting period ending 14 March 2021.,
6485,[A patient with severe COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma].,"Background: COVID-19 can lead to life-threatening disease. While awaiting vaccines or documented specific therapeutic agents, several alternative treatment options are under investigation. This is a case report of the first COVID-19 patient treated with convalescent plasma in Norway. Case presentation: A patient with severe COVID-19 on prolonged mechanical ventilation, who was PCR SARS-Cov-2 positive on day 22, was transfused with convalescent plasma on day 31 and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the following day. The patient gradually improved and was weaned from the ventilator and discharged alive from the ICU on day 63. Interpretation: This case report concerns one patient with clinical improvement after convalescent plasma transfusion. A SARS-CoV-2 test was not performed immediately before transfusion and the complexity of intensive care treatment makes it difficult to draw any conclusions on the potential effectiveness of this treatment. However, this case report is encouraging with regard to planned trials with convalescent plasma."
6486,COVID-19 Vaccination-Associated Lymphadenopathy on FDG PET/CT: Distinctive Features in Adenovirus-Vectored Vaccine.,"Purpose: This study investigated 18F-FDG PET/CT features of adenovirus-vectored vaccination against COVID-19 in healthy subjects. Patients and methods: Thirty-one health care workers had been vaccinated Vaxzevria and underwent FDG PET/CT as an optional test for a cancer screening program. Size and FDG uptake of the hypermetabolic lymph nodes were measured. Uptake value of spleen was also measured with liver for comparison. Results: All examinees who underwent FDG PET/CT within 14 days' interval showed hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies ipsilateral to vaccine injection. All examinees with hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy had simultaneous muscular uptakes until 23 days' interval. Among 12 examinees who underwent FDG PET/CT more than 15 days after vaccination, only 3 male examinees did not show hypermetabolism in the axillary lymph nodes. There was no female examinee with negative hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy until 29 days after vaccination. Conclusions: Hypermetabolic reactive lymphadenopathy in the ipsilateral axillary area with or without supraclavicular area is most likely to occur in a healthy person with recent adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccination on FDG PET/CT."
