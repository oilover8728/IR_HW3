2820,[COVID-19 et flu: vaccination intent among health professionals].,"The infection protection and control team and occupational health service come together every year to promote the flu vaccine among health professionals. In 2020, the risk of the co-circulation of the flu virus and SARS-CoV-2 strengthened their case. During the last trimester, we surveyed health professionals to find out their intention with regard to the flu and covid-19 vaccines: 42% said they wanted to be vaccinated against the flu, but only 23% were willing to have the covid-19 vaccine."
2821,"The effect of lockdown regulations on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Gauteng Province, South Africa.","Background: On 26 March 2020, the South African (SA) government initiated a 21-day national level 5 lockdown which was subsequently eased off and downgraded to level 4 on 1 May and to level 3 on 1 June. The effect of lockdown measures on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is currently uncertain. In this article, we analyse the effects of the lockdown measures on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in one of the epicentres in SA. Objectives: To measure the effects of lockdown measures introduced in SA on SARS-CoV-2 attack rates (ARs, the percentage of individuals who tested positive in a specified time period) in Gauteng Province during a 4-month period (March - June 2020). Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we used a comprehensive database from an independent pathology laboratory in Gauteng. We analysed trends of positivity rates of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests done during the 4-month period. The ARs are reported over time (unweighted and age-weighted 14-day moving averages) by age groups, gender, and different regions/districts in Gauteng. Results: A total of 162 528 tests were performed at a private laboratory between 5 March and 30 June 2020, of which 20 574 were positive (overall AR 12.7%). These positive tests constituted 44.8% of all positive cases in the province (20 574/45 944). Sixty-two percent of all tests were done in June during lockdown level 3. There was an exponential increase in the AR in June (18.3%) when lockdown was eased to level 3, in comparison with 4.2% (March), 2.2% (April) and 3.3% (May). The increase in June was seen in all the age groups, although it was more pronounced in the 21 - 60 years age groups than the younger (0 - 20 years) and older (&gt;60 years) age groups. The AR was significantly higher in males (13.2%) compared with females (12.1%) (Ï‡2 test, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: The findings of this study testify to the rapid increase in ARs resulting from easing of the lockdown regulations, especially to level 3 in June. Of concern is the upward trend in the AR across all age groups, especially &lt;20 years (15.9%), which was not reported in other parts of the world. Population age dynamics should therefore be considered when taking future decisions about lockdown regulations."

Here, we compare 11 different RT-PCR test systems used in seven diagnostic laboratories in Germany in March 2020. While most assays performed well, we identified detection problems in a commonly used assay that may have resulted in false-negative test results during the first weeks of the pandemic."

2825,[Expert recommendation for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in patients with HIV infection].,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is currently being actively promoted all over the world, which would serve a promising measure to combat the epidemic. HIV-infected patients manifest varying degrees of immunodeficiency and chronic inflammation, who may require a special consideration on vaccine types and timing of immunization depending on specific clinical situations. The present recommendation provides reference for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in HIV-infected patients."
2826,Measuring Progress of Regulatory Convergence and Cooperation Among Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Member Economies in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Purpose: Regulatory convergence and cooperation among medical product regulatory authorities are essential to delivering safe and efficacious products quickly to patients. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need for streamlined regulatory approval processes-which can be achieved in part through regulatory convergence and cooperation-both to accelerate availability of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics and to maintain the availability of the existing medical products unrelated to COVID-19. Methods: The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Life Sciences Innovation Forum (LSIF) established the Regulatory Harmonization Steering Committee (RHSC) in 2008 to advance regulatory convergence among APEC's 21 member economies. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed in 2018 to measure convergence. Results: This paper reports survey results collected from KPI tracking in March 2020 from medical product regulatory authorities in all 21 APEC economies concerning areas of regulatory practice in which they could converge and cooperate. For example, from 2008 to 2020, there was a 14.3% increase in the number of APEC member economy regulatory authorities sharing Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Certificates and a 28% increase in the number of regulatory authorities accepting multisite licenses in that same period. In addition, this paper explores how APEC economies could realize a maximum level of regulatory convergence and cooperation. Conclusions: Convergence efforts within APEC can accelerate availability of medical products including that related to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics, while maintaining the availability of the existing medical products unrelated to COVID-19 vaccines and treatment. New KPIs and capability building are to be considered to enable a new era of innovation ushered in by COVID-19."
2827,Shaping public opinion through the lens of agenda setting in rolling out COVID-19 vaccination program.,The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination hesitancy is a concern that the world faces. The government and private sectors are initiating measures to address this problem. Media plays a crucial role in information and extensive dissemination. This paper highlights the role of the agenda setting platform in shaping public opinion on COVID-19 vaccination program. Massive information dissemination through media can be an effective tool in educating the public regarding the efficacy of anti-COVID 19 vaccines both for self-preservation and promotion of the common good.
2828,National interest may require distributing COVID-19 vaccines to other countries.,"As immunization campaigns are accelerating, understanding how to distribute the scarce doses of vaccines is of paramount importance and a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs involved in domestic-only versus cooperative distribution is still missing. In this study we use a network Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to show circumstances under which it is in a country's self-interest to ensure other countries can obtain COVID-19 vaccines rather than focusing only on vaccination of their own residents. In particular, we focus our analysis on the United States and estimate the internal burden of COVID-19 disease under different scenarios about vaccine cooperation. We show that in scenarios in which the US has reached the threshold for domestic herd immunity, the US may find it optimal to donate doses to other countries with lower vaccination coverage, as this would allow for a sharp reduction in the inflow of infected individuals from abroad."
