1880,SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis: a single-centre experience.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020. In Romania, there have been 983,217 confirmed cases and 24,386 deaths. We aim to show our experience at the Fundeni Clinical Institute in the diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in both patients and health care personnel. Swab samples were collected for extraction of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 29380 patients and health care personnel. We have combined three real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2. Also, the presence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was analyzed in 1068 patients and clinical staff using the chemiluminescence method. Other 50 people were screened post-vaccination for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the spike (S) protein, using the chemiluminescence method as well. The majority of confirmed cases were in adults, 71.3% of cases being registered in people aged 30-69 years. Most patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (83%) were admitted to the gastroenterology, hematology, and surgery wards. Our study showed that one-third of people developed antibodies against the nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence does not vary by gender or age. Also, we noticed the presence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in all 50 people post-vaccination that were tested two weeks after the second dose. Due to the increasing number of infected patients with SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus pandemic involves a sustained testing effort for an accurate virological diagnosis in both direct and indirect diagnosis."
1881,Duration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies much shorter in India.,"Seroprevalence survey, for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, of healthcare workers (HCW) working in three Government run hospitals in Mumbai was carried out in June 2020. Among the 801 HCWs tested, seroprevalence was 11.1%. Males (13.5% vs. 8.9% in females) and ancillary workers (18.5% vs 6.9% in doctors and nurses) were more likely to be seropositive. Sixty-two (7.74%) had been previously diagnosed with RT PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 44 (71%) were seronegative. Upto 28 days after a positive PCR test, 90% of subjects were found to be seropositive. This reduced to less than half (38.5%) between 29 and 42 days. None of 28 infected HCWs who had the RT-PCR more than 50 days ago tested positive for antibodies. It seems likely that cellular immunity plays a larger role in defence against the illness."
1882,[Retrospective analysis of the performance of the SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection test compared to the reference RT-PCR test].,"Background: Discovered in 2019 in the region of Wuhan, China, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly established itself as a major pathogenic agent of morbidity and mortality. France has implemented a strategy to fight this virus which relies essentially on widespread RT-PCR virological testing in order to isolate positive patients. Antigenic tests have recently been made available to help the diagnostics. We have conducted a retrospective study to determine the sensitivity of these antigenic tests, comparing them to the reference RT-PCR method. Method: Between December 7, 2020 and January 31, 2021, each patient we received in our laboratories for an RT-PCR test was enrolled. Out of 271,649 patients, 4,881 had been submitted to an antigenic test (TDR) in the preceding 24 hours. Comparing the data resulting from both tests, we established the sensitivity and the specificity of the antigenic tests. For our analysis we included the parameter of symptom and/or the value of Cycles threshold (Ct) in our parameters. Results: The sensitivity of the TDRs compared to all the positive RT-PCR tests is 56%. We further demonstrate the correlation between the symptom duration and the reduction of the nasopharyngeal viral load. Based on this data, we have established that the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases very rapidly after symptom onset, contrary to the estimated viral load in the RT-PCR. Indeed, less the 24 hours after clinical symptom onset, the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases from 74% to 60%. By including the Ct value in our parameters, we have established that, despite a high viral load and clinical symptoms since 7 days or less, the sensitivity of the TDRs is 66%. Although, a high number of asymptomatic patients among carriers of SARS-CoV-2, we have estimated a specificity of 93% for our test. Conclusions: Performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the TDR, as assessed in practice, are inferior to those given by the manufacturer, which raises several questions. What is the impact of falsely negative results for patients carrying a high viral load? Are the implemented measures sufficient to prevent the epidemic?"

1884,Fast and cost-effective screening for SARS-CoV-2 variants in a routine diagnostic setting.,"Objective: The aim is to recommend a fast and cost-effective screening procedure for UK/SA SARS-CoV-2 variants in a routing diagnostic setting. Methods: A rapid procedure using qPCR is described to provide clinicians with information about the two currently most prevalent variants (B1.1.7 and B1.351) that harbour receptor binding domain mutation N501Y. The N501Y specific assay only delivers an amplification signal if the Y501 variant is present. Results: 436 samples initially screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 were randomly selected. Only one of these samples showed a fluorescence signal increase indicative for the Y501 variant. The remaining 435 samples had a melting peak at 54 °C indicating the N501 wildtype. Significance: The screening of a broad population base can still be performed with the established test system. In case of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding clinical and anamnestic indications, a second qPCR for the mutation N501Y can follow and deliver the result to public health authorities and to the treating physician within a few hours."

1886,Myocarditis With COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines.,"Myocarditis has been recognized as a rare complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccinations, especially in young adult and adolescent males. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, myocarditis/pericarditis rates are ≈12.6 cases per million doses of second-dose mRNA vaccine among individuals 12 to 39 years of age. In reported cases, patients with myocarditis invariably presented with chest pain, usually 2 to 3 days after a second dose of mRNA vaccination, and had elevated cardiac troponin levels. ECG was abnormal with ST elevations in most, and cardiac MRI was suggestive of myocarditis in all tested patients. There was no evidence of acute COVID-19 or other viral infections. In 1 case, a cardiomyopathy gene panel was negative, but autoantibody levels against certain self-antigens and frequency of natural killer cells were increased. Although the mechanisms for development of myocarditis are not clear, molecular mimicry between the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and self-antigens, trigger of preexisting dysregulated immune pathways in certain individuals, immune response to mRNA, and activation of immunologic pathways, and dysregulated cytokine expression have been proposed. The reasons for male predominance in myocarditis cases are unknown, but possible explanations relate to sex hormone differences in immune response and myocarditis, and also underdiagnosis of cardiac disease in women. Almost all patients had resolution of symptoms and signs and improvement in diagnostic markers and imaging with or without treatment. Despite rare cases of myocarditis, the benefit-risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination shows a favorable balance for all age and sex groups; therefore, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ≥12 years of age."

1888,A patient presenting with ARDS after COVID-19 vaccination: A COVID-19 case report.,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The introduction of vaccines against COVID-19 caused great enthusiasm around the world as immunization might end the pandemic. However, it was previously stated that COVID-19 cases would rarely continue to occur despite immunization. Fourteen days after the second dose of the vaccine, a 66-year-old male patient with a negative COVID-19 PCR test result and high levels of IgG and low levels of IgM-A against SARS-CoV-2 was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) due to the clinical picture of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). We aimed to stress the need for continuing preventive measures in vaccinated individuals, too, by presenting the clinical findings of the patient, who was considered to have developed ARDS due to COVID-19, as high levels of IgG and IgM-A against SARS-CoV-2 were detected on day 8 during ICU admission."
