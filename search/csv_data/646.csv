6450,"Predictive analysis of COVID-19 eradication with vaccination in India, Brazil, and U.S.A.","The most important question and concern in these circumstances of COVID-19 epidemic outspread is when will the pandemic end? Vaccination is the only solution to restore life to normalcy in the fastest and safest possible manner. Therefore, we have carried out a predictive analysis for realistic timescale estimates for overcoming the epidemic considering vaccination rate effect on the dynamics of COVID-19 control. In particular we discuss the worst affected large countries like India, Brazil and USA for estimating effect of vaccination rate in expediting the end of the COVID-19 epidemic. We analytically simulated the dynamic evolution of active cases of these countries in the last nine months using the modified SIR model and then included the effect of vaccination to forecast the proliferation dynamics. We hence obtained the transmission parameters, the variation in the reproduction numbers and the impact of the different values of the vaccination shots in the expected curves of active cases in the coming times to predicted the timescales of the end of the epidemic."

6453,"COVID-19: An overview of the current pharmacological interventions, vaccines, and clinical trials.","COVID-19, the greatest public health emergency of the 21st century, has affected 215 countries and territories around the world resulting in 15,151,738 confirmed cases and 621,121 deaths. The outbreak has continued at breakneck pace despite stringent public health measures, ravaging the global economy and causing profound human casualties. Vaccination is currently the best bet for the prevention of COVID-19. Still, in its absence, there has been considerable interest in repurposing existing therapeutic agents to reduce the severity of the illness and ease the burden on the already strained healthcare systems. This review outlines the current evidence regarding proposed treatments- experimental or repurposed, for COVID-19, and gives an insight into the clinical trial landscape for drugs as well as vaccines."
6454,Multiepitope Subunit Vaccine Design against COVID-19 Based on the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2: An In Silico Analysis.,"The global health crisis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19, has resulted in a negative impact on human health and on social and economic activities worldwide. Researchers around the globe need to design and develop successful therapeutics as well as vaccines against the novel COVID-19 disease. In the present study, we conducted comprehensive computer-assisted analysis on the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in order to design a safe and potent multiepitope vaccine. In silico epitope prioritization shortlisted six HLA I epitopes and six B-cell-derived HLA II epitopes. These high-ranked epitopes were all connected to each other via flexible GPGPG linkers, and at the N-terminus side, the sequence of Cholera Toxin Î² subunit was attached via an EAAAK linker. Structural modeling of the vaccine was performed, and molecular docking analysis strongly suggested a positive association of a multiepitope vaccine with Toll-like Receptor 3. The structural investigations of the vaccine-TLR3 complex revealed the formation of fifteen interchain hydrogen bonds, thus validating its integrity and stability. Moreover, it was found that this interaction was thermodynamically feasible. In conclusion, our data supports the proposition that a multiepitope vaccine will provide protective immunity against COVID-19. However, further in vivo and in vitro experiments are needed to validate the immunogenicity and safety of the candidate vaccine."
6455,Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in primary care health care workers assessed by antibody testing.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic threat of public health during the last month causing more than 10 million infections and 500 000 deceased patients worldwide. Nevertheless, data about risk of infection for health care workers are sparse. Methods: In a large primary care facility, 151 workers underwent SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing. In addition, participants had to complete a survey regarding symptoms and their individual risk of infection. Results: Symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 occurred in 72%, fever in 25% of all subjects. Four workers (2.6%, 95% confidence interval 0.8-7.1%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. None of these was free from COVID-19 suspicious symptoms. Source of infection was presumably professional in three of four individuals. Conclusion: Our systematic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of health care workers in a large outpatient centre revealed an apparently low rate of 2.6% past SARS-CoV-2 infections. Relative risk for infection following health care profession cannot be derived as data about infection rates in the corresponding general population are lacking."
6456,Health Belief Model Perspective on the Control of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and the Promotion of Vaccination in China: Web-Based Cross-sectional Study.,"Background: The control of vaccine hesitancy and the promotion of vaccination are key protective measures against COVID-19. Objective: This study assesses the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and the vaccination rate and examines the association between factors of the health belief model (HBM) and vaccination. Methods: A convenience sample of 2531 valid participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions of mainland China were enrolled in this online survey study from January 1 to 24, 2021. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the associations of the vaccination rate and HBM factors with the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy after other covariates were controlled. Results: The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 44.3% (95% CI 42.3%-46.2%), and the vaccination rate was 10.4% (9.2%-11.6%). The factors that directly promoted vaccination behavior were a lack of vaccine hesitancy (odds ratio [OR] 7.75, 95% CI 5.03-11.93), agreement with recommendations from friends or family for vaccination (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.75-5.52), and absence of perceived barriers to COVID-19 vaccination (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35-0.75). The factors that were directly associated with a higher vaccine hesitancy rate were a high level of perceived barriers (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.36-1.95) and perceived benefits (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.79). A mediating effect of self-efficacy, influenced by perceived barriers (standardized structure coefficient [SSC]=-0.71, P<.001), perceived benefits (SSC=0.58, P<.001), agreement with recommendations from authorities (SSC=0.27, P<.001), and agreement with recommendations from friends or family (SSC=0.31, P<.001), was negatively associated with vaccination (SSC=-0.45, P<.001) via vaccine hesitancy (SSC=-0.32, P<.001). Conclusions: It may be possible to increase the vaccination rate by reducing vaccine hesitancy and perceived barriers to vaccination and by encouraging volunteers to advocate for vaccination to their friends and family members. It is also important to reduce vaccine hesitancy by enhancing self-efficacy for vaccination, due to its crucial mediating function."

6458,ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaque and ferret challenge models.,"Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently required, but early development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 resulted in enhanced disease after vaccination. Careful assessment of this phenomena is warranted for vaccine development against SARS CoV-2. Here we report detailed immune profiling after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) and subsequent high dose challenge in two animal models of SARS-CoV-2 mediated disease. We demonstrate in rhesus macaques the lung pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 mediated pneumonia is reduced by prior vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 which induced neutralising antibody responses after a single intramuscular administration. In a second animal model, ferrets, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 reduced both virus shedding and lung pathology. Antibody titre were boosted by a second dose. Data from these challenge models on the absence of enhanced disease and the detailed immune profiling, support the continued clinical evaluation of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19."
6459,[Coronavirus and the risk of ocular transmission].,"Coronaviruses are a common class of respiratory viruses that can cause human infections. 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV), a new coronavirus that has recently caused a pandemic, has affected millions of people and put tremendous pressure on the health systems of almost every country in the world. Coronaviruses are known to spread from person to person through droplets or contact. The 2019-nCoV has also been found in the conjunctival secretions and tears of some clinically diagnosed patients. To assess whether the eye is one of the transmission routes of the virus, we review literature, and summarize the anatomy of the eye-nose pathway, the expression of the virus receptor in the eye, the preclinical animal studies, and the clinical data. We analyze the possibility of eyes as a means of transmission and propose some suggestions of ocular protection. (Chin J Ophthalmol, 2021, 57: 305-310)."
