3490,Altered mental status and pronounced febrile response after second mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine administration in a patient with previously documented COVID-19 infection.,"A 54-year-old man who was previously found to be COVID-19 positive received two doses of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine 4 weeks apart, as recommended by the manufacturer. He was brought to the emergency department 1 day after second dose of the vaccine with altered mental status, headache and high fever. The patient was hospitalised for 2 days and managed with supportive care. He completely recovered with return of mental status to baseline and resolution of fever."

3493,Mass severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing of asymptomatic healthcare personnel.,"Mass asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplified testing of healthcare personnel (HCP) was performed at a large tertiary health system. A low period-prevalence of positive HCP was observed. Of those who tested positive, half had mild symptoms in retrospect. HCP with even mild symptoms should be isolated and tested."

As vaccination begins, questions on advantages and disadvantages can be partially addressed using the experience from other vaccines or immune-mediated inflammatory disorders."
3495,Fully automated dried blood spot sample handling and extraction for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.,"At the beginning of 2020, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached pandemic dimensions. Throughout the event, diagnostic tests function as an essential tool for understanding, mitigating, and implement strategies to curb and reduce infections. Here, we present a novel method for the fully automated dried blood spot (DBS) sample handling and extraction for serological testing of human IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing kit. This proof-of-principle pilot study successfully demonstrates the recovery of antibodies in their intact form from DBS using automated, direct sample elution within 100 μl of extraction buffer. The use of minimally invasive DBS sampling provides an alternative to existing analytical procedures such as sampling by venipuncture or nasal swabs. Due to the ease of DBS collection, no third party need be involved, making at-home sampling possible (e.g., during quarantine)."
3496,Risk factors for positive and negative COVID-19 tests: a cautious and in-depth analysis of UK biobank data.,"Background: The recent COVID-19 outbreak has generated an unprecedented public health crisis, with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Using hospital-based or mortality data, several COVID-19 risk factors have been identified, but these may be confounded or biased. Methods: Using SARS-CoV-2 infection test data (n = 4509 tests; 1325 positive) from Public Health England, linked to the UK Biobank study, we explored the contribution of demographic, social, health risk, medical and environmental factors to COVID-19 risk. We used multivariable and penalized logistic regression models for the risk of (i) being tested, (ii) testing positive/negative in the study population and, adopting a test negative design, (iii) the risk of testing positive within the tested population. Results: In the fully adjusted model, variables independently associated with the risk of being tested for COVID-19 with odds ratio >1.05 were: male sex; Black ethnicity; social disadvantage (as measured by education, housing and income); occupation (healthcare worker, retired, unemployed); ever smoker; severely obese; comorbidities; and greater exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 absorbance. Of these, only male sex, non-White ethnicity and lower educational attainment, and none of the comorbidities or health risk factors, were associated with testing positive among tested individuals. Conclusions: We adopted a careful and exhaustive approach within a large population-based cohort, which enabled us to triangulate evidence linking male sex, lower educational attainment and non-White ethnicity with the risk of COVID-19. The elucidation of the joint and independent effects of these factors is a high-priority area for further research to inform on the natural history of COVID-19."

3498,[Analysis of Nucleotide Changes in RT-PCR Primer/Probe Binding Regions in SARS-CoV-2 Isolates Reported from Turkey].,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which caused the COVID-19 epidemic, caused more than 55 million cases and nearly 1.5 million deaths worldwide. For the microbiological diagnosis of the disease, the most valid method is detecting the presence of the viral genome by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). However, due to the nature of the RNA viruses, frequent mutations may affect the sensitivity of the analyses made on the genetic material of the virus, such as PCR. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mutations in the primer-probe binding regions of the rRT-PCR panels used in COVID-19 diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence data (n= 194) isolated from COVID-19 cases in Turkey and uploaded on GISAID database from the centers in İstanbul (n= 78), Ankara (n= 58), Kars (n= 47), Bursa (n= 2), Adıyaman (n= 2), Erciyes (n= 1) and Kocaeli (n= 1) between March 17-September 14, 2020 were analyzed. In order to determine the nucleotide changes, SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Turkey were compared to the reference genome sequence (NC_045512.1) present in ""GenBank"" website. The constructed data set was aligned using the MAFFT program and was checked manually if the sequences were in the same frame by using the AliView program. Primer-probe binding sites of the thirteen SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR panels from seven different institutes (US CDC, China CDC, Charite CDC, Pasteur, HKU, Thailand, NIID) that are being used in COVID-19 diagnosis were evaluated in terms of nucleotide changes within the corresponding regions compared to the reference genome. Sequence diversities in the viral genomes were determined via positional nucleotide numerical calculator and entropy calculator modules and nucleotide and entropy changes in primer-probe binding regions for each rRT-PCR panel were examined. Among thirteen different primer-probe panels, nucleotide changes in the target regions of the seven primer-probe panels were determined. When viral sequences with nucleotide changes in the primer-probe binding regions were examined, the most common changes were observed in the ""China CDC"" N-forward primer and ""US CDC"" N3-forward primer binding regions. It is important that the kits to be used as diagnostic tests are designed specific to the regions with less nucleotide changes. Nucleotide changes may not be critical for DNA amplification for most PCR panels, but should be carefully monitored as they may affect the sensitivity of the assay. If the risk of alteration of the designed region is high, the primer - probe binding sites should be checked frequently and updated when necessary."
