2700,Isolated syncope as a form of presentation of COVID-19 infection.,
2701,[COVID-19 Diagnosis].,"The need to curb the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the community and to diagnose those at risk of developing complications implies that an appropriate test should be chosen according to the epidemiological and clinical context. Rapid antigen tests, either nasopharyngeal or nasal, have the advantage of reflecting contagiousness better than PCR and giving an immediate result, reason why they are used as first-line for community diagnosis and screening. A rapid test allows immediate management of outpatients and does not falsely attribute the current acute episode to a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. PCR, whether nasopharyngeal or buccosalivary, is useful for epidemiological surveillance, including that of new variants, as well as identification of severe COVID in the post-infectious phase."

2703,SARS-CoV-2 Detection using Real Time PCR by a Commercial Diagnostic Kit.,"There is a new public health problem around the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV). The disease ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19) was caused by SARS-CoV-2. As virus isolates are unavailable so the public laboratories are now facing a challenge for detecting the virus because there is growing evidence of the outbreak which is more widespread than initially thought. We aimed here to discuss about the current diagnostic methodology for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 in health laboratories. Here we use the Novel Corona virus (2019-nCoV) Nucleic Acid Diagnostic Kit (PCR-Fluorescence Probing) which is a real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test. A total of 230 samples in the department of microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College from 1st, April 2020 were selected for this study. Among them 20(8.69%) were positive for SARS CoV-2 and remaining were negative. Among the positive samples 55% could amplify both the ORF 1ab and N genes. The single gene ORF 1ab or N was positive in 15% and 30% cases respectively. The Ct values (<38) of ORF 1ab gene indicated by FAM dye was 92.8% and N gene curve indicated by ROX dye was 100%. The presence of IC gene curve with Ct values (<38) indicated by CY5 dye among the positives were 70% and 100% in negatives. The Ct values (38-40) of IC (CY5) among the positives were 15%. The present study demonstrates the enormous response capacity of the study kit for detecting SARS-CoV-2 within the laboratories in Bangladesh."
2704,Early antibody response in health-care professionals after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2).,"Objectives: Data on the immune response after two doses of BNT162b2 are so far limited. Previously infected individuals were excluded from pivotal clinical trials and the optimum dose regimen in this population has not been clearly studied. The CRO-VAX HCP study aims to investigate the early antibody response in a population of health-care professionals having received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Methods: The CRO-VAX HCP study is a multicentre, prospective, interventional study conducted in several sites in Belgium. The study included 231 health-care professional volunteers who received the two-dose regimen of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Of these, 73 were previously infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 158 were uninfected and seronegative. In the first group, blood samples were collected at baseline and after 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days. In the second group, samples were obtained at baseline and after 14 and 28 days. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein were measured in all individuals at different time-points. Results: In uninfected individuals, 95.5% (95% CI 91.0%-98.2%) developed anti-spike antibodies after 14 days and a 24.9-fold rise (95% CI 21.4%-28.9%) in antibody titre was observed after the second dose. In previously infected individuals, peak antibody response was reached after 7 days (i.e. 6347 U/mL) and the second dose did not lead to significantly higher antibody titres (i.e. 8856-11 911 U/mL). Antibody titres were higher in previously infected individuals. Conclusions: This study supports the concept that a single dose of BNT162b2 would be sufficient in previously infected individuals."
2705,Genome sequencing and the diagnosis of novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) in Africa: how far are we?,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has become a pandemic. There is currently no vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19. Early diagnosis and management is key to favourable outcomes. In order to prevent more widespread transmission of the virus, rapid detection and isolation of confirmed cases is of utmost importance. Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the ""gold standard"" for the detection of SARS-COV-2. There are several challenges associated with this test from sample collection to processing and the longer turnaround time for the results to be available. More rapid and faster diagnostic tests that may produce results within minutes to a few hours will be instrumental in controlling the disease. Serological tests that detect specific antibodies to the virus may be such options. In this review, we extensively searched for studies that compared RT-PCR with serological tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We extracted the data from the various selected studies that compared the different tests and summarised the available evidence to determine which test is more appropriate especially in Africa. We also reviewed the current evidence and the challenges for the genome sequencing of SARS-COV-2 in Africa. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the different diagnostic tests and the importance of genome sequencing in identifying potential therapeutic options for the control of COVID-19 in Africa."
2706,Potential Use of Antigen-Based Rapid Test for SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory Specimens in Low-Resource Settings in Egypt for Symptomatic Patients and High-Risk Contacts.,"Objective: Because of the rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its wide public health challenges, rapid diagnosis is essential to decrease the spread. Antigen-based rapid detection tests are available; however, insufficient data about their performance are available. Methods: The lateral-flow immunochromatographic BIOCREDIT COVID-19 antigen test was evaluated using nasopharyngeal swabs in a viral transport medium from patients with confirmed infection, contacts, and exposed healthcare professionals at Fayoum University Hospital in Egypt. Test performance was determined in comparison to the SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Results: Three hundred ten specimens from 3 categories-patients with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19, contacts, and exposed healthcare professionals-were included; 188 specimens were RT-PCR-positive, from which 81 were detected by rapid antigen test. Overall sensitivity was 43.1%. Sensitivity was significantly higher in specimens with high viral loads. Conclusion: Poor sensitivity of the BIOCREDIT COVID-19 test does not permit its use for diagnosis, and it can only be used in conjunction with RT-PCR for screening."
2707,Pharmaceutical Aspects and Clinical Evaluation of COVID-19 Vaccines.,"COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in December 2019 and has since morphed into a global pandemic claiming over 2.4 million human lives and severely impacting global economy. The race for a safe and efficacious vaccine was thus initiated with government agencies as well as major pharmaceutical companies as frontrunners. An ideal vaccine would activate multiple arms of the adaptive immune system to generate cytotoxic T cell responses as well as neutralizing antibody responses, while avoiding pathological or deleterious immune responses that result in tissue damage or exacerbation of the disease. Developing an effective vaccine requires an inter-disciplinary effort involving virology, protein biology, biotechnology, immunology and pharmaceutical sciences. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the pathology and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which are fundamental to vaccine development. We then summarize the rationale for developing COVID-19 vaccines and provide novel insights into vaccine development from a pharmaceutical science perspective, such as selection of different antigens, adjuvants, delivery platforms and formulations. Finally, we review multiple clinical trial outcomes of novel vaccines in terms of safety and efficacy."
2708,Evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and more recently, the independent evolution of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants has generated renewed interest in virus evolution and cross-species transmission. While all known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are speculated to have originated in animals, very little is known about their evolutionary history and factors that enable some CoVs to co-exist with humans as low pathogenic and endemic infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1), while others, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have evolved to cause severe disease. In this review, we highlight the origins of all known HCoVs and map positively selected for mutations within HCoV proteins to discuss the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we discuss emerging mutations within SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern (VOC), along with highlighting the demonstrated or speculated impact of these mutations on virus transmission, pathogenicity, and neutralization by natural or vaccine-mediated immunity."
