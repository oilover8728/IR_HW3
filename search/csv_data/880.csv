8790,Assessment of Air Contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in Hospital Settings.,"Importance: Controversy remains regarding the transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objective: To review current evidence on air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings and the factors associated with contamination, including viral load and particle size. Evidence review: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically queried for original English-language articles detailing SARS-CoV-2 air contamination in hospital settings between January 1 and October 27, 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patients. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per meter cubed of air were pooled, and their distribution was described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per meter cubed were analyzed after categorization as less than 1 μm, from 1 to 4 μm, and greater than 4 μm. Findings: Among 2284 records identified, 24 cross-sectional observational studies were included in the review. Overall, 82 of 471 air samples (17.4%) from close patient environments were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a significantly higher positivity rate in intensive care unit settings (intensive care unit, 27 of 107 [25.2%] vs non-intensive care unit, 39 of 364 [10.7%]; P < .001). There was no difference according to the distance from patients (≤1 m, 3 of 118 [2.5%] vs >1-5 m, 13 of 236 [5.5%]; P = .22). The positivity rate was 5 of 21 air samples (23.8%) in toilets, 20 of 242 (8.3%) in clinical areas, 15 of 122 (12.3%) in staff areas, and 14 of 42 (33.3%) in public areas. A total of 81 viral cultures were performed across 5 studies, and 7 (8.6%) from 2 studies were positive, all from close patient environments. The median (interquartile range) SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.0 × 103 copies/m3 (0.4 × 103 to 3.1 × 103 copies/m3) in clinical areas to 9.7 × 103 copies/m3 (5.1 × 103 to 14.3 × 103 copies/m3) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. Protective equipment removal and patient rooms had high concentrations per titer of SARS-CoV-2 (varying from 0.9 × 103 to 40 × 103 copies/m3 and 3.8 × 103 to 7.2 × 103 TCID50/m3), with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the region of particle size less than 1 μm; staff offices had peaks in the region of particle size greater than 4 μm. Conclusions and relevance: In this systematic review, the air close to and distant from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, few of these samples contained viable viruses. High viral loads found in toilets and bathrooms, staff areas, and public hallways suggest that these areas should be carefully considered."
8791,Preventing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Exhalation Upon Tracheal Extubation in the Intensive Care Unit: A Case Series.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious virus transmitted by inhalation of infected matter containing live virus or by exposure from contaminated surfaces. Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) create an increased risk of airborne transmission of infection. Tracheal extubation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a risky AGP procedure owing to the proximity of the staff members to the patients' mouths and the exposure to airway secretions. We describe the use of a disposable openable mask (Janus Mask, Biomedical Srl, Florence, Italy) that might limit aerosol generation in the periextubation phase of COVID-19 cardiac surgical patients."

As of April 11th, 2020, there were almost 2 million cases of COVID‐19 internationally and over 100,000 deaths (John Hopkins University, 2020). There has been significant effort to increase hospital and healthcare capacity to reduce the number of fatalities associated with this global pandemic (Choi & Logsdon 2020)."
8795,Genetics Insight for COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: A Review.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from an asymptomatic to a severe clinical course. The host genetic background influence on the susceptibility and outcome of multiples infectious diseases has been previously reported. Herein, we aimed to describe relevant identified genetic variants and those potentially related to the inter-individual variability of COVID-19 susceptibility and/or severity considering the physiopathological pathway of the disease The HLA-A*25:01, -B*15:27, -B*46:01, -C*01:02, and -C*07:29 alleles have been associated with COVID-19 susceptibility; while HLA-A*02:02, -B*15:03, and -C*12:03 have been identified as low-risk alleles. Variants in cytokine genes such as IL1B, IL1R1, IL1RN, IL6, IL17A, FCGR2A, and TNF could be related to disease susceptibility and cytokine storm, and/or COVID-19 complications (e.g., venous thrombosis). Several variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 affecting the expression of the receptors related to COVID-19 have been associated with the disease susceptibility and risk factors. Finally, two GWAS have identified the loci 3p21.31 (LZTFL1, SLC6A20, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1) and 9q34.2 (ABO) with COVID-19 severity. Heterogeneous results in the association of genetic variants with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity were observed. The mechanism of identified risk-genes and studies in different populations are still warranted."

8797,Pathophysiology of infection with SARS-CoV-2-What is known and what remains a mystery.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused extensive disruption and mortality since its recent emergence. Concomitantly, there has been a race to understand the virus and its pathophysiology. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are manifold and not restricted to the respiratory tract. Extrapulmonary manifestations involving the gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary system, cardiovascular and renal systems have been widely reported. However, the pathophysiology of many of these manifestations is controversial with questionable support for direct viral invasion and an abundance of alternative explanations such as pre-existing medical conditions and critical illness. Prior research on SARS-Co-V and NL63 was rapidly leveraged to identify angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as the key cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The distribution of ACE2 has been used as a starting point for estimating vulnerability of various tissue types to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sophisticated organoid and animal models have been used to demonstrate such infectivity of extrapulmonary tissues in vitro, but the clinical relevance of these findings remains uncertain. Clinical autopsy studies are typically small and inevitably biased towards patients with severe COVID-19 and prolonged hospitalization. Technical issues such as delay between time of death and autopsy, use of inappropriate antibodies for paraffin-embedded tissue sections and misinterpretation of cellular structures as virus particles on electron micrograph images are additional problems encountered in the extant literature. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to circulate permanently in human populations, there is no doubt that further work is required to clarify the pathobiology of COVID-19."

8799,Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis of ACE2: A Potential Mechanism Contributing to COVID-19 Pathogenesis?,"Since being identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2, Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been studied as one of the potential targets for the development of preventative and/or treatment options. Tissue expression of ACE2 and the amino acids interacting with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been mapped. Furthermore, the recombinant soluble extracellular domain of ACE2 is already in phase 2 trials as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most studies have continued to focus on the ACE2 extracellular domain, which is known to play key roles in the renin angiotensin system and in amino acid uptake. However, few also found ACE2 to have an immune-modulatory function and its intracellular tail may be one of the signaling molecules in regulating cellular activation. The implication of its immune-modulatory role in preventing the cytokine-storm, observed in severe COVID-19 disease outcomes requires further investigation. This review focuses on the regulated proteolytic cleavage of ACE2 upon binding to inducer(s), such as the spike protein of SARS-CoV, the potential of cleaved ACE2 intracellular subdomain in regulating cellular function, and the ACE2's immune-modulatory function. This knowledge is critical for targeting ACE2 levels for developing prophylactic treatment or preventative measures in SARS-CoV infections."
