7961,Knowing and combating the enemy: a brief review on SARS-CoV-2 and computational approaches applied to the discovery of drug candidates.,"Since the emergence of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 in China, and with the urge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been huge efforts of many research teams and governmental institutions worldwide to mitigate the current scenario. Reaching more than 1,377,000 deaths in the world and still with a growing number of infections, SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical issue for global health and economic systems, with an urgency for available therapeutic options. In this scenario, as drug repurposing and discovery remains a challenge, computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches, including machine learning (ML) techniques, can be useful tools to the design and discovery of novel potential antiviral inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we describe and review the current knowledge on this virus and the pandemic, the latest strategies and computational approaches applied to search for treatment options, as well as the challenges to overcome COVID-19."

7964,At what times during infection is SARS-CoV-2 detectable and no longer detectable using RT-PCR-based tests? A systematic review of individual participant data.,"Background: Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are pivotal to detecting current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and duration of detectable virus indicating potential for infectivity. Methods: We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) systematic review of longitudinal studies of RT-PCR test results in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. We searched PubMed, LitCOVID, medRxiv, and COVID-19 Living Evidence databases. We assessed risk of bias using a QUADAS-2 adaptation. Outcomes were the percentage of positive test results by time and the duration of detectable virus, by anatomical sampling sites. Results: Of 5078 studies screened, we included 32 studies with 1023 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants and 1619 test results, from - 6 to 66 days post-symptom onset and hospitalisation. The highest percentage virus detection was from nasopharyngeal sampling between 0 and 4 days post-symptom onset at 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83 to 93) dropping to 54% (95% CI 47 to 61) after 10 to 14 days. On average, duration of detectable virus was longer with lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling than upper respiratory tract (URT). Duration of faecal and respiratory tract virus detection varied greatly within individual participants. In some participants, virus was still detectable at 46 days post-symptom onset. Conclusions: RT-PCR misses detection of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; early sampling minimises false negative diagnoses. Beyond 10 days post-symptom onset, lower RT or faecal testing may be preferred sampling sites. The included studies are open to substantial risk of bias, so the positivity rates are probably overestimated."
7965,Quantitative evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation using a deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode.,"Inactivation technology for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is certainly a critical measure to mitigate the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) would be a promising candidate to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, based on the well-known antiviral effects of DUV on microorganisms and viruses. However, due to variations in the inactivation effects across different viruses, quantitative evaluations of the inactivation profile of SARS-CoV-2 by DUV-LED irradiation need to be performed. In the present study, we quantify the irradiation dose of DUV-LED necessary to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we determined the culture media suitable for the irradiation of SARS-CoV-2 and optimized the irradiation apparatus using commercially available DUV-LEDs that operate at a center wavelength of 265, 280, or 300 nm. Under these conditions, we successfully analyzed the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and the irradiation dose of the DUV-LEDs at each wavelength without irrelevant biological effects. In conclusion, total doses of 1.8 mJ/cm2 for 265 nm, 3.0 mJ/cm2 for 280 nm, and 23 mJ/cm2 for 300 nm are required to inactivate 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2. Our results provide quantitative antiviral effects of DUV irradiation on SARS-CoV-2, serving as basic knowledge of inactivation technologies against SARS-CoV-2."
7966,"COVID-19 Vaccines: ""Warp Speed"" Needs Mind Melds, Not Warped Minds.","In this review, we address issues that relate to the rapid ""Warp Speed"" development of vaccines to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. We review the antibody response that is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of humans and how it may inform vaccine research. The isolation and properties of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients provide additional information on what vaccines should try to elicit. The nature and longevity of the antibody response to coronaviruses are relevant to the potency and duration of vaccine-induced immunity. We summarize the immunogenicity of leading vaccine candidates tested to date in animals and humans and discuss the outcome and interpretation of virus challenge experiments in animals. By far the most immunogenic vaccine candidates for antibody responses are recombinant proteins, which were not included in the initial wave of Warp Speed immunogens. A substantial concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is adverse events, which we review by considering what was seen in studies of SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) vaccines. We conclude by outlining the possible outcomes of the Warp Speed vaccine program, which range from the hoped-for rapid success to a catastrophic adverse influence on vaccine uptake generally."
7967,Impact of COVID-19 on Nephrology Patients: A Mechanistic Outlook for Pathogenesis of Acute Kidney Injury.,"Context: Some research has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has had effects on the various functions of the renal system. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a dangerous and broadly spread pathological illness. Objective: In this review, we emphasize that AKI can be a severe complication of COVID-19 and highlight the importance of assessing, defining, and reporting the course of AKI. Design: The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19. Articles published on or before May 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: ""Coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""AKI"" or ""renal failure"" or ""nephrology"". Setting: This study was take place at Jouf University, Sakaka, Al-Jouf, Saudi Arabia. Results: The review showed that AKI patients, who were susceptible to a cytokine storm, showed clinical deterioration. This result allowed the current research team to develop a hypothesis of a set of adverse events in COVID-19 that proposes the modification of inflammatory pathways by stimulation of nAChRα7. The stimulation could occur by way of IL-6 / JAK2 / STAT3 / SOCS3 and NF-κB (p65)/IL-18, which work together to induce AKI and increase overall renal-related diagnostic markers, such as plasma creatinine and tubular cell damage. In addition, the functioning of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may be determined by nicotine. Pharmacological nicotine products are widely available, and their role in COVID-19-mediated AKI can be further evaluated. Conclusions: The research team concluded that the dysregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system could explain most of the clinical features of severe COVID-19."
7968,Clinical Performance of the Luminex NxTAG CoV Extended Panel for SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Nasopharyngeal Specimens from COVID-19 Patients in Hong Kong.,"In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in the Hubei province of China and later spread all over the world. There was an urgent need of a high-throughput molecular test for screening the COVID-19 patients in the community. The Luminex NxTAG CoV extended panel is a high-throughput FDA emergency use-authorized molecular diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This system targets three genes (ORF1ab, N, and E genes) of SARS-CoV-2, the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV, and the ORF5 region of MERS-CoV. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of this system with nasopharyngeal swab specimens of 214 suspected COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong. The results were compared with our routine COVID-19 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) protocol with a LightMix SarbecoV E-gene kit and an in-house RdRp/Hel RT-PCR assay. The NxTAG CoV extended panel demonstrated 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. On low-viral load specimens, the sensitivity of the NxTAG panel could still maintain at 85.71%. Strong agreement was observed between the NxTAG panel and the routine COVID-19 RT-PCR protocol (kappa value = 0.98). Overall, the E gene target of the NxTAG panel demonstrated the highest sensitivity among the three SARS-CoV-2 targets, while the N gene targets demonstrated the least. In conclusion, the NxTAG CoV extended panel is simple to use, and it has high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. We recommend this diagnostic system for high-throughput COVID-19 screening in the community."
