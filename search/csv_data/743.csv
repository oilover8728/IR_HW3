7420,"Diabetes, inflammation, and the adiponectin paradox: Therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV-2.","Aging and pre-existing conditions in older patients increase severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severity and its complications, although the causes remain unclear. Apart from acute pulmonary syndrome, Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) can increasingly induce chronic conditions. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 triggers de novo type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) linked to age-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancers, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammation, possibly through damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signaling and 'cytokine storm,' causing insulin resistance and the adiponectin (APN) paradox, a phenomenon linking metabolic dysfunction to chronic disease. Accordingly, preventing the APN paradox by suppressing APN-related inflammatory signaling might prove beneficial. A better understanding could uncover novel therapies for SARS-CoV-2 and its chronic disorders."

Mitigation protocols* were evaluated and modified based on data from routine reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19); proximity tracking devices; and detailed interviews. Midseason, transmission was observed in persons who had cumulative interactions of <15 minutes' duration, leading to a revised definition of high-risk contacts that required consideration of mask use, setting and room ventilation in addition to proximity and duration of interaction. The NFL also developed an intensive protocol that imposed stricter infection prevention precautions when a case was identified at an NFL club. The intensive protocol effectively prevented the occurrence of high-risk interactions, with no high-risk contacts identified for 71% of traced cases at clubs under the intensive protocol. The incorporation of the nature and location of the interaction, including mask use, indoor versus outdoor setting, and ventilation, in addition to proximity and duration, likely improved identification of exposed persons at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Quarantine of these persons, along with testing and intensive protocols, can reduce spread of infection."

7424,Initial chest CT findings in COVID-19: correlation with clinical features.,"In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new de novo infectious disease, was first identified in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across China and around the world. The etiology was a novel betacoronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Lu et al., 2020). On Mar. 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. As of Mar. 22, 2020, over 292 000 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported globally. To date, COVID-19, with its high infectivity, has killed more people than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) combined (Wu and McGoogan, 2020)."

Methods: We assessed via an online questionnaire the preparedness of European hospital laboratories for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and listed the main drawbacks for implementation. Results: Forty-five percent of the surveyed labs had a test in place by March 26th which is well into the first wave of the pandemic in most countries. Conclusions: The main implementation barriers for introduction of a SARSCoV-2 molecular assay in European diagnostic laboratories were availability of positive controls and a specificity panel."

7428,Development of a genotyping platform for SARS-CoV-2 variants using high-resolution melting analysis.,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been expanding globally since late 2019. SARS-CoV-2, an RNA virus, has a genome sequence that can easily undergo mutation. Several mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains, including those with higher infectivity than others, have been reported. To reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is crucial to trace its infection sources. Here, we developed a simple, easy-to-use genotyping method to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants using a high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Methods: We investigated five mutation sites, A23403G, G25563T, G26144T, T28144C, and G28882A, which are known strain determinants according to GISAID clades (L, S, V, G, GH, and GR). Results: We first employed synthetic DNA fragments containing the five characteristic sites for HRM analysis. All sequences clearly differentiated wild-type from mutant viruses. We then confirmed that RNA fragments were suitable for HRM analysis following reverse transcription. Human saliva did not negatively affect the HRM analysis, which supports the absence of a matrix effect. Conclusions: Our results indicate that this HRM-based genotyping method can identify SARS-CoV-2 variants. This novel assay platform potentially paves the way for accurate and rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection sources."
7429,"Cluster of Coronavirus Disease Associated with Fitness Dance Classes, South Korea.","During 24 days in Cheonan, South Korea, 112 persons were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 associated with fitness dance classes at 12 sports facilities. Intense physical exercise in densely populated sports facilities could increase risk for infection. Vigorous exercise in confined spaces should be minimized during outbreaks."
