9530,"Clinical Profile, Viral Load, Maternal-Fetal Outcomes of Pregnancy With COVID-19: 4-Week Retrospective, Tertiary Care Single-Centre Descriptive Study.","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic raises a major concern about its severity in pregnancy, maternal-fetal outcomes, and risk of vertical transmission. We report a retrospective descriptive study of the clinical course and maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. Methods: This is a single-centre, retrospective study performed in a tertiary care hospital for pregnant women with COVID-19 in India. The medical records of all women who delivered in the COVID19 facility from May 5, 2020, to June 5, 2020, were reviewed independently. Data extracted from the records included demographic characteristics, obstetric details, comorbidities, disease severity, investigations, management, and information on neonates (birthweight, Apgar score, and perinatal complications). Results: Among 348 women tested for SARS-CoV-2, 57 women (16.3%) were confirmed as positive based on quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the nasopharyngeal specimen. Most women (45; 78.9%) had a mild infection with favourable maternal-fetal outcomes. Three maternal deaths were associated with comorbidities. Five neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, remained hemodynamically stable, and were subsequently discharged. Conclusions: A majority of pregnant women with COVID-19 had mild disease and recovered with good perinatal outcomes. Women with comorbidities may have an increased risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The cycle threshold signifying the viral load and degree of infectivity can modify management during pregnancy. Long-term outcomes and the potential mother-to-child vertical/horizontal transmission need further study."

9532,Neutralizing antibody vaccine for pandemic and pre-emergent coronaviruses.,"Betacoronaviruses caused the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as the current pandemic of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1-4. Vaccines that elicit protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses that circulate in animals have the potential to prevent future pandemics. Here we show that the immunization of macaques with nanoparticles conjugated with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, and adjuvanted with 3M-052 and alum, elicits cross-neutralizing antibody responses against bat coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (including the B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variants). Vaccination of macaques with these nanoparticles resulted in a 50% inhibitory reciprocal serum dilution (ID50) neutralization titre of 47,216 (geometric mean) for SARS-CoV-2, as well as in protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Nucleoside-modified mRNAs that encode a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric receptor-binding domain also induced cross-neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV and bat coronaviruses, albeit at lower titres than achieved with the nanoparticles. These results demonstrate that current mRNA-based vaccines may provide some protection from future outbreaks of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, and provide a multimeric protein platform for the further development of vaccines against multiple (or all) betacoronaviruses."
9533,COVID-19 vaccination and low cervical lymphadenopathy in the two week neck lump clinic - a follow up audit.,"The UK COVID vaccination programme has progressed at an astonishing rate since the first patients received their doses in December 2020. It is well known that other vaccines including influenza and human papilloma virus (HPV) can result in reactive lymphadenopathy in the axilla and/or neck. Patients are now presenting via the two week wait neck lump clinic with supraclavicular fossa and low neck lymphadenopathy related to COVID vaccination, and to similar one stop breast clinics with axillary lymph nodes. In an audit of 80 patients seen over a period of one month, we found COVID vaccine-related low neck lymphadenopathy in four cases (5%), with an additional rectal cancer patient thought to have metastatic disease who presented with a Virchow type node. COVID vaccine-related lymphadenopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of low-neck nodes if they occurred shortly after vaccination, but it is important to exclude sinister disease using ultrasound and other investigations as necessary."
9534,The effect of latitude and PM(2.5) on spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in tropical and temperate zone countries.,"The present work describes spreading of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the tropical and temperate zones which are explained based on insolation energy, Particulate Matter (PM2.5), latitude, temperature, humidity, Population Density (PD), Human Development Index (HDI) and Global Health Security Index (GHSI) parameters. In order to analyze the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 by statistical data based on the confirmed positive cases which are collected between December 31, 2019 to April 25, 2020. The present analysis reveals that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the major countries lie on the Equator is 78,509 cases, the countries lie on the Tropic of Cancer is 62,930 cases (excluding China) and the countries lie on the Tropic of Capricorn is 22,842 cases. The tropical countries, which comes between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn is reported to be 1,77,877 cases. The temperate zone countries, which are above and below the tropical countries are reported to be 25,66,171 cases so, the pandemic analysis describes the correlation between latitude, temperate zones, PM2.5 and local environmental factors. Hence, the temperature plays a pivotal role in the spreading of coronavirus at below 20 °C. The spreading of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Northern and Southern Hemispheres has inverse order against absorption of insolated energy. In temperate zone countries, the concentration of PM2.5 at below 20 μg/m3 has higher spreading rate of SARS-CoV-2 cases. The effect of insolation energy and PM2.5, it is confirmed that the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 is explained by dumb-bell model and solid/liquid interface formation mechanism. The present meta-analysis also focuses on the impact of GHSI, HDI, PD and PM2.5 on spreading of SARS-CoV-2 cases."
9535,"Past, present, and future of COVID-19: a review.","SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged, becoming a global threat, affecting directly all human beings owing to its morbidity and mortality and indirectly, due to the enormous economic and psychological impact produced by social isolation, the most effective measure so far, but unsustainable for a long period. The scientific effort to understand and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission and clinical impact has been huge, and important achievements are highlighted in this review. Diagnosis is central and is the first step in recognizing and fighting any infectious agent. Instrumental to that is the quality of the data, relying on serological and molecular surveys in addition to trustworthy clinical records. However, the fast spread of a virus adapted for human-to-human respiratory transmission raised a demand for millions of molecular tests that are simply not available. Several candidate drugs are under evaluation in clinical trials. Those with an already recognized safety profile are more auspicious, since, if proven effective, can cut several steps of production and phase 2 and 3 trials. More than one hundred vaccine prototypes are in different stages of development, however, safety and efficacy evaluations cannot be obviated, implicating, most optimistically, in at least months for us to have an effective immunization, the definite measure to allow a safe return to the pre-pandemic lifestyle. Science has never been more necessary and present in daily life. Relying on the best of human wit is the only way out to this pandemic, saving as many lives as possible."
9536,"Neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in stray animals from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel Betacoronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became a public health emergency worldwide. Few reports indicate that owned pets from households with at least one human resident that was diagnosed with COVID-19 can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 of pets from households with no COVID-19 cases or stray animals remains less assessed. Using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90), we investigated the infection and previous exposure of dogs and cats to SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From June to August 2020, 96 animals were sampled, including 49 cats (40 owned and 9 stray) and 47 dogs (42 owned and 5 stray). Regarding owned pets, 75.6% (62/82) belonged to households with no COVID-19 cases. Samples included serum, and rectal and oropharyngeal swabs. All swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but serum samples of a stray cat and a stray dog presented neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, with PRNT90 titer of 80 and 40, respectively. Serological data presented here suggest that not only owned pets from households with COVID19 cases, but also stray animals are being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic."
9537,Reinfection or Reactivation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: A Systematic Review.,"As the pandemic continues, individuals with re-detectable positive (RP) SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA among recovered COVID-19 patients have raised public health concerns. It is imperative to investigate whether the cases with re-detectable positive (RP) SARS-CoV-2 might cause severe infection to the vulnerable population. In this work, we conducted a systematic review of recent literature to investigate reactivation and reinfection among the discharged COVID-19 patients that are found positive again. Our study, consisting more than a total of 113,715 patients, indicates that the RP-SARS-CoV-2 scenario occurs plausibly due to reactivation, reinfection, viral shedding, or testing errors. Nonetheless, we observe that previously infected individuals have significantly lower risk of being infected for the second time, indicating that reactivation or reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 likely have relatively less impact in the general population than the primary infection."

9539,A Comprehensive Review of COVID-19 Associated Neurological Manifestations.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor of cells in order to gain entry and continue infection. Recent literature has focused on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other associated pulmonary complications; however, only a scarce amount of literature exists on neurological complications. Such complications also pose a high morbidity in these patients. The exact pathogenesis of nervous system involvement by COVID-19 still remains poorly understood. The aim of this article is to review the neurological symptoms seen in COVID-19 infection and discuss the probable pathogenesis, management and outcome of associated neurological complications."
