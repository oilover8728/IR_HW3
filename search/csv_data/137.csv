1361,An unexpected COVID-19 diagnosis during emergency surgery in a neonate.,"A 4-day-old, 3.3 kg infant presented with suspected intestinal malrotation, necessitating emergent diagnostic laparoscopy. Intra-operatively, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) came back positive. This is the first case report of emergency surgery and anesthesia in a positive SARS-CoV-2 newborn. This report highlights a neonate with an incidental positive SARS-CoV-2 test, no known exposure history, negative polymerase chain reaction maternal testing, and absence of respiratory symptoms who required modified pressure control ventilation settings to adequately ventilate with the high-efficiency particulate air filter in situ."
1362,[Monitoring the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae: Coronavirinae: Betacoronavirus; Sarbecovirus) variants in the Moscow region using targeted high-throughput sequencing].,"Introduction: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus, the international community has been concerned about the emergence of mutations altering some biological properties of the pathogen like increasing its infectivity or virulence. Particularly, since the end of 2020, several variants of concern have been identified around the world, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2). However, the existing mechanism of detecting important mutations are not always effective enough, since only a relatively small part of all pathogen samples can be examined by whole genome sequencing due to its high cost. Material and methods: In this study, we have designed special primer panel and used it for targeted highthroughput sequencing of several significant S-gene (spike) regions of SARS-CoV-2. The Illumina platform averaged approximately 50,000 paired-end reads with a length of â‰¥150 bp per sample. This method was used to examine 579 random samples obtained from COVID-19 patients in Moscow and the Moscow region from February to June 2021. Results: This study demonstrated the dynamics of distribution of several SARS-CoV-2 strains and its some single mutations. It was found that the Delta strain appeared in the region in May 2021, and became prevalent in June, partially displacing other strains. Discussion: The obtained results provide an opportunity to assign the viral samples to one of the strains, including the previously mentioned in time- and cost-effective manner. The approach can be used for standardization of the procedure of searching for mutations in individual regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. It allows to get a more detailed data about the epidemiological situation in a region."
1363,COVID-19 challenges and its therapeutics.,"COVID-19, an infectious disease, has emerged as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making it one of the severe public health issues in recent decades. nCoV, the novel SARS coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has brought together scientists in the quest for possible therapeutic and preventive measures. The development of new drugs to manage COVID-19 effectively is a challenging and time-consuming process, thus encouraging extensive investigation of drug repurposing and repositioning candidates. Several medications, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir, ribavirin, ritonavir, interferons, azithromycin, capivasertib and bevacizumab, are currently under clinical trials for COVID-19. In addition, several medicinal plants with considerable antiviral activities are potential therapeutic candidates for COVID-19. Statistical data show that the pandemic is yet to slow down, and authorities are placing their hopes on vaccines. Within a short period, four types of vaccines, namely, whole virus, viral vector, protein subunit, and nucleic acid (RNA/DNA), which can confer protection against COVID-19 in different ways, were already in a clinical trial. SARS-CoV-2 variants spread is associated with antibody escape from the virus Spike epitopes, which has grave concerns for viral re-infection and even compromises the effectiveness of the vaccines. Despite these efforts, COVID-19 treatment is still solely based on clinical management through supportive care. We aim to highlight the recent trends in COVID-19, relevant statistics, and clinical findings, as well as potential therapeutics, including in-line treatment methods, preventive measures, and vaccines to combat the prevalence of COVID-19."
1364,COVID-19 Vaccines: Current Status and Implication for Use in Indonesia.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has inflicted catastrophic damages in public health, economic and social stability-putting life globally on hold in 2020 and presumably a year more. Indonesia bears a heavy burden of the pandemic, counting the highest case prevalence and fatality rate in all of Southeast Asia. One hope remains in the groundbreaking universal effort in search of a vaccine against the causative virus SARS-CoV-2, which has shown success unparalleled in human vaccine development thus far. An array of modalities including novel techniques are being utilized as vaccine platforms, with the closest to phase III clinical trial completion being mRNA (manufactured by Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer), inactivated virus (Sinovac, Sinopharm), viral vector (Oxford/AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, Janssen/Johnson&Johnson, CanSino), and protein subunit (Novavax). The vaccine produced by BioNTech/Pfizer has been deployed to the public as the first ever licensed COVID-19 vaccine. In this review, we will review all of these modalities on their safety and immunogenicity, phase II/III trial results of the nine vaccine candidates and current situation as of 29 December 2020, as well as the implication for use and distribution in Indonesia. COVID-19 vaccine progress, however, is moving exceedingly fast and new advances are unfolding on a daily basis, to which we hope an update to this review can be published in early 2021."

1366,COVID-19: concern about interrupting social isolation of healthcare workers and professionals. What should be done with the results of the available COVID-19 diagnostic tests?,"Management of SARS-CoV-2 requires safe decision-making to minimize contamination. Healthcare workers and professionals in confined areas are affected by the risk of the activity and the environment. Isolation of contaminated workers and healthcare professionals requires clinical and diagnostic criteria. On the other hand, interrupting the isolation of healthcare employees and professionals is critical because diagnostic tests do not support clinical decisions. In addition to defining the best test in view of its accuracy, it is necessary to consider aspects such as the stage of the disease or cure, the viral load and the individual's own immunity. Uncertainty about natural and herd immunity to the disease leads to the development of appropriate antivirals, diagnostic tests and vaccines."
1367,SARS-CoV-2: Immune Response Elicited by Infection and Development of Vaccines and Treatments.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) announced in March a pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This new infectious disease was named Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), and at October 2020, more than 39,000,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected worldwide leading to near 1,100,000 deaths. Clinically, COVID-19 is characterized by clinical manifestations, such as fever, dry cough, headache, and in more severe cases, respiratory distress. Moreover, neurological-, cardiac-, and renal-related symptoms have also been described. Clinical evidence suggests that migration of immune cells to the affected organs can produce an exacerbated release of proinflammatory mediators that contribute to disease and render the immune response as a major player during the development of the COVID-19 disease. Due to the current sanitary situation, the development of vaccines is imperative. Up to the date, 42 prototypes are being tested in humans in different clinical stages, with 10 vaccine candidates undergoing evaluation in phase III clinical trials. In the same way, the search for an effective treatment to approach the most severe cases is also in constant advancement. Several potential therapies have been tested since COVID-19 was described, including antivirals, antiparasitic and immune modulators. Recently, clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine-a promising drug in the beginning-were suspended. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved convalescent serum administration as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 patients. Moreover, monoclonal antibody therapy is also under development to neutralize the virus and prevent infection. In this article, we describe the clinical manifestations and the immunological information available about COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, we discuss current therapies under study and the development of vaccines to prevent this disease."

1369,"Evaluating a novel, highly sensitive, and quantitative reagent for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen.","Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is rapidly spreading all over the world. A new quantifying reagent for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen was developed for early and accurate detection. We evaluated the novel quantitative reagent for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen using an automated laboratory device. Methods: One-hundred nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 47 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and 200 samples were collected from healthy donners. We measured the SARS-CoV-2 antigen and nucleic acid using Lumipulse Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag and the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit, respectively. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen test were 75.7% (56/74) and 96.0% (192/200), respectively. The concordance rate in the positive group between the antigen and nucleic acid tests was 66% (66/100). In addition, the correlation coefficient between the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 0.74. There were 19 discrepant samples in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected without SARS-CoV-2 antigen. There was significant difference between the discrepant and matched samples in terms of the time since symptom onset: the 19 discrepant samples were collected a median of 33 days after onset, while the 55 matched samples were collected a median of 19 days after onset. In addition, the 19 discrepant samples were collected from patients who were immune against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: This novel SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection assay is highly sensitive, rapid, accurate, easily diagnostic. It may be useful in both clinical diagnosis and in screening because it does not require special methods such as PCR."
