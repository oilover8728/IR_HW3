9360,Underdetection of cases of COVID-19 in France threatens epidemic control.,"As countries in Europe gradually relaxed lockdown restrictions after the first wave, test-trace-isolate strategies became critical to maintain the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at low levels1,2. Reviewing their shortcomings can provide elements to consider in light of the second wave that is currently underway in Europe. Here we estimate the rate of detection of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in France after lockdown through the use of virological3 and participatory syndromic4 surveillance data coupled with mathematical transmission models calibrated to regional hospitalizations2. Our findings indicate that around 90,000 symptomatic infections, corresponding to 9 out 10 cases, were not ascertained by the surveillance system in the first 7 weeks after lockdown from 11 May to 28 June 2020, although the test positivity rate did not exceed the 5% recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO)5. The median detection rate increased from 7% (95% confidence interval, 6-8%) to 38% (35-44%) over time, with large regional variations, owing to a strengthening of the system as well as a decrease in epidemic activity. According to participatory surveillance data, only 31% of individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms consulted a doctor in the study period. This suggests that large numbers of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 did not seek medical advice despite recommendations, as confirmed by serological studies6,7. Encouraging awareness and same-day healthcare-seeking behaviour of suspected cases of COVID-19 is critical to improve detection. However, the capacity of the system remained insufficient even at the low epidemic activity achieved after lockdown, and was predicted to deteriorate rapidly with increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. Substantially more aggressive, targeted and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a tool to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The testing strategy will be critical to enable partial lifting of the current restrictive measures in Europe and to avoid a third wave."
9361,Short-term outcome of pregnant women vaccinated with BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.,"Objectives: To determine the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine among pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women, and to evaluate obstetric outcome following vaccination. Methods: This was an observational case-control study of pregnant women who were vaccinated with a two-dose regimen of the BNT162b2 vaccine during gestation between January and February 2021 (study group) and age-matched non-pregnant women who received the vaccine during the same time period (control group). Participants received a digital questionnaire 1-4 weeks after the second dose and were asked to provide information regarding demographics, medication, medical history, history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, timing of COVID-19 vaccine doses and side effects after each vaccine dose. A second digital questionnaire, regarding current pregnancy and delivery outcomes, was sent to patients in the study group after the calculated due date. All recruited women were offered a serology blood test for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) following the second vaccination dose and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were compared between the two groups. Results: Of 539 pregnant women who were recruited after completion of the two-dose regimen of the vaccine, 390 returned the digital questionnaire and were included in the study group and compared to 260 age-matched non-pregnant vaccinated women. The rates of rash, fever and severe fatigue following vaccination among pregnant women were comparable to those in non-pregnant women. Myalgia, arthralgia and headache were significantly less common among pregnant women after each dose, local pain or swelling and axillary lymphadenopathy were significantly less common among pregnant women after the first and second doses, respectively, while paresthesia was significantly more common among the pregnant population after the second dose. Among pregnant women, there were no significant differences in the rates of side effects according to whether the vaccine was administered during the first, second or third trimester of pregnancy, except for local pain/swelling, which was significantly less common after the first dose when administered during the third trimester, and uterine contractions, which were significantly more common after the second dose when administered during the third trimester. The rates of obstetric complications, including uterine contractions (1.3% after the first dose and 6.4% after the second dose), vaginal bleeding (0.3% after the first dose and 1.5% after the second dose) and prelabor rupture of membranes (0% after the first dose and 0.8% after the second dose), were very low following vaccination. All serum samples in both groups were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. However, pregnant women had significantly lower serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels compared to non-pregnant women (signal-to-cut-off ratio, 27.03 vs 34.35, respectively; P < 0.001). Among the 57 pregnant women who delivered during the study period and who completed the second questionnaire, median gestational age at delivery was 39.5 (interquartile range, 38.7-40.0) weeks, with no cases of preterm birth < 37 weeks, no cases of fetal or neonatal death and two (3.5%) cases of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory support. Conclusions: The adverse-effect profile and short-term obstetric and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women who were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine at any stage of pregnancy do not indicate any safety concerns. The vaccine is effective in generating a humoral immune response in pregnant women, although SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were lower than those observed in non-pregnant vaccinated women. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology."
9362,Minimising duplicate reports in estimating the impact of COVID-19.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) disease (COVID‐19) in China at the end of 2019 brought with it uncertainty as to whether it would bring an increase in maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. This uncertainty drove fear; understandable given the high case fatality rate associated with previous severe respiratory illness causing coronaviruses."
9363,Kinetic Characterization and Inhibitor Screening for the Proteases Leading to Identification of Drugs against SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has claimed many lives worldwide and is still spreading since December 2019. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are essential for maturation of viral polyproteins in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and thus regarded as key drug targets for the disease. In this study, 3CLpro and PLpro assay platforms were established, and their substrate specificities were characterized. The assays were used to screen collections of 1,068 and 2,701 FDA-approved drugs. After excluding the externally used drugs which are too toxic, we totally identified 12 drugs as 3CLpro inhibitors and 36 drugs as PLpro inhibitors active at 10 μM. Among these inhibitors, six drugs were found to suppress SARS-CoV-2 with the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) below or close to 10 μM. This study enhances our understanding on the proteases and provides FDA-approved drugs for prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19."
9364,Relationship Between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the Etiology of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI).,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since it was first recognized in December 2019, it has resulted in the ongoing worldwide pandemic. Although acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main features of the disease, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. There has been a growing concern regarding the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and poor outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Based on current observational data, AKI is the 2nd most common cause of morbidity and mortality behind ARDS in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has been shown to be the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly plays a significant role in the occurrence of renal injury. The pathogenesis of AKI is likely multifactorial that involves not only direct viral invasion but also dysregulated immune response in the form of cytokine storm, ischemia to kidneys, hypercoagulable state, and rhabdomyolysis, among others. We performed a literature search of the Pubmed and Google Scholar database from 1996 to 2020 using the following keywords: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and acute kidney injury to find the most pertinent and highest-quality of evidence. Any cited references were reviewed to identify relevant literature. The purpose of this review is to discuss, explore, and summarize the relationship between AKI in SARS-CoV-2 patients, with a focus on its epidemiology, association with ACE2 receptors, and pathophysiology of AKI."
9365,Assessing the Burden of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Among Healthcare Workers in Mexico City: A Data-Driven Call to Action.,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) could be at increased occupational risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections due to increased exposure. Information regarding the burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in HCWs living in Mexico is scarce. Here, we aimed to explore the epidemiology, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in Mexico City. Methods: We explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City, in HCWs who underwent real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. We explored COVID-19 outcomes in HCWs and the performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: As of 20 September 2020, 57 758 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 17 531 were confirmed (30.35%); 6610 were nurses (37.70%), 4910 physicians (28.0%), 267 dentists (1.52%), and 5744 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (32.76%). Overall, 2378 HCWs required hospitalization (4.12%), 2648 developed severe COVID-19 (4.58%), and 336 required mechanical-ventilatory support (.58%). Lethality was recorded in 472 (.82%) cases. We identified 635 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.62%). Compared with general population, HCWs had higher incidence, testing, asymptomatic cases, and mortality rates. No individual symptom offers adequate performance to detect SARS-CoV2. Older HCWs with chronic noncommunicable diseases and severe respiratory symptoms were associated with higher risk for adverse outcome; physicians were at higher risk compared with nurses and other HCWs. Conclusions: We report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs in Mexico City. Symptoms as a screening method are not efficient to discern those HCWs with a positive PCR-RT test. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes."
9366,SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating in northern Italy since December 2019: Evidence from environmental monitoring.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease COVID-19, a public health emergency worldwide, and Italy is among the most severely affected countries. The first autochthonous Italian case of COVID-19 was documented on February 21, 2020. We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Italy earlier than that date, by analysing 40 composite influent wastewater samples collected - in the framework of other wastewater-based epidemiology projects - between October 2019 and February 2020 from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in three cities and regions in northern Italy (Milan/Lombardy, Turin/Piedmont and Bologna/Emilia Romagna). Twenty-four additional samples collected in the same WWTPs between September 2018 and June 2019 (i.e. long before the onset of the epidemic) were included as 'blank' samples. Viral concentration was performed according to the standard World Health Organization procedure for poliovirus sewage surveillance, with modifications. Molecular analysis was undertaken with both nested RT-PCR and real-rime RT-PCR assays. A total of 15 positive samples were confirmed by both methods. The earliest dates back to 18 December 2019 in Milan and Turin and 29 January 2020 in Bologna. Virus concentration in the samples ranged from below the limit of detection (LOD) to 5.6 × 104 genome copies (g.c.)/L, and most of the samples (23 out of 26) were below the limit of quantification of PCR. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in northern Italy at the end of 2019. Moreover, it was circulating in different geographic regions simultaneously, which changes our previous understanding of the geographical circulation of the virus in Italy. Our study highlights the importance of environmental surveillance as an early warning system, to monitor the levels of virus circulating in the population and identify outbreaks even before cases are notified to the healthcare system."
9367,Brazilian Older People Hospitalized by COVID-19: Characteristics and Prognostic Factors in a Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Objective: Analyzing the survival of older people hospitalized due to COVID-19 in Brazil and identifying its main predictive factors for death. Method: This is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study, based on 20,831 records of hospitalizations of older people due to SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil. The observation period was from February 28 to May 18, 2020. Results: There was a reduced overall survival time of 47.70% (95% confidence interval [CI] = [46.72%, 48.67%]) in 10 days. The variables age, race, education, intensive care unit (ICU), region, day of hospitalization, time elapsed between the first symptom and hospitalization, and the municipality that provided assistance showed increased risk of death using the multiple Cox proportional-hazards model. Conclusion: These results emphasize the relevance of inequality and access to health services as determinants for the death of older people with COVID-19."
9368,Features of Cytokine Storm Identified by Distinguishing Clinical Manifestations in COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new coronavirus, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is currently spreading all over the world. In this paper, we developed a practical model for identifying the features of cytokine storm, which is common in acute infectious diseases and harmful manifestation of COVID-19, by distinguishing major and minor clinical events. This model is particularly suitable for identifying febrile and infectious diseases like COVID-19. Based on this model, features of cytokine storm and pathogenesis of COVID-19 have been proposed to be a consequence of the disequilibrated cytokine network resulting from increased biological activity of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which induces certain clinical manifestations such as fatigue, fever, dry cough, pneumonia, abatement and losing of olfactory, and taste senses in some patients. Research and clarification of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 will contribute to precision treatment. Various anti-TGF-β therapies may be explored as potential COVID-19 treatment. This novel model will be helpful in reducing the widespread mortality of COVID-19."
9369,Children's heart and COVID-19: Up-to-date evidence in the form of a systematic review.,"The new coronavirus disease outbreak in 2019 (COVID-19) represents a dramatic challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. As to viral tropism, lungs are not the only COVID-19 target but also the heart may be involved in a not negligible percentage of the infected patients. Myocarditis-related cardiac dysfunction and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias are the main aftermaths. A few studies showed that myocardial injury in adult patients is often linked with a fatal outcome. Conversely, scientific evidence in children is sparse, although several reports were published with the description of a cardiac involvement in COVID-19 paediatric patients. In these young subjects, a background of surgically treated congenital heart disease seems to be a predisposing factor.Conclusion: This systematic review is aimed at summarizing all COVID-19 cases with a cardiac involvement published in paediatric age and trying to explain the underlying mechanisms responsible for COVID-19-related myocardial damage.What is Known:• Coronaviruses proved to be able to jump from animals to humans.• The outbreak of COVID-19 started from China (Dec 2019) and became pandemic.What is New:• Even in childhood, COVID-19 is not without the risk of cardiac involvement.• Myocarditis, heart failure, and arrhythmias are among the possible manifestations."
