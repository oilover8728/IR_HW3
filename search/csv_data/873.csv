8720,The importance of cycle threshold values in interpreting molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2.,"Using the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV assay (Seegene, South Korea), 285 samples were tested; 49 (17%) were positive for 3 genes, 4 (1.4%) samples were positive for 2 genes (all N gene and RdRP gene), 8 (3%) samples were positive for 1 gene (all N gene only), and 224 (78.5%) samples were negative."
8721,The Grim Reality of Health System Uncovered with COVID-19 Pandemic in Nepal.,"With advent of community transmission of COVID-19 in Nepal, the number of cases continues to rise and poses threat to the fragile health system of our country. 'Trace, isolate, test and treat' is the strategy advocated by World Health Organization to fight against COVID-19. Despite the efforts for last nine months, Nepal lacks in some aspect of this strategy. Lack of prompt testing facilities and substandard quarantine and isolation centers, have led to mismanagement of cases. The panic regarding COVID-19, lack of adequate protective measures to healthcare workers in early stage of the pandemic, and nation-wise lockdown, has led to collateral damage in the form of increased morbidity and mortality due to non-COVID related illnesses. COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the grim reality of the debilitated health system of our country. With mass influx of Nepali migrant workers, the epidemic is expected to grow exponentially. We need to understand that the health system of Nepal must be prepared to function to its maximum capacity in the coming days. Keywords: COVID-19; health; Nepal; pandemic."
8722,"Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from Bangladesh: Insights into the origin, mutational spectrum and possible pathomechanism.","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), rages across the world, killing hundreds of thousands and infecting millions, researchers are racing against time to elucidate the viral genome. Some Bangladeshi institutes are also in this race, sequenced a few isolates of the virus collected from Bangladesh. Here, we present a genomic analysis of these isolates. The analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 isolates sequenced from Dhaka and Chittagong were the lineage of Europe and India, respectively. Our analysis identified a total of 42 mutations, including three large deletions, half of which were synonymous. Most of the missense mutations in Bangladeshi isolates found to have weak effects on the pathogenesis. Some mutations may lead the virus to be less pathogenic than the other countries. Molecular docking analysis to evaluate the effect of the mutations on the interaction between the viral spike proteins and the human ACE2 receptor, though no significant difference was observed. This study provides some preliminary insights into the origin of Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 isolates, mutation spectrum and its possible pathomechanism, which may give an essential clue for designing therapeutics and management of COVID-19 in Bangladesh."

8724,SARS-CoV-2 RBD trimer protein adjuvanted with Alum-3M-052 protects from SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune pathology in the lung.,"There is a great need for the development of vaccines that induce potent and long-lasting protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Multimeric display of the antigen combined with potent adjuvant can enhance the potency and longevity of the antibody response. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we developed a trimeric form of the RBD and show that it induces a potent neutralizing antibody response against live virus with diverse effector functions and provides protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in mice and rhesus macaques. The trimeric form induces higher neutralizing antibody titer compared to monomer with as low as 1μg antigen dose. In mice, adjuvanting the protein with a TLR7/8 agonist formulation alum-3M-052 induces 100-fold higher neutralizing antibody titer and superior protection from infection compared to alum. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes significant loss of innate cells and pathology in the lung, and vaccination protects from changes in innate cells and lung pathology. These results demonstrate RBD trimer protein as a suitable candidate for vaccine against SARS-CoV-2."
8725,Cupric Oxide Coating That Rapidly Reduces Infection by SARS-CoV-2 via Solids.,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created a need for coatings that reduce infection from SARS-CoV-2 via surfaces. Such a coating could be used on common touch surfaces (e.g., door handles and railings) to reduce both disease transmission and fear of touching objects. Herein, we describe the design, fabrication, and testing of a cupric oxide anti-SARS-CoV-2 coating. Rapid loss of infectivity is an important design criterion, so a porous hydrophilic coating was created to allow rapid infiltration of aqueous solutions into the coating where diffusion distances to the cupric oxide surface are short and the surface area is large. The coating was deposited onto glass from a dispersion of cuprous oxide in ethanol and then thermally treated at 700 °C for 2 h to produce a CuO coating that is ≈30 μm thick. The heat treatment oxidized the cuprous oxide to cupric oxide and sintered the particles into a robust film. The SARS-CoV-2 infectivity from the CuO film was reduced by 99.8% in 30 min and 99.9% in 1 h compared to that from glass. The coating remained hydrophilic for at least 5 months, and there was no significant change in the cross-hatch test of robustness after exposure to 70% ethanol or 3 wt % bleach."
8726,"Detection of coronavirus-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in conjunctival swabs from patients with severe form of Coronavirus disease 2019 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.","Objectives: To test conjunctival swabs from patients with laboratory-confirmed severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Methods: Fifty conjunctival swabs were collected from 50 in-patients with laboratory-confirmed severe forms of COVID-19 at the largest teaching hospital and referral center in Brazil (HCFMUSP, São Paulo, SP). The samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 on rRT-PCR with the primers and probes described in the CDC protocol which amplify the region of the nucleocapsid N gene (2019_nCoV_N1 and 2019_nCoV_N2) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and compared with naso/oropharyngeal swabs collected within 24 hours of the conjunctival swabs. Results: Five conjunctival samples (10%) tested positive (amplification of the N1 and N2 primer/probe sets) while two conjunctival samples (4%) yielded inconclusive results (amplification of the N1 primer/probe set only). The naso/oropharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on rRT-PCR in 34 patients (68%), negative in 14 (28%) and inconclusive in 2 (4%). The 5 patients with positive conjunctival swabs had positive (n=2), negative (n=2) or inconclusive (n=1) naso/oropharyngeal swabs on rRT-PCR. Patients with negative or inconclusive naso/oropharyngeal swabs had the diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by previous positive rRT-PCR results or by serology. Conclusion: This is the first study to present conjunctival swab rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in a Brazilian population. In our sample of 50 patients with severe forms of COVID-19, 10% had positive conjunctival swabs, most of which were correlated with positive naso/oropharyngeal rRT-PCR results."

8728,"Rapid, large-scale, and effective detection of COVID-19 via non-adaptive testing.","Pooling of samples can increase lab capacity when using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect diseases such as COVID-19. However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real-time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation."
