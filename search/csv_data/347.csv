3461,Successful treatment of 28 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 at a medical center in Taiwan.,"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic. We present the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 28 COVID-19 patients treated in our hospital in Taiwan. Methods: Patients with COVID-19, confirmed by positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral nucleic acids from oropharyngeal swab specimens between February 4, 2020 and July 6, 2020, were enrolled. Their clinical characteristics and outcomes were reviewed. Results: Seventeen of the 28 patients (60.7%) had pneumonia. The most frequent symptoms were cough (n = 23, 82.1%) and fever (n = 17, 60.7%). The development of pneumonia was associated with age ≥40 years (p < 0.024), body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 (p = 0.014), fever (p = 0.007), shortness of breath (p = 0.036), chills ((p = 0.047), and lower platelet counts (<200,000/μL) (p = 0.007). Increased quarantine duration was associated with age ≥40 years (p = 0.026), Charlson index ≥1 (p = 0.037), lower lymphocyte (<1500/uL; p = 0.028) or platelet counts (<200,000/μL) (p = 0.016), lower serum sodium (<140 mEq/L; p = 0.006), and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level (≥1 mg/dl; p = 0.04). Treatment with hydroxychloroquine or in combination with other medicines did not reduce the quarantine duration. All 28 patients recovered with a median quarantine duration of 27.2 days. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with older age, higher BMI, fever, chills or shortness of breath, lower serum sodium level, lower platelet or lymphocyte count, and higher CRP level may be associated with developing pneumonia or longer quarantine duration."
3462,Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. Methods: In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. Results: A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusions: A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368728.)."

3464,Absence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 RNA in Human Corneal Tissues.,"Purpose: To examine corneal tissue for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity regarding implications for tissue procurement, processing, corneal transplantation, and ocular surgery on healthy patients. We performed quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction qRT-PCR-testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on corneal stroma and endothelium, bulbar conjunctiva, conjunctival fluid swabs, anterior chamber fluid, and corneal epithelium of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) postmortem donors. Methods: Included in this study were 10 bulbi of 5 COVID-19 patients who died because of respiratory insufficiency. Informed consent and institutional review board approval was obtained before this study (241/2020BO2). SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using a pharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage. Tissue procurement and tissue preparation were performed with personal protective equipment (PPE) and the necessary protective measures. qRT-PCR-testing was performed for each of the abovementioned tissues and intraocular fluids. Results: The qRT-PCRs yielded no viral RNA in the following ocular tissues and intraocular fluid: corneal stroma and endothelium, bulbar-limbal conjunctiva, conjunctival fluid swabs, anterior chamber fluid, and corneal epithelium. Conclusions: In this study, no SARS-CoV-2-RNA was detected in conjunctiva, anterior chamber fluid, and corneal tissues (endothelium, stroma, and epithelium) of COVID-19 donors. This implicates that the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection using corneal or conjunctival tissue is very low. However, further studies on a higher number of COVID-19 patients are necessary to confirm these results. This might be of high importance for donor tissue procurement, processing, and corneal transplantation."
3465,Evaluation of Orthogonal Testing Algorithm for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody testing is an important tool in assessment of pandemic progress, contact tracing, and identification of recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We evaluated an orthogonal testing algorithm (OTA) to improve test specificity in these use cases. Methods: A two-step OTA was applied where individuals who initially tested positive were tested with a second test. The first-line test, detecting IgG antibodies to the viral nucleocapsid protein, was validated in 130 samples and the second-line test, detecting IgG antibodies to the viral spike protein in 148 samples. The OTA was evaluated in 4333 clinical patient specimens. The seropositivity rates relative to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rates were evaluated from our entire patient population data (n = 5102). Results: The first-line test resulted in a clinical sensitivity of 96.4% (95% CI; 82.3% to 99.4%), and specificity of 99.0% (95% CI; 94.7% to 99.8%), whereas the second-line test had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI; 87.1% to 100%) and specificity of 98.4% (95% CI; 94.2% to 99.5%). Using the OTA, 78/98 (80%) of initially positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG results were confirmed with a second-line test, while 11/42 (26%) of previously diagnosed COVID-19 patients had no detectable antibodies as long as 94 days post PCR diagnosis. Conclusion: Our results show that an OTA can be used to identify patients who require further follow-up due to potential SARS CoV-2 IgG false positive results. In addition, serological testing may not be sufficiently sensitive to reliably detect prior COVID-19 infection."

3467,A SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Variant that Affects Antigen Test Performance.,"More than one year into a global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now defined by a variety of rapidly evolving variant lineages. Several FDA authorized molecular diagnostic tests have been impacted by viral variation, while no reports of viral variation affecting antigen test performance have occurred to date. While determining the analytical sensitivity of the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2), we uncovered a high viral load specimen that repeatedly tested negative by this antigen test. Whole genome sequencing of the specimen uncovered two mutations, T205I and D399N, present in the nucleocapsid protein of the isolate. All six SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens available in our laboratory with a D399N nucleocapsid mutation and CT < 31 were not detected by the Sofia 2 but detected by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, while clinical specimens with the T205I mutation were detected by both assays. Testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid with these variants demonstrated an approximate 1000-fold loss in sensitivity for the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test associated with the D399N mutation, while the BinaxNOW and Quidel Quickvue SARS Antigen tests were unaffected by the mutation. The D399N nucleocapsid mutation has been relatively uncommon to date, appearing in only 0.02% of genomes worldwide at time of writing. Our results demonstrate how routine pathogen genomics can be integrated into the clinical microbiology laboratory to investigate diagnostic edge cases, as well as the importance of profiling antigenic diversity outside of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics."

3469,Antibody Response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in Subjects with Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Although antibody levels progressively decrease following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune memory persists for months. Thus, individuals who naturally contracted SARS-CoV-2 are expected to develop a more rapid and sustained response to COVID-19 vaccines than naïve individuals. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of the antibody response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in six healthcare workers who contracted SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020, in comparison to nine control subjects without a previous infection. The vaccine was well tolerated by both groups, with no significant difference in the frequency of vaccine-associated side effects, with the exception of local pain, which was more common in previously infected subjects. Overall, the titers of neutralizing antibodies were markedly higher in response to the vaccine than after natural infection. In all subjects with pre-existing immunity, a rapid increase in anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibody titers was observed one week after the first dose, which seemed to act as a booster. Notably, in previously infected individuals, neutralizing antibody titers 7 days after the first vaccine dose were not significantly different from those observed in naïve subjects 7 days after the second vaccine dose. These results suggest that, in previously infected people, a single dose of the vaccine might be sufficient to induce an effective response."
