2320,Typical symptoms of common otorhinolaryngological diseases may mask a SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Purpose: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates predominantly in the upper respiratory tract and is primarily transmitted by droplets and aerosols. Taking the medical history for typical COVID-19 symptoms and PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing have become established as screening procedures. The aim of this work was to describe the clinical appearance of SARS-CoV-2-PCR positive patients and to determine the SARS-CoV-2 contact risk for health care workers (HCW). Methods: The retrospective study included n = 2283 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests from n = 1725 patients with otorhinolaryngological (ORL) diseases performed from March to November 2020 prior to inpatient treatment. In addition, demographic data and medical history were assessed. Results: n = 13 PCR tests (0.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The positive rate showed a significant increase during the observation period (p < 0.01). None of the patients had clinical symptoms that led to a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 before PCR testing. The patients were either asymptomatic (n = 4) or had symptoms that were interpreted as symptoms typical of the ORL disease or secondary diagnoses (n = 9). Conclusion: The identification of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients is a considerable challenge in clinical practice. Our findings illustrate that taking a medical history alone is of limited value and cannot replace molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially for patients with ORL diseases. Our data also demonstrate that there is a high probability of contact with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in everyday clinical practice, so that the use of personal protective equipment, even in apparently ""routine cases"", is highly recommended."

2322,Impact of vaccination on new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United Kingdom.,"The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in the general community is still unclear. Here, we used the Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey-a large community-based survey of individuals living in randomly selected private households across the United Kingdom-to assess the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca; ChAdOx1) vaccines against any new SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests, split according to self-reported symptoms, cycle threshold value (<30 versus ≥30; as a surrogate for viral load) and gene positivity pattern (compatible with B.1.1.7 or not). Using 1,945,071 real-time PCR results from nose and throat swabs taken from 383,812 participants between 1 December 2020 and 8 May 2021, we found that vaccination with the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines already reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections ≥21 d after the first dose (61% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 54-68%) versus 66% (95% CI = 60-71%), respectively), with greater reductions observed after a second dose (79% (95% CI = 65-88%) versus 80% (95% CI = 73-85%), respectively). The largest reductions were observed for symptomatic infections and/or infections with a higher viral burden. Overall, COVID-19 vaccination reduced the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections, with the largest benefit received after two vaccinations and against symptomatic and high viral burden infections, and with no evidence of a difference between the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines."

2324,SARS-CoV-2 viral load assessment in respiratory samples.,"Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRTPCR) has been the main method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. De-identified results from upper and lower respiratory samples submitted to a reference laboratory demonstrated a positivity rate of 14.9 % (4428 of 29,713 samples tested). Distribution of results by birth year cohort and specimen type suggested general consistency in mean, median and peak values but higher positivity rates in individuals born from 1964 to 1974. Female patients had a significantly lower positivity rate (P < 0.0001), although similar load mean and median values, compared to males. Overall, 15.3 % (676 of 4428 positive results) of positive results had viral loads greater than 8 log10 copies/mL, with occasional samples exceeding 10 log10 copies/mL. These results support quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patient testing and efforts to control viral transmission."
2325,"Delayed Antibody and T-Cell Response to BNT162b2 Vaccination in the Elderly, Germany.",We detected delayed and reduced antibody and T-cell responses after BNT162b2 vaccination in 71 elderly persons (median age 81 years) compared with 123 healthcare workers (median age 34 years) in Germany. These data emphasize that nonpharmaceutical interventions for coronavirus disease remain crucial and that additional immunizations for the elderly might become necessary.
2326,"Performance of Repeat BinaxNOW Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antigen Testing in a Community Setting, Wisconsin, November 2020-December 2020.",Repeating the BinaxNOW antigen test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using 2 groups of readers within 30 minutes resulted in high concordance (98.9%) in 2110 encounters. Same-day repeat antigen testing did not significantly improve test sensitivity (77.2% to 81.4%) while specificity remained high (99.6%).
2327,[Immunogenicity and safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in healthcare workers].,"Összefoglaló. Bevezetés: A SARS-CoV-2 koronavírus okozta COVID-19 általános egészségügyi és gazdasági krízist idézett elő. Célkitűzés: A megfigyeléses vizsgálat célja a BNT162b2 mRNS-Pfizer-BioNTech-vakcina hatásosságának, biztonságosságának és immunogenitásának igazolása a Budai Irgalmasrendi Kórház dolgozóin. Módszer: A vakcina adása után elemeztük a COVID-19-fertőzés előfordulását, az oltások utáni reakciókat, valamint a ""spike"" (S-) protein és a nukleokapszid (N)-protein elleni ellenanyag szintjének változását. Eredmények: A felmérésben részt vevő 295 dolgozó közül az oltást megelőzően 36 dolgozó esett át COVID-19-fertőzésen (COVID-19-pozitív csoport). A második oltás után a megfigyelési időszak három hónapjában COVID-19-fertőzés nem alakult ki a felmérésben részt vevő oltott dolgozók körében. Az oltási reakciók enyhék voltak. A COVID-19-pozitív csoportban az N-antitestek medián küszöbértékindexe az első vakcina után 4 héttel mérve szignifikánsan magasabb volt (28,37), mint a COVID-19-negatív (0,085) csoportban (p<0,0001). Az első vakcina után 4 héttel az S-antitestek medián értéke (8015 U/ml) a COVID-19-pozitív csoportban szignifikánsan magasabb volt (p<0,0001), mint a COVID-19-negatív csoportban (23,18 U/ml). A COVID-19-negatív csoport S-antitest-középértéke a második vakcina után szignifikáns (p<0,0001), mintegy 500×-os emelkedést mutatott (23,18 U/ml ről 1173 U/ml-re). Egy vakcina hatásosságát a fertőzések terjedésének megakadályozása igazolja. Következtetések: A második vakcina utáni megfigyelési időszakban új COVID-19-fertőzés nem volt az oltott dolgozók körében. A fertőzésen át nem esett COVID-19-negatív egyének esetén az S-antitest emelkedése mérsékelt az első oltás után, míg a második oltás után lényegesen emelkedik. A COVID-19-fertőzésen átesett egyének csoportjában már az első vakcina is jelentős S-antitest-termelődést vált ki. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(39): 1551-1557. Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused global public health and economic crises. Objective: The aim of this observation study was to estimate the effectiveness, safety and elicited immune response of the BNT162b2 mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in healthcare workers of the Buda Hospital of the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God. Method: After vaccination, the infection rate, adverse events and the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein antibodies were evaluated. Results: Before vaccination, from the 295 healthcare workers 36 recovered from prior COVID-19 infection (COVID-19-positive group). After the second vaccination, there was no COVID-19 infection during the three-month follow-up period. The adverse events were mild. In the COVID-19-positive group, the median cut-off index of anti-N antibodies measured at 4 weeks after the first vaccination were significantly (p<0.0001) higher (28.37) than in the COVID-19-negative group (0.085). After the first vaccine, the median titer of anti-S antibodies was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the COVID-19-positive group (8015 U/ml) compared to the COVID-19-negative group (23.18 U/ml). In the COVID-19-negative group, the median titer of anti-S antibodies increased significantly (p<0.0001) after the second vaccine (from 23.18 U/ml to 1173 U/ml), showing an increase of 500×. Conclusions: After the second vaccination, there was no COVID-19 infection during the follow-up. In the COVID-19-negative group, the anti-S antibody titer is moderate after the first vaccination and increases significantly after the second vaccine. In the COVID-19-positive group, the first vaccine induces significant anti-S antibody production. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(39): 1551-1557."

2329,Humoral immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine administration in seropositive and seronegative individuals.,"Background: The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, there are three approved vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in the USA, including two based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology that has demonstrated high vaccine efficacy. We sought to characterize humoral immune responses, at high resolution, during immunization with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in individuals with or without prior history of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We determined antibody responses after each dose of the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in individuals who had no prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (seronegative) and individuals that had previous viral infection 30-60 days prior to first vaccination (seropositive). To do this, we used both an antibody isotype-specific multiplexed bead-based binding assays targeting multiple SARS-CoV-2 viral protein antigens and an assay that identified potential SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels. Moreover, we mapped antibody epitope specificity after immunization using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide arrays. Results: Antibody levels were significantly higher after a single dose in seropositive individuals compared to seronegative individuals and were comparable to levels observed in seronegative individuals after two doses. While IgG was boosted by vaccination for both seronegative and seropositive individuals, only seronegative individuals had increased IgA or IgM antibody titers after primary immunization. We identified immunodominant peptides targeted on both SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and S2 subunits after vaccination. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 immunization in seropositive and seronegative individuals and provide support for the concept of using prior infection history as a guide for the consideration of future vaccination regimens. Moreover, we identified key epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are targeted by antibodies after vaccination that could guide future vaccine and immune correlate development."
