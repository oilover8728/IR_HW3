250,State-of-the-Art of Nanodiagnostics and Nanotherapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.,"The pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, with millions of infected patients worldwide, has severely challenged all aspects of public health. In this regard, early and rapid detection of infected cases and providing effective therapeutics against the virus are in urgent demand. Along with conventional clinical protocols, nanomaterial-based diagnostics and therapeutics hold a great potential against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Indeed, nanoparticles with their outstanding characteristics would render additional advantages to the current approaches for rapid and accurate diagnosis and also developing prophylactic vaccines or antiviral therapeutics. In this review, besides presenting an overview of the coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, we discuss the introduced nanomaterial-based detection assays and devices and also antiviral formulations and vaccines for coronaviruses."
251,Rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 using potential point-of-care electrochemical immunosensor: Toward the future prospects.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging and highly infectious disease making global public health concern and socio-economic burden. It is caused due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). It has the tendency to spread rapidly through person-to-person. Currently, several molecular diagnostic platforms such as PCR, qRT-PCR, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), CRISPR are utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. These conventional techniques are costly, time consuming and require sophisticated instrumentation facility with well trained personnel for testing. Hence, it is tough to provide testing en-masse to the people in developing countries. On the other hand, several serological biosensors such as lateral flow immunosensor, optical, electrochemical, microfluidics integrated electrochemical/fluorescence is currently utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. In current pandemic situation, there is an urgent need of rapid and efficient diagnosis on mass scale of SARS-CoV-2 for early stage detection. Early monitoring of viral infections can help to control and prevent the spreading of infections in large chunk of population. In this review, the SARS-CoV-2 and their biomarkers in biological samples, collection of samples and recently reported potential electrochemical immunosensors for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed."
252,Intricacies in characterizing positivity in pooled sample testing for SARS-CoV-2.,"The unprecedented demand for testing for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has led to an acute shortage and limited availability of test reagents for which pooling of samples has been recommended in areas with low prevalence. Considering the possibility of dilution factor in pool testing, an attempt was made to find out possibility of any true positive samples in pools with late amplification. The study was conducted on samples received from various collection centers in different districts of Odisha as well as from patients attending the screening clinic or admitted in COVID ward of the hospital. Nasal/nasopharyngeal/throat swabs received in viral transport media in cold chain were subjected to Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in a Biosafety Laboratory level-2 by including uniform volume of four units (samples) per pool. All confirmed and probable positive pools in screening assay were de-convoluted and individual samples tested for confirmatory assay. Inclusion of an additional criteria of probable positive pool (Ct value >35 with non-sigmoid amplification curve or showing a line of amplification towards the end of the cycle) yielded 39 (15.5%) more true positive samples out of a total of 251 positive samples that would otherwise have been missed if only the classical criteria of positive (Ct within 35 with proper sigmoid curve) had been considered. The study highlights the importance of considering any indication of late amplification in the RT-PCR test to label a pool as positive to avoid missing any true positive sample in the pool."
253,Combined throat/nasal swab sampling for SARS-CoV-2 is equivalent to nasopharyngeal sampling.,"Purpose: PCR on a nasopharyngeal sample is the reference method for the detection of SARS-nCoV-2. However, combined throat/nasal sampling as a testing method has several advantages. We compared the combined throat/nasal sampling with nasopharyngeal sampling for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers suspected of COVID-19. Methods: In 107 healthcare workers with symptoms of COVID-19, combined throat/nasal sampling and nasopharyngeal sampling was performed. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by RT-PCR targeting. Results: A total of 80 healthcare workers (74.8%) tested negative with both sampling methods, and 25 healthcare workers (23.4%) tested positive with both sampling methods. There were two discrepant results with positive PCR in combined throat/nasal swabs and negative PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs (1.9%). The κ index for concordance between the 2 sampling methods was high (0.95). The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR on nasopharyngeal samples was significantly lower than the Ct value of PCR on combined throat/nasal samples (19 (IQR 17-20) versus 21 (IQR 18-29) cycles, p value 0.01). Conclusion: Combined throat/nasal swabs yield a similar sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 as nasopharyngeal swabs and are a good alternative sampling method, despite a lower Ct value for the nasopharyngeal samples."
254,A mobile DNA laboratory for forensic science adapted to coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.,"The Forensic Science Institute of the French ""Gendarmerie Nationale"" (IRCGN™) developed in 2015 an ISO 17025 certified mobile DNA laboratory for genetic analyses. This Mobil'DNA laboratory is a fully autonomous and adaptable mobile laboratory to perform genetic analyses in the context of crime scenes, terrorism attacks or disasters. To support the hospital task force in Paris during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic, we adapted this mobile genetic laboratory to perform high-throughput molecular screening for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. We describe the adaptation of this Mobil'DNA lab to assist in Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis."
255,Implementation and evaluation of a novel real-time multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2: in-field learnings from a clinical microbiology laboratory.,"The unprecedented scale of testing required to effectively control the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated urgent implementation of rapid testing in clinical microbiology laboratories. To date, there are limited data available on the analytical performance of emerging commercially available assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and integration of these assays into laboratory workflows. Here, we performed a prospective validation study of a commercially available assay, the AusDiagnostics Coronavirus Typing (8-well) assay. Respiratory tract samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing were collected between 1 March and 25 March 2020. All positive samples and a random subset of negative samples were sent to a reference laboratory for confirmation. In total, 2673 samples were analysed using the Coronavirus Typing assay. The predominant sample type was a combined nasopharyngeal/throat swab (2640/2673; 98.8%). Fifty-four patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (2.0%) using the Coronavirus Typing assay; 53/54 (98.1%) positive results and 621/621 (100%) negative results were concordant with the reference laboratory. Compared to the reference laboratory gold standard, sensitivity of the Coronavirus Typing assay for SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (95% CI 93.2-100%), specificity 99.8% (95% CI 99.1-100%), positive predictive value 98.1% (95% CI 90.2-99.7%) and negative predictive value 100% (95% CI 99.4-100%). In many countries, standard regulatory requirements for the introduction of new assays have been replaced by emergency authorisations and it is critical that laboratories share their post-market validation experiences, as the consequences of widespread introduction of a suboptimal assay for SARS-CoV-2 are profound. Here, we share our in-field experience, and encourage other laboratories to follow suit."
256,Design and Multicenter Clinical Validation of a 3-Dimensionally Printed Nasopharyngeal Swab for SARS-CoV-2 Testing.,"Importance: Three-dimensionally printed nasopharyngeal swabs (3DP swabs) have been used to mitigate swab shortages during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Clinical validation for diagnostic accuracy and consistency, as well as patient acceptability, is crucial to evaluate the swab's performance. Objective: To determine the accuracy and acceptability of the 3DP swab for identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Design, setting, and participants: A diagnostic study was conducted from May to July 2020 at 2 tertiary care centers in Singapore with different reference swabs (FLOQSwab [COPAN Diagnostics] or Dacron swab [Deltalab]) and swab processing techniques (wet or dry) to evaluate the performance of the 3DP swab compared with traditional, standard-of-care nasopharyngeal swabs used in health care institutions. The participants were patients with COVID-19 in the first 2 weeks of illness and controls with acute respiratory illness with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the same nostril and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of swabs was randomized based on odd and even participant numbers. Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcome measures were overall agreement (OA), positive percentage agreement (PPA), and negative percentage agreement of the 3DP swab compared with reference swabs. Secondary outcome measures were the correlation of cycle threshold (Ct) values of both swabs. Results: The mean (SD) age of participants was 45.4 (13.1) years, and most participants were men (87 of 89 [97.8%]), in keeping with the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. A total of 79 patients with COVID-19 and 10 controls were recruited. Among the patients with COVID-19, the overall agreement and PPA of the 3DP swab was 91.1% and 93.5%, respectively, compared with reference swabs. The PPA was 100% for patients with COVID-19 who were tested within the first week of illness. All controls tested negative. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction Ct values for the ORF1ab and E-gene targets showed a strong correlation (intraclass correlations coefficient, 0.869-0.920) between the 3DP and reference swab on independent testing at each institution despite differences in sample processing. Discordant results for both gene targets were observed only at high Ct values. Conclusions and relevance: In this diagnostic study of 79 patients with COVID-19 and 10 controls, the 3DP swab performed accurately and consistently across health care institutions and could help mitigate strained resources in the escalating COVID-19 pandemic."
257,Comparison of Tracheal vs Nasopharyngeal Secretions for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Testing in Patients With Tracheostomy.,"This study compares nasopharyngeal and tracheal samples for COVID-19 viral testing in patients with a tracheostomy. This was a prospective cohort study done at 2 academic hospitals between March and June 2020. Patients admitted through the emergency department who had a COVID-19 test and an existing tracheostomy or underwent a tracheostomy during the admission period were included. Patients with a positive initial nasopharyngeal swab were placed in the experimental group (n = 8), while those with a negative swab were the control group (n = 7). Nasopharyngeal and tracheal samples underwent COVID-19 testing using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay. Fourteen patients underwent tracheostomy, and 1 had an existing tracheostomy. The average duration of viral shedding in nasopharyngeal samples was 20.9 days. One patient (6.7%) tested positive in tracheal secretions after a negative nasopharyngeal swab. In the remaining patients (93.3%), the nasopharyngeal and tracheal specimens correlated."
258,Development and clinical evaluation of a rapid antibody lateral flow assay for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has quickly spread worldwide since its outbreak in December 2019. One of the primary measures for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an accurate assay for its diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR kits suffer from some limitations, including false-negative results in the clinic. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of a rapid antibody test kit for COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: The nuclear capsid protein (N) and spike protein 1 (S1) fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and rapid antibody-based tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were developed. To evaluate their clinical applications, the serum from COVID-19 patients, suspected COVID-19 patients, recovering COVID-19 patients, patients with general fever or pulmonary infection, doctors and nurses who worked at the fever clinic, and health professionals was analyzed by the rapid antibody test kits. The serum from patients infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and patients with respiratory tract infection was further analyzed to test its cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens. Results: A 47 kDa N protein and 67 kDa S1 fragment of SARS-CoV-2 were successfully expressed, purified, and renatured. The rapid antibody test with recombinant N protein showed higher positive rate than the rapid IgM antibody test with recombinant S1 protein. Clinical evaluation showed that the rapid antibody test kit with recombinant N protein had 88.56 % analytical sensitivity and 97.42 % specificity for COVID-19 patients, 53.48 % positive rate for suspected COVID-19 patients, 57.14 % positive rate for recovering COVID-19 patients, and 0.5-0.8 % cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens. The analytical sensitivity of the kit did not significantly differ in COVID-19 patients with different disease courses (p < 0.01). Conclusions: The rapid antibody test kit with recombinant N protein has high specificity and analytical sensitivity, and can be used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with RT-PCR."
259,"Poor sensitivity of ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-PCR kit (Bioneer, South Korea)"".","Background: Several molecular kits are available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, mostly lacking of proper clinical evaluation due to the emergency caused by COVID19 pandemia, particularly at developing countries like Ecuador. Objective: We carried out an evaluation of the clinical performance of ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR kit"" (Bioneer, South Korea) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using 2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit (IDT, USA) as a gold standard. Results: 48 clinical specimens were included on the study, 38 tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and 10 SARS-CoV-2 negative for 2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit. For ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR kit"", only 30 were SARS-CoV-2 positive, indicating a low clinical performance with sensitivity of 78.9%. Moreover, the limit of detection for ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR kit"" was estimated to be higher than 40,000 viral RNA copies/mL of sample. Conclusions: Proper clinical performance evaluation studies from government agencies at developing countries should be mandatory prior to clinical use authorization of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis kits, particularly when those kits lack of either FDA or its country of origin clinical use authorization, to prevent the distribution of low quality products that may have a negative impact of COVID19 surveillance at developing countries."
