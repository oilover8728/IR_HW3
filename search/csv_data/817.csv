8160,Opportunities and challenges to the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapies for COVID-19.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a substantial global public healthcare crisis, leading to the urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are a potential treatment for COVID-19. This article provides a brief overview of the targets and development of nAbs against COVID-19, and it examines the efficacy of nAbs as part of both outpatient and inpatient treatments based on emerging clinical trial data. Assessment of several promising candidates in clinical trials highlights the potential of nAbs to be an effective therapeutic to treat COVID-19 in outpatient settings. Nevertheless, the efficacy of nAbs treatment for hospitalized patients varies. In addition, this review identifies challenges to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, including concerns over nAbs development and clinical use. Resistant variants significantly threaten the availability of nAb-based therapeutics. This review also discusses other approaches that may improve the clinical benefit of neutralizing mAbs."
8161,Early experience with universal preoperative and pre-procedural screening for COVID-19 in low-risk pediatric surgical patients requiring general anesthesia.,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed extraordinary demands on healthcare services worldwide. Some have reported increased viral transmission to healthcare workers during aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation. We report our experience with universal preoperative and preprocedural screening for COVID-19 in children requiring general anaesthesia with low risk of having the infection. Methods: This was a data review involving children aged < 18 years undergoing procedures under general anaesthesia in our institution from 18th March to 31st May 2020 and deemed low risk for COVID 19 infection, as defined by our institutional protocol. Confirmation of COVID-19 was by real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing. All patients were followed up 14 days post-swab. Results: Of the 66 children (median age 4.5 years, range 0-16.8) eligible for the study, 39 (60%) were male and infants (1-12 months) formed the largest group (n = 24, 36%). None were positive for COVID-19. On 14 day follow-up, none had symptoms related to COVID-19. Conclusion: Our study shows that low risk asymptomatic children with no history of contact with COVID-19 patients test negative on universal screening. Larger studies are required to ascertain the role of screening prior to procedures done under general anaesthesia."
8162,A novel highly quantitative and reproducible assay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies.,"The quantitative range and reproducibility of current serological tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not optimized. Herein, we developed a diagnostic test that detects SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM with high quantitativeness and reproducibility and low interference. The system was based on the high-sensitivity chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (HISCL) platform and detects IgG and IgM specific to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. Quantification accuracy and reproducibility were evaluated using serially diluted samples from 60 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Assay performance was evaluated using serum samples from the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and 500 SARS-CoV-2-negative serum samples collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. The system showed high quantification accuracy (range, 102), high reproducibility (within 5%), and no cross-reaction between SARS1- and MERS-S proteins. Detection accuracy was 98.3% and 93.3% for IgG and IgM against spike proteins and 100% and 71.7% for IgG and IgM against nucleocapsid proteins, respectively. Mean antibody levels were > 10 times that in negative samples upon admission and > 100 times that at convalescent periods. Clinical severity upon admission was not correlated with IgG or IgM levels. This highly quantitative, reproducible assay system with high clinical performance may help analyze temporal serological/immunological profiles of SARS-CoV-2 infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness."
8163,"[Analysis of pathogenesis, syndrome differentiation and treatment of asymptomatic infectors of coronavirus disease 2019 based on the theory of ""pathogen hiding in the pleurodiaphragmatic interspace""].","Among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), compared with the symptomatic infection patients, 2019-nCoV carried by asymptomatic infection patients are more likely to be widely spread due to secrecy and neglect, thus brings severe challenges to the current prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The therapies of asymptomatic 2019-nCoV infection are still in research. Through excavating the Chinese medical classics, it was found that the theory of ""pathogen hiding in the pleurodiaphragmatic interspace"", with its unique syndrome differentiation system and curative effect of treating symptoms and causes, can provide clinical reference for the treatment of asymptomatic 2019-nCoV infections and provide theoretical basis traditional Chinese medicine in the battle against infectious diseases."
8164,Drug repurposing: new strategies for addressing COVID-19 outbreak.,"Introduction: COVID-19 outbreak has infected 34.20 million people with 1019 thousand deaths in more than 125 countries till 30 September 2020. Due to the unavailability of vaccine or targeted novel drug therapy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), screening of existential medical treatments facilitates identification of promising drugs for the treatment and management of COVID-19.Areas covered: The review article highlights repurposing of antiviral, antimalarial, antineoplastic, antidiabetic, analgesic, and immunomodulatory drugs. Furthermore, clinical trials, in-vitro studies, benefits, adverse effects, toxicities, mechanisms of action, and regulatory status of drugs are covered in this article.Expert opinion: Lack of conclusive results from randomized clinical trials indicates absence of specific drugs for treatment of COVID-19. Unavailability of complete data regarding safety, efficacy, and adverse reactions of drugs restricts the recommendation of clinical advice on dose and duration of the drug therapy. Remdesivir and favipiravir show promising outcomes but more clinical evidence is required for use in large populations. Experimental and repurposed drug therapies targeting spike and envelope proteins, Mpro, 3CLpro and PLpro enzymes, and RdRp and TMPRSS2 genes show capability to produce effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 action. Development of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will offer long-term solution to terminate spread of this global pandemic."
8165,Food safety issues related to wildlife have not been taken seriously from SARS to COVID-19.,"17 years after the outbreak of SARS, the 2019-nCoV broke out in December 2019. It's an unprecedented huge challenge and disaster for people all over the world. According to Web of Science database, The author found that 95,724 virology papers have been published in the past 17 years, 68,632 of which are supported by fund (71.7%). Meanwhile, 50,567 papers related to food safety have been published in the past 17 years, 28,165 of which are supported by fund (55.7%%). It seems that people's safety and global stability are greatly guaranteed. However, whether SARS or 2019-nCoV, scientists were targeting wildlife, the author found that only 515 studies on food safety related to wildlife have been published worldwide in the past 17 years. After SARS, the whole world did not pay enough attention to food safety related to wildlife."
8166,Duration of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infectivity: When Is It Safe to Discontinue Isolation?,"Defining the duration of infectivity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has major implications for public health and infection control practice in healthcare facilities. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required 2 negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery, and multiple studies now indicate that these generally do not reflect replication-competent virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be most contagious around the time of symptom onset, and infectivity rapidly decreases thereafter to near-zero after about 10 days in mild-moderately ill patients and 15 days in severely-critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval associated with replication-competent virus thus far is 20 days from symptom onset. This review summarizes evidence-to-date on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and how this has informed evolving public health recommendations on when it is safe to discontinue isolation precautions."
8167,[2020: Evidence-Based Medicine odyssey. The fall and rise of evidence-based medicine in the year of coronavirus.].,"It was a very dark year for EBM. One of the side effects of the Covid-19 pandemic is a severe compression of the evidences. Here are some worrying events. May 2020: the saga of hydroxychloroquine. October 2020: the nitazoxanide case. November 2020: Trump Administration Interferes on Expert Opinion. December 2020: the results of the trials on the first two vaccines were announced in press releases, leaving many scientific uncertainties. Peter Piot, head of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine noted that none of the CoViD-19 vaccines have offered much data to date. «It is frustrating that all of these announcements are delivered via press release, and not give us a chance to review the actual data. We desperately need total transparency on evidence and data», says Piot. Better now to relaunch the spread of EBM. In the issue, we have included the best EBM-based readings from the Club for Evidence-Based in Gastroenterology & Hepatology (ebgh.it)."
8168,A practical approach to imaging characteristics and standardized reporting of COVID-19: a radiologic review.,"Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a pathogen that has caused a rapidly spreading pandemic all over the world. The primary mean of transmission is inhalation with a predilection for respiratory system involvement, especially in the distal airways. The disease that arises from this novel coronavirus is named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 may have a rapid and devastating course in some cases leading to severe complications and death. Radiological imaging methods have an invaluable role in diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. In this review, radiological imaging findings of COVID-19 have been systematically reviewed based on the published literature so far. Radiologic reporting templates are also emphasized from a different point of view, considering specific distinctive patterns of involvement."
8169,Coronaviruses: What Should We Know About the Characteristics of Viruses?,"The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious and fatal, posing a direct threat to human health and the global economy. Most strategies to prevent, control, and eradicate COVID-19 are established based on the specific characteristics of the pathogen. The quest for interruption and eradication of COVID-19 has moved research forward in understanding fundamental aspects of the virus genome, proteome, replication mechanisms, and virus-host interactions, which pave the way for the development of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines. This chapter provides an overview of recent progress in human coronavirus taxonomy, molecular features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and proteome, and virus life cycle."
