130,Diagnostic Testing for COVID-19: Systematic Review of Meta-Analyses and Evidence-Based Algorithms.,"Background: Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), a disease caused by infection with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic. Diagnosis is critical and diagnostic techniques include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serologic antibody testing, and chest computed tomography (CT). Despite rigorous meta-analyses looking into these techniques, there is no summary and additionally no algorithm to help guide diagnostic testing. Our objective is to perform a systematic review of the literature and to provide evidence-based algorithms for diagnosing or ruling out COVID-19. Methods: Data were gathered using PubMed and Ovid research databases using a predefined medical subject heading (MeSH) based search, and sources that were included in the study had their references reviewed to screen for more sources for this study. Sources were collected up to 23 August 2020. Two researchers searched through the databases for articles and data/articles meeting inclusion criteria were extracted. Results: 395 articles were identified, and 10 studies were included. Meta-analyses of diagnostic tests were included in our systematic review. An overview was then provided for each diagnostic test. Sensitivities and specificities for RT-PCR, serologic antibody tests and chest CT were collected, and the data was stratified by categorical variables. Two evidence-based algorithms were developed for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the hospitalized and ambulatory settings. Conclusions: This article provides a summary of the up-to-date efficacy of the most utilized diagnostic tests currently available for COVID-19. Additionally, this article provides evidence-based COVID-19 diagnostic algorithms for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the hospitalized and ambulatory settings."
131,Validation of the COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Virus on Stainless-Steel Surfaces: AOAC Performance Tested MethodSM 122004.,"Background: The COVID-19 Indoor Test™ by Phylagen uses a real-time PCR Assay to detect nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, which is extracted from swabs sampled from environmental surfaces. This information can be used to detect the presence of the virus in indoor environments. Objective: To validate the COVID-19 Indoor TestTM by Phylagen as part of the AOAC Research Institute's Emergency Response Validation Performance Tested Method(s)SM program. Method: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen assay was evaluated for specificity using in silico analysis of 15 764 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and 65 exclusivity organisms. The candidate method was also evaluated in an unpaired matrix study design for one environmental surface (stainless steel) and compared to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Revision 4, Effective 6/12/2020). Results: Results of the in silico analysis demonstrated the specificity of the method in being able to detect SARS-CoV-2 target sequences and discriminate them from near-neighbors. In the matrix study, the candidate method demonstrated statistically significant better recovery of the target analyte than the reference method (2 × 103 GU/2 × 2"" test surface). Conclusions: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen is a rapid and accurate method that can be utilized to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, on stainless-steel surfaces in built environments. Highlights: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen assay performed significantly better than the reference method when used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from environmental surfaces."
132,Comparative study of four SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) platforms demonstrates that ID NOW performance is impaired substantially by patient and specimen type.,"The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States created a unique situation where multiple molecular SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays rapidly received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and were validated by laboratories and utilized clinically, all within a period of a few weeks. We compared the performance of four of these assays that were evaluated for use at our institution: Abbott RealTime m2000 SARS-CoV-2 Assay, DiaSorin Simplexa COVID-19 Direct, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, and Abbott ID NOW COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens were collected from 88 ED and hospital-admitted patients and tested by the four methods in parallel to compare performance. ID NOW performance stood out as significantly worse than the other 3 assays despite demonstrating comparable analytic sensitivity. Further study determined that the use of a nasal swab compared to a nylon flocked nasopharyngeal swab, as well as use in a population chronically vs. acutely positive for SARS-CoV-2, were substantial factors."
133,Diagnostic evaluation of qRT-PCR-based kit and dPCR-based kit for COVID-19.,"Background: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is well known as a fatal disease, first discovered at Wuhan in China, ranging from mild to death, such as shortness of breath and fever. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is a crucial point in preventing global prevalence. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic competency and efficiency with the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit and the Dr. PCR 20 K COVID-19 Detection kit, designed based on the qRT-PCR and dPCR technologies, respectively. Methods: A total of 30 negative and 20 COVID-19 positive specimens were assigned to the diagnostic test by using different COVID-19 diagnosis kits. Diagnostic accuracy was measured by statistical testing with sensitivity, specificity, and co-efficiency calculations. Results: Comparing both diagnostic kits, we confirmed that the diagnostic results of 30 negative and 20 positive cases were the same pre-diagnostic results. The diagnostic statistics test results were perfectly matched with value (1). Cohen's Kappa coefficient was demonstrated that the given kits in two different ways were ""almost perfect"" with value (1). In evaluating the detection capability, the dilutional linearity experiments substantiate that the Dr. PCR 20 K COVID-19 Detection kit could detect SARS-CoV-2 viral load at a concentration ten times lower than that of the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit. Conclusions: In this study, we propose that the dPCR diagnosis using LOAA dPCR could be a powerful method for COVID-19 point-of-care tests requiring immediate diagnosis in a limited time and space through the advantages of relatively low sample concentration and small equipment size compared to conventional qRT-PCR."
134,"Orthogonal antibody testing for COVID-19 among healthcare workers in a non-epidemic place and time:Japan's Iwate Prefecture, May 18-31, 2020.","Of the 47 prefectures in Japan, Iwate had the fewest cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first diagnosis officially confirmed on July 28, 2020. A baseline serological survey of COVID-19 antibodies is essential to accurately evaluate an epidemic outbreak. The primary purpose of this study was to determine pre-epidemic prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among healthcare workers, using two laboratory-based quantitative tests. In addition, a point-of-care (POC) qualitative test, rapid, simple, and convenient for primary care clinics, was compared with the laboratory-based tests. All antibody tests were performed on serum from 1,000 healthcare workers (mean age, 40 ± 11 years) in Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital, May 29-31, 2020. A COVID-19 case was defined as showing positive results in both laboratory-based quantitative tests. None of 1,000 samples had positive results in both of the laboratory immunoassays. The POC test showed positive results in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% confidence interval:2.19-4.41), but no samples were simultaneously positive in both laboratory-based tests. In conclusion, COVID-19 cases were not serologically confirmed by a baseline control study of healthcare workers at our hospital in late May, 2020. Moreover, the POC qualitative test may offer no advantage in areas with very low prevalence of COVID-19, due to higher false-positive reactions compared with laboratory-based quantitative immunoassays."
135,"A retrospective analysis of 12,400 SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests in patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan.","The outbreak and widely spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern. COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented and profound impact on the whole world, and the prevention and control of COVID-19 is a global public health challenge remains to be solved. The retrospective analysis of the large scale tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may indicate some important information of this pandemic. We selected 12400 SARS-CoV-2 tests detected in Wuhan in the first semester of 2020 and made a systematic analysis of them, in order to find some beneficial clue for the consistent prevention and control of COVID-19.SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in suspected COVID-19 patients with real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The patients' features including gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, and the dynamic changes of the clinical symptoms were recorded and statistically analyzed. Quantitative and qualitive statistical analysis were carried out after laboratory detection.The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 33.02% in 12,400 suspected patients' specimens in Wuhan at the first months of COVID-19 epidemics. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test of nasopharyngeal swabs might produce 4.79% (594/12400) presumptive results. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was significantly different between gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, respectively (P < .05). The median window period from the occurrence of clinical symptom or close contact with COVID-19 patient to the first detection of positive PCR was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-4 days). The median interval time from the first SARS-CoV-2 positive to the turning negative was 14 days (interquartile range, 8-19.25 days).This study reveals the comprehensive characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from multiple perspectives, and it provides important clues and may also supply useful suggestions for future work of the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."
136,Evaluation of two rapid antigen tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital setting.,"Successful containment strategies for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will depend on reliable diagnostic assays. Point-of-care antigen tests (POCT) may provide an alternative to time-consuming PCR tests to rapidly screen for acute infections on site. Here, we evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests: the STANDARD™ F COVID-19 Ag FIA (FIA) and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). For diagnostic assessment, we used a large set of PCR-positive and PCR-negative respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and health care workers in the setting of two University Hospitals in Munich, Germany, i.e. emergency rooms, patient care units or employee test centers. For FIA, overall clinical sensitivity and specificity were 45.4% (n = 381) and 97.8% (n = 360), respectively, and for RAT, 50.3% (n = 445) and 97.7% (n = 386), respectively. For primary diagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, diagnostic sensitivities were 60.9% (FIA) (n = 189) and 64.5% (RAT) (n = 256). This questions these tests' utility for the reliable detection of acute SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, in particular in high-risk settings. We support the proposal that convincing high-quality outcome data on the impact of false-negative and false-positive antigen test results need to be obtained in a POCT setting. Moreover, the efficacy of alternative testing strategies to complement PCR assays must be evaluated by independent laboratories, prior to widespread implementation in national and international test strategies."
137,CT scan chest findings in symptomatic COVID-19 patients: a reliable alternative for diagnosis.,"Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 pneumonia shows typical CT Scan features which can aid diagnoses and therefore help in the early detection and isolation of infected patients. CT scanners are readily available in many parts of Ghana. It is able to show findings typical for COVID-19 infection of the chest, even in instances where Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) misses the diagnosis. Little is known about the diagnostic potential of chest CT scan and COVID-19 among physicians even though CT scan offers a high diagnostic accuracy."
138,Comparing two sample pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection for efficient screening of COVID-19.,"The emerging pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 200 countries and resulted in a shortage of diagnostic resources globally. Rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital to control the spreading of the disease, which, however, is challenged by limited detection capacity and low detection efficiency in many parts of the world. The pooling test may offer an economical and effective approach to increase the virus testing capacity of medical laboratories without requiring more laboratory resources such as laboratory workers, testing reagents, and equipment. In this study, the sample pools of 6 and 10 were detected by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay targeting ORF1ab and N genes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Each pool consisted of five or nine negative SARS-CoV-2 samples and one positive counterpart with varying viral loads. Two different strategies of sample pooling were investigated and the results were compared comprehensively. One approach was to pool the viral transport medium of the samples in the laboratory, and the other was to pool swab samples during the collection process. For swab pooling strategy, qualitative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, specific tests of ORF1ab and N genes, remained stable over the different pool sizes. Together, this study demonstrates that the swab pooling strategy may serve as an effective and economical approach for screening SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations, especially in countries and regions where medical resources are limited during the pandemic and may thus be potential for clinical laboratory applications."
139,Performance assessment of 11 commercial serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 on hospitalised COVID-19 patients.,"Background: Commercial availability of serological tests to evaluate immunoglobulins (Ig) targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has grown exponentially since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Thorough validation of these tests is important before use as epidemiological tools to infer seroprevalence in specific populations and as diagnostic tools to complement molecular approaches (e.g., quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). Methods: Commercial serological tests from 11 suppliers were assayed side-by-side using 126 samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected inpatients and 36 from healthy and HIV-infected individuals. Results: The majority of the tests assayed have >95% specificity. For the sensitivity calculation, samples were stratified by days since symptoms onset; sensitivity peaks at 16-21 days for IgM and IgA (maximum 91.2%, Euroimmun) and, dependant on the test, at 16-21 or >21 days for IgG (maximum 94.1%, Snibe). Data from semiquantitative tests show that patients with a severe clinical presentation have lower levels of Ig targeting SARS-CoV-2 at <10 days since symptoms onset and higher levels at >21 days, compared to patients with a non-severe presentation. Conclusions: This study highlights the heterogeneity of sensitivity and generally high specificity of the serological tests and establishes a basis for their usefulness to complement diagnostic techniques and population seroprevalence studies."
