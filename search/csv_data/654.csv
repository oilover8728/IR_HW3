6530,The Missing Link in the Covid-19 Vaccine Race.,"Operation Warp Speed and global vaccine research efforts have succeeded in rapidly launching three vaccine candidates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into Phase III clinical trials. A recent letter from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Redfield underscored the possibility of ""large-scale"" distribution of a coronavirus vaccine as early as November 1, 2020. However, recent polling reveals that the majority of Americans remain skeptical of both the safety and efficacy of a potential Covid-19 vaccine. Even more troublesome is the fact that a comprehensive, collaborative vaccine marketing campaign has not been initiated to educate the U.S. public on and encourage widespread Covid-19 vaccination. Accordingly, this article lays out a plan of action, utilizing proven immunization marketing strategies and novel approaches, that could be used to combat vaccine hesitancy toward Covid-19. A vaccine may indeed be our ticket out of this pandemic, but targeted marketing is needed to increase public optimism toward that fact."
6531,Laboratory medicine: The exemplar for value-based healthcare.,"Value-Based Healthcare (VBHC) aims to improve the overall quality, safety, and sustainability of healthcare while reducing delivery costs of more effective care. Despite advantages associated with VBHC transformation, the road to its adoption has been lengthy. Laboratory Medicine (LM) is in a prime position to lead the transition to VBHC because of its key role in diagnosis and treatment of patients. Laboratory medicine results inform/influence 50% to 70% of all clinical decisions. This article summarizes some issues associated with adoption of VBHC and related healthcare innovations and suggests potential approaches using LM-specific examples to help accelerate adoption. Laboratory medicine is both a useful model for VBHC implementation and facilitator for related innovation adoption by helping to target patient populations that would benefit most from specific interventions. The critical value of rapidly adopted diagnostic technologies used during the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recovery provide important insights about the need to embrace and accelerate VBHC implementation."
6532,Comprehensive overview of COVID-19 based on current evidence.,"In December 2019, twenty-seven pneumonia patients with unknown causes originated in South China seafood market in Wuhan. The virus infection spread rapidly and swept through China in less than a month. Subsequently, the virus was proven a novel coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of novel coronavirus has been determined as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on January 31, 2020. Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous. Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow. Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas. In this article, we compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, discussed current researching progress of COVID-19, including clinical characteristics, pathological changes, treatment measures, and so on."
6533,Recent Hydroxychloroquine Use Is Not Significantly Associated with Positive PCR Results for SARS-CoV-2: A Nationwide Observational Study in South Korea.,"Background: To evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as pre-exposure prophylaxis against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we investigated the prevalence of positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing according to recent HCQ use in patients who had been tested using nationwide health-insurance data of South Korea. Methods: All adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 from 20 January 2020 to 15 May 2020 were identified. HCQ users were defined as patients who had been pretreated with HCQ for at least 30 days until the date of SARS-CoV-2 testing. The prevalence of positive PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 was compared between HCQ users and nonusers. Results: Of a total of 216,686 individuals who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, 743 (0.3%) were pretreated with HCQ. The prevalence of positive results was not significantly different between HCQ users (2.2%) and nonusers (2.7%; P = 0.35), with an odds ratio of 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.48-1.30). Propensity score-matched-cohort analysis showed similar results in terms of the prevalence of positive results (2.2% in HCQ users vs. 3.1% in nonusers; P = 0.18), with an odds ratio of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.40-1.19). The rate of positive PCR was not significantly different in long-term HCQ users (more than 3 or 6 months) compared with nonusers. Conclusions: In this population-based study, recent exposure to HCQ was not significantly associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data do not support the use of HCQ as pre-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19."
6534,Zoonotic and Reverse Zoonotic Transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the first known pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), appears to be capable of infecting different mammalian species. Recent detections of this virus in pet, zoo, wild, and farm animals have compelled inquiry regarding the zoonotic (animal-to-human) and reverse zoonotic (human-to-animal) transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of COVID-19 pandemic evolving into a panzootic. It is important to monitor the global spread of disease and to assess the significance of genomic changes to support prevention and control efforts during a pandemic. An understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology provides opportunities to prevent the risk of repeated re-infection of humans and requires a robust One Health-based investigation. This review paper describes the known properties and the existing gaps in scientific knowledge about the zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmissibility of the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease it causes."

6536,Therapeutic Potential of Metformin in COVID-19: Reasoning for Its Protective Role.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections present with increased disease severity and poor clinical outcomes in diabetic patients compared with their nondiabetic counterparts. Diabetes/hyperglycemia-triggered endothelial dysfunction and hyperactive inflammatory and immune responses are correlated to twofold to threefold higher intensive care hospitalizations and more than twice the mortality among diabetic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. While comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension worsen the prognosis of diabetic COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 infections are also associated with new-onset diabetes, severe metabolic complications, and increased thrombotic events in the backdrop of aberrant endothelial function. While several antidiabetic medications are used to manage blood glucose levels, we discuss the multifaceted ability of metformin to control blood glucose levels and possibly attenuate endothelial dysfunction, inhibit viral entry and infection, and modify inflammatory and immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infections. These actions make metformin a viable candidate drug to be considered for repurposing and gaining ground against the SARS-CoV-2-induced tsunami in diabetic COVID-19 patients."

6539,What we know and dont know on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has had an enormous impact on public health worldwide due to its rapid spread and pandemic behavior, challenges in its control and mitigation, and few therapeutic alternatives. In this review, we summarize the pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical presentation, and diagnostic techniques. In addition, the main lineages and the different strategies for disease prevention are reviewed, with emphasis on the development of vaccines and their different platforms. Finally, some of the currently available therapeutic strategies are summarized. Throughout the article, we point out the current knowns and unknowns at the time of writing this article."
