7520,OUTBREAK of novel corona virus disease (COVID-19): Antecedence and aftermath.,"Outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in mid of December 2019 and spread very rapidly across the globe within a month of its outbreak. Researchers all across the globe started working to find out its possible treatments. However, most of initiatives taken were based on various hypotheses and till date no successful treatments have been achieved. Some strategies adopted by China where existing antiviral therapy was initially used to treat COVID-19 have not given very successful results. Researchers from Thailand explored the use of combination of anti-influenza drugs such as Oseltamivir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir to treat it. In some cases, combination therapy of antiviral drugs with chloroquine showed better action against COVID-19. Some of the clinical studies showed very good effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19, however, they were not recommended due to serious clinical toxicity. In some cases, use of rho kinase inhibitor, fasudil was found very effective. In some of the countries, antibody-based therapies have proved fairly successful. The use of BCG vaccines came in light; however, they were not found successful due to lack of full-proof mechanistic studies. In Israel as well as in other developed countries, pluristems allogeneic placental expanded cell therapy has been found successful. Some phytochemicals and nutraceuticals have also been explored to treat it. In a recent report, the use of dexamethasone was found very effective in patients suffering from COVID-19. Its effect was most striking among patients on ventilator. The research for vaccines that can prevent the disease is still going on. In light of the dynamic trends, present review focuses on etiopathogenesis, factors associated with spreading of the virus, and possible strategies to treat this deadly infection. In addition, it attempts to compile the recent updates on development of drugs and vaccines for the dreaded disease."
7521,Machine learning application for the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 infection using blood tests and chest radiograph.,"Triaging and prioritising patients for RT-PCR test had been essential in the management of COVID-19 in resource-scarce countries. In this study, we applied machine learning (ML) to the task of detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection using basic laboratory markers. We performed the statistical analysis and trained an ML model on a retrospective cohort of 5148 patients from 24 hospitals in Hong Kong to classify COVID-19 and other aetiology of pneumonia. We validated the model on three temporal validation sets from different waves of infection in Hong Kong. For predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection, the ML model achieved high AUCs and specificity but low sensitivity in all three validation sets (AUC: 89.9-95.8%; Sensitivity: 55.5-77.8%; Specificity: 91.5-98.3%). When used in adjunction with radiologist interpretations of chest radiographs, the sensitivity was over 90% while keeping moderate specificity. Our study showed that machine learning model based on readily available laboratory markers could achieve high accuracy in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection."
7522,A main event and multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 initiated the COVID-19 epidemic in Greece.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Chains of infections starting from various countries worldwide seeded the outbreak of COVID-19 in Athens, capital city of Greece. A full-genome analysis of isolates from Athens' hospitals and other healthcare providers revealed the variety of SARS-CoV-2 that initiated the pandemic before lockdown and passenger flight restrictions. A dominant variant, encompassing the G614D amino acid substitution, spread through a major virus dispersal event, and sporadic introductions of rare variants characterized the local initiation of the epidemic. Mutations within the genome highlighted the genetic drift of the virus as rare variants emerged. An important variant contained a premature stop codon in orf7a leading to the truncation of a possibly important for viral pathogenesis domain. This study may serve as a reference for resolving future lines of infection in the area, especially after resumption of passenger flight connections to Athens and Greece during summer of 2020."
7523,[Quadruple negative SARS-CoV-2-PCR: still COVID-19 pneumonia!].,"Medical history and clinical findings: A 78-year-old man fell ill with weakness, coughing and fever 19 days after a cruise in early April 2020 and was admitted 4 days later with increasing shortness of breath. Examination and diagnosis: On admission, the patient had subfebrile temperatures, exercise dyspnea, and right-basal rales. CRP was moderately elevated and oxygen saturation was slightly reduced. Thoracic CT showed bilateral ground-glass infiltrates. Immediately after the cruise a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Therapy and course: Due to the fact that the patient's asymptomatic wife had been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 immediately after returning from the cruise, we suspected COVID-19 disease and admitted the patient to our isolation ward. Two nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchial lavage yielded negative results for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, suspected COVID-19 diagnosis was verified serologically. Conclusion: In case of a high degree of clinical suspicion in combination with typical findings of thoracic imaging, the suspected diagnosis COVID-19 disease should be maintained even in case of multiple negative SARS-CoV-2-PCR. Seroconversion occurs a few days to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms and can be used to confirm the diagnosis."
7524,Valinomycin as a potential antiviral agent against coronaviruses: A review.,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been resulting in global epidemics with heavy morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there are currently no specific medicines that can better treat these coronaviruses. Drug repurposing is an effective and economical strategy for drug discovery from existing drugs, natural products, and synthetic compounds. In this review, the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of valinomycin (VAL), especially its activity against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), were summarized, it highlights that VAL has tremendous potential for use as a novel antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2."
7525,Clinical usefulness of fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassay for quantitative antibody measurements in COVID-19 patients.,"Since December 2019, we have been in the battlefield with a new threat to the humanity, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), characterized by viral pneumonia. It may be asymptomatic or cause various symptoms, ranging from flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death. At present, the only reliable test for COVID-19 diagnosis is quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Assessing the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 could increase the detection sensitivity of infected population. Hereby, we report the performances of a fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) on 276 serum samples. One hundred samples obtained from COVID-19 negative subjects (COVID-19 free) were analyzed to evaluate the diagnostic specificity of antibody (Ab) detection. Thereafter, 176 samples obtained from 125 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-19 patients) were selected to assess the diagnostic sensitivity of the CLIA. All samples were analyzed on MAGLUMI 800 platform. All COVID-19 free samples had Ab levels below the cutoff values. Hence, the diagnostic specificity was estimated at 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 96.3-100.0; positive predictive value = 100%). By the 18th day from the onset of symptoms, we reached an optimal diagnostic sensitivity (more than 95.0%) In fact, the diagnostic sensitivity increased over time and between 15 and 25 days after symptoms onset, reached 95.5% (95% CI = 84.9-99.2). The new automated CLIA analyzer appeared to be a robust and reliable method to measure specific Ab against COVID-19 at high throughput. Our data suggest that combining Ab and nucleic acid detection could increase diagnostic sensitivity."

7527,The use of convalescent plasma for pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2: A systematic literature review.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a severe illness leading to pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death. With this study, we performed a systematic review of the literature and ongoing clinical trials on convalescent plasma therapy in pediatric patients with COVID-19. The electronic databases Medline PubMed, Scopus, and Web Of Science were searched. Also, clinical trials registries were searched for potentially eligible studies. A total of 90 records were retrieved after duplicate removal. Eight studies were case reports of children treated with convalescent plasma therapy (14 children, age range, 9 weeks to 18 years); 5 children had a chronic disease. During the hospital stay, 5 received drugs (e.g., remdesivir) in addition to convalescent plasma therapy. No convalescent plasma therapy-related adverse events were reported in 5 studies and 3 made no mention of adverse events. Seven studies concluded that convalescent plasma therapy is or could be a useful therapeutic option; one study made no claims. Only 3 of the 13 retrieved trials underway were planned exclusively for children. This is the first systematic review of the literature regarding convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 in children. We found insufficient clinical information on the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in children. Nevertheless, the positive outcomes of the few case reports published to date suggest that convalescent plasma therapy may be of potential benefit. Further research with well-designed and powered clinical trials is needed."

7529,Consecutive false-negative rRT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 in patients after clinical recovery from COVID-19.,"This study reviewed the serial real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results of 37 patients admitted to our hospital in Wuhan, China, who had three or more sequential negative results before discharge. Of these 37 patients, 14 (~38%) had a positive rRT-PCR result after a negative result during convalescence, and 5 (~14%) had a positive rRT-PCR result after two consecutive negative results during convalescence. These results suggest that it may be necessary to require that patients have three consecutive negative results before discharge, to ensure that they do not spread infection among members of their household, or in the community. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it is not currently the standard of care to require patients to have three consecutive negative results before discharge. Our results suggest that a relatively high proportion of patients may continue to shed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 after they have clinically recovered, and thus may transmit the infection to others."
