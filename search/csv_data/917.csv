9160,COVID-19 and the human innate immune system.,"The introduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the human population represents a tremendous medical and economic crisis. Innate immunity-as the first line of defense of our immune system-plays a central role in combating this novel virus. Here, we provide a conceptual framework for the interaction of the human innate immune system with SARS-CoV-2 to link the clinical observations with experimental findings that have been made during the first year of the pandemic. We review evidence that variability in innate immune system components among humans is a main contributor to the heterogeneous disease courses observed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease spectrum induced by SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms observed for cells and soluble mediators involved in innate immunity is a prerequisite for the development of diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies targeting COVID-19. However, this will also require additional studies addressing causality of events, which so far are lagging behind."
9161,[Neuroimmunology of COVID-19].,"Many neuroimmunological diseases, such as encephalopathy, encephalitis, myelitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) have occurred more frequently after infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which indicates a parainfectious or postinfectious association. The most likely underlying mechanisms include virus-triggered overactivation of the immune system with hyperinflammation and cytokine storm but potentially also the development of specific autoantibodies against central nervous system (CNS) tissue. These were predominantly detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In contrast, direct damage after invasion of SARS-CoV‑2 into the brain and spinal cord does not seem to play a relevant role. Susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV‑2 in patients with multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or other neuroimmunological diseases including the risk for severe disease courses, is not determined by the administered immunotherapy but by known risk factors, such as age, comorbidities and the disease-related degree of disability. Therefore, immunotherapy in these patients should not be delayed or discontinued. The contribution of neuroimmunological mechanisms to long-term sequelae after survival of a COVID-19 illness, such as fatigue, impairment of memory, sleep dysfunction or anxiety, will require long-term clinical follow-up, preferentially in COVID-19 register studies."
9162,Ubiquitin-Modified Proteome of SARS-CoV-2-Infected Host Cells Reveals Insights into Virus-Host Interaction and Pathogenesis.,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a serious threat to global public health. The mechanism of pathogenesis and the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are largely unknown. In the present study, we applied a quantitative proteomic technology to identify and quantify the ubiquitination changes that occur in both the virus and the Vero E6 cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. By applying label-free, quantitative liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry proteomics, 8943 lysine ubiquitination sites on 3086 proteins were identified, of which 138 sites on 104 proteins were quantified as significantly upregulated, while 828 sites on 447 proteins were downregulated at 72 h post-infection. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection might modulate host immune responses through the ubiquitination of important proteins, including USP5, IQGAP1, TRIM28, and Hsp90. Ubiquitination modification was also observed on 11 SAR-CoV-2 proteins, including proteins involved in virus replication and inhibition of the host innate immune response. Our study provides new insights into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the host as well as potential targets for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."
9163,Will children reveal their secret? The coronavirus dilemma.,"Epidemiological evidences show that SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less frequent and severe than adults. Age-related ACE2 receptor expression, lymphocyte count and trained immunity might be the keystone to reveal children's secret."

9165,Analytical validity of nanopore sequencing for rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis.,"Viral whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides critical insight into the transmission and evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Long-read sequencing devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) promise significant improvements in turnaround time, portability and cost, compared to established short-read sequencing platforms for viral WGS (e.g., Illumina). However, adoption of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been limited due to common concerns around sequencing accuracy. To address this, here we perform viral WGS with ONT and Illumina platforms on 157 matched SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, enabling rigorous evaluation of analytical performance. We report that, despite the elevated error rates observed in ONT sequencing reads, highly accurate consensus-level sequence determination was achieved, with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected at >99% sensitivity and >99% precision above a minimum ~60-fold coverage depth, thereby ensuring suitability for SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis. ONT sequencing also identified a surprising diversity of structural variation within SARS-CoV-2 specimens that were supported by evidence from short-read sequencing on matched samples. However, ONT sequencing failed to accurately detect short indels and variants at low read-count frequencies. This systematic evaluation of analytical performance for SARS-CoV-2 WGS will facilitate widespread adoption of ONT sequencing within local, national and international COVID-19 public health initiatives."
9166,"Multiple sites on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are susceptible to proteolysis by cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V.","SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Proteases are central to the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of the spike protein on the virus's capsid causes the conformational change that leads to membrane fusion and viral entry into the target cell. Since inhibition of one protease, even the dominant protease like TMPRSS2, may not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, other proteases that may play an activating role and hydrolyze the spike protein must be identified. We identified amino acid sequences in all regions of spike protein, including the S1/S2 region critical for activation and viral entry, that are susceptible to cleavage by furin and cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V using PACMANS, a computational platform that identifies and ranks preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage on substrates, and verified with molecular docking analysis and immunoblotting to determine if binding of these proteases can occur on the spike protein that were identified as possible cleavage sites. Together, this study highlights cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V for consideration in SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents methodologies by which other proteases can be screened to determine a role in viral entry. This highlights additional proteases to be considered in COVID-19 studies, particularly regarding exacerbated damage in inflammatory preconditions where these proteases are generally upregulated."
9167,Generalized linear models provide a measure of virulence for specific mutations in SARS-CoV-2 strains.,"This study aims to highlight SARS-COV-2 mutations which are associated with increased or decreased viral virulence. We utilize genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries' regional information, such as deaths and cases per million, as well as COVID-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein."
9168,A SARS-CoV-2 -human metalloproteome interaction map.,"The recent pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus resulted in the greatest global health crisis since the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. There is limited knowledge of whether SARS-CoV-2 is physically associated with human metalloproteins. Recently, high-confidence, experimentally supported protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins were reported. In this work, 58 metalloproteins among these human targets have been identified by a structure-based approach. This study reveals that most human metalloproteins interact with the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein, whose antibodies are one of the principal markers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, this work provides sufficient evidence to conclude that Zn2+ plays an important role in the interplay between the novel coronavirus and humans. First, the content of Zn-binding proteins in the involved human metalloproteome is significantly higher than that of the other metal ions. Second, a molecular linkage between the identified human Zn-binding proteome with underlying medical conditions, that might increase the risk of severe illness from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been found. Likely perturbations of host cellular metal homeostasis by SARS-CoV-2 infection are highlighted."
9169,COVID-19 emergency in the cruise's ship: a case report of conjunctivitis.,"Little is known about the Covid-19 transmission through ocular tissue, and more research needs to be carried out in order to confirm its ability to infect ocular tissue and its pathogenic mechanisms. Covid-19 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in novel coronavirus pneumonia patients with conjunctivitis. This case report shows a severe viral conjunctivitis in a patient diagnosed with Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess ship, characterized by both red, irritated and swollen eyes, with transparent serous secretions, conjunctival chemosis, pseudomembranes of fibrin and inflammatory cells on the tarsal conjunctiva accompanied by preauricular lymph nodes and enlarged submaxillaries."
