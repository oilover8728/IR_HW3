1311,Impact of on-site compared to off-site testing for severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on duration of isolation and resource utilization.,"Rapid detection and isolation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is the only means of reducing hospital transmission. We describe the impact of implementation of on-site severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on reducing turnaround time, isolation duration, pathology test ordering, and antibiotic use in patients who do not have COVID-19."
1312,"COVID-19 diagnostics for resource-limited settings: Evaluation of ""unextracted"" qRT-PCR.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a precipitous increase in the need for molecular diagnostics. Unfortunately, access to RNA extraction reagents can represent a bottleneck for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based methodologies, stemming from both extraordinary supply-chain stresses and the global reach of the virus into resource-limited settings. To provide flexible diagnostic options for such environments, we report here an ""unextracted modification"" for qRT-PCR using the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) widely utilized primers/probe sets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (N1/N2/N3 targeting viral nucleocapsid and RP-control targeting human RNase P). This approach replaces RNA extraction/purification with a heat-inactivation step of viral transport media (VTM), followed by direct inoculation-with or without VTM spin concentration-into PCR master mixes. Using derivatives of care from our clinical workflow, we compared traditional and unextracted CDC methodologies. Although some decrease in analytic sensitivity was evident (by higher Ct values) without extraction, in particular for the N2 primer/probe-set, we observed high categorical positive agreement between extracted and unextracted results for N1 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-39/41), N3 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-41/41), and RP (unconcentrated and concentrated VTM-81/81). The negative categorical agreement for N1/N2/N3 was likewise high. Overall, these results suggest that laboratories could adapt and validate unextracted qRT-PCR protocols as a contingency to overcome supply limitations, with minimal impact on categorical results."
1313,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates in rapid development.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still spreading globally. The scientific community is attempting to procure an effective treatment and prevention strategy for COVID-19. A rising number of vaccines for COVID-19 are being developed at an unprecedented speed. Development platforms include traditional inactivated or live attenuated virus vaccines, DNA or RNA vaccines, recombinant viral vector vaccines, and protein or peptide subunit vaccines. There are 23 vaccines in the clinical evaluation stage and at least 140 candidate vaccines in preclinical evaluation. In this review, we describe research regarding basic knowledge on the virus, updates on the animal models, current landscape of vaccines in clinical evaluation and updated research results on vaccine development. Safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines require further investigation."
1314,Rapid Real-time Tracking of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions and Their Association With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Positivity: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic Pulse Study.,"Background: Current mitigation strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rely on the population-wide adoption of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Monitoring the adoption of NPIs and their associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection history can provide key information for public health. Methods: We sampled 1030 individuals in Maryland from 17-28 June 2020 to capture sociodemographically and geographically resolved information about NPI adoption and access to SARS-CoV-2 testing, and examine associations with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Results: Overall, 92% reported traveling for essential services and 66% visited friends/family. Use of public transport was reported by 18%. In total, 68% reported strict social distancing indoors and 53% reported strict masking indoors; indoor social distancing was significantly associated with age, and race/ethnicity and income were associated with masking. Overall, 55 participants (5.3%) self-reported ever testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, with strong dose-response relationships between several forms of movement frequency and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. In a multivariable analysis, a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was negatively associated with strict social distancing (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for outdoor social distancing, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, .03-.33). Only public transport use (aOR for >7 times vs never, 4.3) and visiting a place of worship (aOR for ≥3 times vs never, 16.0) remained significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after adjusting for strict social distancing and demographics. Conclusions: These results support public health messaging that strict social distancing during most activities can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Additional considerations are needed for indoor activities with large numbers of persons (places of worship and public transportation), where even NPIs may not be possible or sufficient."

Design: Diagnostic accuracy study. Setting: Laboratory analyses were performed in the United Kingdom at Imperial College, London and university facilities in London. Research clinics for finger prick sampling were run in two affiliated NHS trusts. Participants: Sensitivity analyses were performed on sera stored from 320 previous participants in the React 2 programme with confirmed previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Specificity analyses were performed on 1000 prepandemic serum samples. 100 new participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection attended study clinics for finger prick testing. Interventions: Laboratory sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed for seven LFIAs on a minimum of 200 serum samples from participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 500 prepandemic serum samples, respectively. Three LFIAs were found to have a laboratory sensitivity superior to the finger prick sensitivity of the LFIA currently used in React 2 seroprevalence studies (84%). These LFIAs were then further evaluated through finger prick testing on participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection: two LFIAs (Surescreen, Panbio) were evaluated in clinics in June-July 2020 and the third LFIA (AbC-19) in September 2020. A spike protein enzyme linked immunoassay and hybrid double antigen binding assay were used as laboratory reference standards. Main outcome measures: The accuracy of LFIAs in detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 compared with two reference standards. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of seven new LFIAs that were analysed using sera varied from 69% to 100%, and from 98.6% to 100%, respectively (compared with the two reference standards). Sensitivity on finger prick testing was 77% (95% confidence interval 61.4% to 88.2%) for Panbio, 86% (72.7% to 94.8%) for Surescreen, and 69% (53.8% to 81.3%) for AbC-19 compared with the reference standards. Sensitivity for sera from matched clinical samples performed on AbC-19 was significantly higher with serum than finger prick at 92% (80.0% to 97.7%, P=0.01). Antibody titres varied considerably among cohorts. The numbers of positive samples identified by finger prick in the lowest antibody titre quarter varied among LFIAs. Conclusions: One new LFIA was identified with clinical performance suitable for potential inclusion in seroprevalence studies. However, none of the LFIAs tested had clearly superior performance to the LFIA currently used in React 2 seroprevalence surveys, and none showed sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered for routine clinical use."

1318,Next-Generation COVID-19 Vaccines Should Take Efficiency of Distribution into Consideration.,"The dire need for safe and effective coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines is met with many vaccine candidates being evaluated in pre-clinical and clinical studies. The COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical trials as well as those that recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or other regulatory agencies worldwide require either cold (i.e., 2-8°C) or even freezing temperatures as low as -70°C for storage and distribution. Thus, existing cold chain will struggle to support both the standard national immunization programs and COVID-19 vaccination. The requirement for cold chain is now a major challenge towards worldwide rapid mass vaccination against COVID-19. In this commentary, we stress that thermostabilizing technologies are available to enable cold chain-free vaccine storage and distribution, as well as potential needle-free vaccination. Significant efforts on thermostabilizing technologies must now be applied on next-generation COVID-19 vaccines for more cost-effective worldwide mass vaccination and COVID-19 eradication."
1319,COVID-19 Vaccine Race: Analysis of Age-Dependent Immune Responses against SARS-CoV-2 Indicates that more than Just One Strategy May Be Needed.,"In December 2019, a novel respiratory coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 appeared in China, causing the disease termed COVID-19 that has caused millions of infections worldwide. In this article, we have analyzed existing evidence on the immune response against SARS coronaviruses in order to understand the possible outcome of a vaccine for COVID-19. From our analysis, it becomes clear that there is a big difference in the immune response against SARS in children, young adults and the elderly, both at the innate and adaptive levels. Taking this information into account, we have studied the strategies that are being used for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. We discussed the perspectives for obtention and worldwide distribution of reliable vaccines using this perspective. The conclusion is that different vaccines may be protective for different age segments within the population, depending on the strategy used for their design. Therefore, it will become necessary for several vaccines to reach the finish line, not only to ensure availability, but also to guarantee an adequate immune response at the individual level."
