1620,"Antibodies for COVID-19 - which, when and how long?","Infection with SARS-CoV2 leads to COVID-19, the severity of which derives from the host’s immune response, especially the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This coronavirus infects by first binding to the ectoenzyme Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a serine protease acting as the receptor, while another serine protease is necessary for priming the viral spike “S” protein required for entering the cells. Repurposing existing drugs for potential anti-coronavirus activity have failed. As a result, there were intense efforts to rapidly produce ways of providing prophylactic active immunization (vaccines) or abortive passive (convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies) neutralizing antibodies. The availability of vaccines for COVID-19 have been largely successful, but many questions still remain unanswered. In spite of the original enthusiasm, clinical studies using convalescent serum or monoclonal antibodies have shown limited benefit. Moreover, the emergence of Long-COVID syndrome in most infected patients necessitates the development of treatment approaches that may prevent viral entry by blocking both serine proteases involved, as with a liposomal blend of the natural flavonoids luteolin and quercetin."
1621,The Current Status of Drug Repositioning and Vaccine Developments for the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified, the world has vehemently worked to develop treatments and vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at an unprecedented speed. Few of the repositioned drugs for COVID-19 have shown that they were efficacious and safe. In contrast, a couple of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will be ready for mass rollout early next year. Despite successful vaccine development for COVID-19, the world will face a whole new set of challenges including scale-up manufacturing, cold-chain logistics, long-term safety, and low vaccine acceptance. We highlighted the importance of knowledge sharing and collaboration to find innovative answers to these challenges and to prepare for newly emerging viruses."
1622,Inference of SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding neutralizing antibody titers in sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients by using commercial enzyme and chemiluminescent immunoassays.,"Whether antibody levels measured by commercially available enzyme or chemiluminescent immunoassays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein can act as a proxy for serum neutralizing activity remains to be established for many of these assays. We evaluated the degree of correlation between neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG levels measured by four commercial immunoassays in sera drawn from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Ninety sera from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were tested by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG, and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assays. Overall, the results obtained with the COVID-19 ELISA IgG test showed the highest agreement with the NtAb assay (κ, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1). The most sensitive tests were the pseudotyped virus NtAb assay and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assay (92.2% for both). Overall, the degree correlation between antibody titers resulting in 50% virus neutralization (NtAb50) in the pseudotyped virus assay and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels was strong for the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (rho = 0.73) and moderate for the remaining assays (rho = 0.48 to 0.59). The kinetic profile of serum NtAb50 titers could not be reliably predicted by any of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays. The suitability of SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG commercial immunoassays for inferring neutralizing activity of sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients varies widely across tests and is influenced by the time of sera collection after the onset of symptoms."
1623,Analysis of the specificity of a COVID-19 antigen test in the Slovak mass testing program.,"Aims: Mass antigen testing programs have been challenged because of an alleged insufficient specificity, leading to a large number of false positives. The objective of this study is to derive a lower bound of the specificity of the SD Biosensor Standard Q Ag-Test in large scale practical use. Methods: Based on county data from the nationwide tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Slovakia between 31.10.-1.11. 2020 we calculate a lower confidence bound for the specificity. As positive test results were not systematically verified by PCR tests, we base the lower bound on a worst case assumption, assuming all positives to be false positives. Results: 3,625,332 persons from 79 counties were tested. The lowest positivity rate was observed in the county of Rožňava where 100 out of 34307 (0.29%) tests were positive. This implies a test specificity of at least 99.6% (97.5% one-sided lower confidence bound, adjusted for multiplicity). Conclusion: The obtained lower bound suggests a higher specificity compared to earlier studies in spite of the underlying worst case assumption and the application in a mass testing setting. The actual specificity is expected to exceed 99.6% if the prevalence in the respective regions was non-negligible at the time of testing. To our knowledge, this estimate constitutes the first bound obtained from large scale practical use of an antigen test."

1625,A Review of the Current Status of Clinical Management of COVID-19 in the Elderly.,"The high infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), and our limited understanding of the biology of the novel coronavirus, as well as the lack of an effective treatment for COVID-19, have created a global pandemic. Those most likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19 are adults, especially the elderly and those who are already weak or sick. At present, a specific drug for treatment of COVID-19 has not been developed. This, combined with the typical coexistence of a variety of chronic diseases in elderly patients, makes treatment challenging at present. In addition, for elderly patients, COVID-19 isolation measures during the epidemic can easily lead to psychological problems. Thus, how to manage elderly patients has become a focus of social attention in the current circumstances. This article reviews the effects of COVID-19 and makes management suggestions for elderly patients during this epidemic period. In addition to the elderly, critically ill people are also highly susceptible to this novel coronavirus. For elderly COVID-19 patients, antiviral therapy, immune regulation, and even auxiliary respiratory therapy can be given after a comprehensive evaluation of the disease. With the approval and use of COVID-19 vaccines, it is reasonable to expect that we can conquer SARS-CoV-2."
1626,SARS-CoV-2: Unique Challenges of the Virus and Vaccines.,"In November 2019, the highly infectious coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to almost all countries worldwide. Since its emergence, the COVID-19 infection has led to significant public health, economic and social problems. The current pandemic has inspired researchers to make every effort to design and develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine to provide sufficient protection against the virus and control the infection. In December 2020, the Pfizer vaccine was the first COVID-19 vaccine given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and the second FDA so-approved vaccine was the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, which was introduced a week later. Both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based vaccines, and are estimated to have an efficacy rate of more than 94%. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the attempts made to develop safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, highlighting potential challenges and concerns, such as disease enhancement, virus mutations, and public acceptance of the vaccine."
1627,Can mRNA Vaccines Turn the Tables During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Current Status and Challenges.,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect millions of people across the world. The current global statistics for the disease are 111 million cases and 2.45 million deaths, with new cases emerging each day. Although several drugs including remdesivir have been approved for emergency use, they remain ineffective in bringing the infection under control. Therefore, there is a need for highly effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. The recent advancements in mRNA vaccines have catapulted them to be forefront in the race to develop vaccines for COVID-19. Two mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics, respectively, have been granted authorization for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Interim analysis of the clinical trials for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines reported an efficacy of 95% and 94.1%, respectively, after the second dose. The adverse events for both the vaccines have been found to be mild to moderate, with mostly injection-site reactions and fatigue. No serious adverse events have been reported. Moreover, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics have announced that their vaccines are effective even against the new strains (B.1.17 and B.1.351) of the virus. Both companies are now scaling up the production of the vaccines to meet the global demand. Although the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of these vaccines is uncertain, there is hope that they can turn the tables against COVID-19 in this current pandemic situation."

1629,Immunological considerations for SARS-CoV-2 human challenge studies.,"The ethics and practicalities of controlled human infection with SARS-CoV-2 have been widely discussed. Potential risks are clear. The case in favour hinges upon whether these risks can be mitigated to an acceptable, very low, level and whether the studies will provide substantial benefits that could not readily be obtained by other means. Here, we discuss the immunological considerations relating to each side of this balance."
