3440,Bioengineered in Vitro Tissue Models to Study SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Validation.,"Given the various viral outbreaks in the 21st century, specifically the present pandemic situation arising from SARS-CoV-2 or the coronavirus, of unknown magnitude, there is an unmet clinical need to develop effective therapeutic and diagnostic strategies to combat this infectious disease worldwide. To develop precise anticoronavirus drugs and prophylactics, tissue engineering and biomaterial research strategies can serve as a suitable alternative to the conventional treatment options. Therefore, in this Review, we have highlighted various tissue engineering-based diagnostic systems for SARS-CoV-2 and suggested how these strategies involving organ-on-a-chip, organoids, 3D bioprinting, and advanced bioreactor models can be employed to develop in vitro human tissue models, for more efficient diagnosis, drug/vaccine development, and focusing on the need for patient-specific therapy. We believe that combining the basics of virology with tissue engineering techniques can help the researchers to understand the molecular mechanism underlying viral infection, which is critical for effective drug design. In addition, it can also serve to be a suitable platform for drug testing and delivery of small molecules that can lead to therapeutic tools in this dreaded pandemic situation. Additionally, we have also discussed the essential biomaterial properties which polarize the immune system, including dendritic cells and macrophages, toward their inflammatory phenotype, which can thus serve as a reference for exhibiting the role of biomaterial in influencing the adaptive immune response involving B and T lymphocytes to foster a regenerative tissue microenvironment. The situation arising from SARS-CoV-2 poses a challenge to scientists from almost all disciplines, and we feel that tissue engineers can thus provide new translational opportunities in this dreadful pandemic situation."

3443,Optimization and Clinical Evaluation of a Multi-Target Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasopharyngeal Samples.,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, which has spread worldwide, affecting more than 200 countries, infecting over 140 million people in one year. The gold standard to identify infected people is RT-qPCR, which is highly sensitive, but needs specialized equipment and trained personnel. The demand for these reagents has caused shortages in certain countries. Isothermal nucleic acid techniques, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have emerged as an alternative or as a complement to RT-qPCR. In this study, we developed and evaluated a multi-target RT-LAMP for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The method was evaluated against an RT-qPCR in 152 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. The results obtained indicated that both assays presented a ""good concordance"" (Cohen's k of 0.69), the RT-LAMP was highly specific (99%) but had lower sensitivity compared to the gold standard (63.3%). The calculated low sensitivity was associated with samples with very low viral load (RT-qPCR Cq values higher than 35) which may be associated with non-infectious individuals. If an internal Cq threshold below 35 was set, the sensitivity and Cohen's k increased to 90.9% and 0.92, respectively. The interpretation of the Cohen's k for this was ""very good concordance"". The RT-LAMP is an attractive approach for frequent individual testing in decentralized setups."
3444,Immunogenicity of clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in nonhuman primates and humans.,"Multiple preventive vaccines are being developed to counter the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The leading candidates have now been evaluated in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and human phase 1 and/or phase 2 clinical trials. Several vaccines have already advanced into phase 3 efficacy trials, while others will do so before the end of 2020. Here, we summarize what is known of the antibody and T cell immunogenicity of these vaccines in NHPs and humans. To the extent possible, we compare how the vaccines have performed, taking into account the use of different assays to assess immunogenicity and inconsistencies in how the resulting data are presented. We also review the outcome of challenge experiments with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in immunized macaques, while noting variations in the protocols used, including but not limited to the virus challenge doses. Press releases on the outcomes of vaccine efficacy trials are also summarized."
3445,Decreasing transmission and initiation of countrywide vaccination: Key challenges for future management of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.,"With a fragile healthcare system, Bangladesh, much like other countries in South East Asia, struggled during the early days of COVID-19 pandemic. In following months several encouraging initiatives were undertaken including nationwide lockdown, maintaining social distancing and setting up COVID-19 dedicated laboratories and hospitals. Despite fear of an escalation in COVID-19 transmission during the winter months like their European counterparts, fortunately infection rates subsided and Bangladesh came out largely unharmed. But the next phase of COVID-19 pandemic management that includes viral transmission suppression and conduction of nationwide immunization program require several urgent steps from government of Bangladesh (GoB) and relevant stakeholders. This qualitative research piece discussed about issues including an urgent need to enhance critical care facilities around the country, especially in peripheral districts; ramping up COVID-19 testing at existing laboratories in view of diagnosing each case, and ensuring vaccines for the vulnerable populations in the country. Furthermore, the researchers shed light on other issues including a need to reinforce a struggling healthcare workforce, encouraging people to take vaccine, proper maintenance of social distancing regulations, routine epidemiological surveillance, management of environment and biomedical waste and undertaking a holistic approach to combat the pandemic and its environmental and financial consequences."
3446,Management and outcomes of a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing home with predominantly Black residents.,"Background/objectives: Few studies present clinical management approaches and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). We describe outcomes of a clinical management pathway for a large COVID-19 outbreak in an urban SNF with predominantly racial minority (>90% black), medically complex, older residents. Design: Single-center, retrospective, and observational cohort study (March 1, 2020-May 31, 2020). Setting and participants: All subacute and long-term care residents at an urban SNF between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 (Chicago, IL). Intervention: A multicomponent management pathway was developed to manage a large COVID-19 outbreak in an SNF. Measurements: Chart review was used to extract demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, lab results, and clinical outcomes over 12 weeks, which were summarized and compared between residents with and without COVID-19. Results: A multicomponent clinical management pathway was used to care for residents with COVID-19, which included frequent scheduled clinical and laboratory evaluation, use of intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen, antibiotics when indicated, and goals-of-care discussions. Of the 204 residents, 172 (84.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the 3-month period, with 50.5% symptomatic, 9.3% presymptomatic, and 24.5% asymptomatic, with a 30-day mortality rate of 15.7%. Predominant symptoms were low-grade fever >99 °F, anorexia, delirium, and fatigue. While in the facility, approximately one-quarter of residents experienced hypernatremia [Na > 145 mEq/L] (24.5%), acute kidney injury [Cr > 0.03 mg/dL or 1.5× baseline] (29.7%), or leukopenia [WBC < 4.8 1000/mm3 ] (39.4%). Conclusion: We present the first available clinical strategy guiding the medical management of a COVID-19 syndrome in an urban SNF, caring for largely black residents, which may lead to improved mortality."

3448,Quantifying the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectiousness.,"The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectiousness is poorly known. Using data from a cohort of cases and high-risk contacts, we reconstructed viral load at the time of contact and inferred the probability of infection. The effect of viral load was larger in household contacts than in non-household contacts, with a transmission probability as large as 48% when the viral load was greater than 1010 copies per mL. The transmission probability peaked at symptom onset, with a mean probability of transmission of 29%, with large individual variations. The model also projects the effects of variants on disease transmission. Based on the current knowledge that viral load is increased by two- to eightfold with variants of concern and assuming no changes in the pattern of contacts across variants, the model predicts that larger viral load levels could lead to a relative increase in the probability of transmission of 24% to 58% in household contacts, and of 15% to 39% in non-household contacts."
3449,On the Sensitivity and Specificity of Postmortem Upper Respiratory Tract Testing for SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: Postmortem testing can improve our understanding of the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) if sufficiently sensitive and specific. Methods: We investigated the postmortem sensitivity and specificity of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on upper respiratory swabs using a dataset of everyone tested for SARS-CoV-2 before and after death in England, 1 March to 29 October 2020. We analyzed sensitivity in those with a positive test before death by time to postmortem test. We developed a multivariate model and conducted time-to-negativity survival analysis. For specificity, we analyzed those with a negative test in the week before death. Results: Postmortem testing within a week after death had a sensitivity of 96.8% if the person had tested positive within a week before death. There was no effect of age, sex, or specimen type on sensitivity, but individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related codes on their death certificate were 5.65 times more likely to test positive after death (95% confidence interval, 2.31-13.9). Specificity was 94.2%, increasing to 97.5% in individuals without COVID-19 on the death certificate. Conclusion: Postmortem testing has high sensitivity (96.8%) and specificity (94.2%) if performed within a week after death and could be a useful diagnostic tool."
