6550,Cardiovascular disease in patients with COVID-19: evidence from cardiovascular pathology to treatment.,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly developed into a global pneumonia pandemic. Cardiovascular disease is the major comorbidity of COVID-19 patients and is closely related to the severity of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can directly or indirectly cause a series of cardiac complications, including acute myocardial injury and myocarditis, heart failure and cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and coagulation abnormalities. Intensive research on the SARS-CoV-2-associated cardiovascular complications is urgently needed to elucidate its exact mechanism and to identify potential drug targets, which will help to formulate effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, this review will summarize recent progress regarding the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system and describe the underlying mechanism of cardiovascular injury caused by SARS-CoV-2."
6551,SARS-CoV 2; Possible alternative virus receptors and pathophysiological determinants.,"Understanding how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highjacks epithelial cells and infiltrates the lung, as well as other organs and tissues, is essential for developing treatment strategies and vaccines against this highly contagious virus. Another major goal is to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV- 2 bypasses the innate immune system and induces a cytokine storm, and its effects on mortality. Currently, SARS- CoV-2 is thought to evade innate antiviral immunity, undergo endocytosis, and fuse with the host cell membrane by exploiting ACE2 receptors and the protease TMMPRSS2, with cathepsin B/L as alternative protease, for entry into the epithelial cells of tissues vulnerable to developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. However, the incorporation of new and unique binding sites, i.e., O-linked glycans, and the preservation and augmentation of effective binding sites (N-linked glycans) on the outer membrane of SARS-CoV-2 may represent other strategies of infecting the human host. Here, I will rationalize the possibility that other host molecules-i.e., sugar molecules and the sialic acidsN-glycolylneuraminic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid, and their derivates could be viable candidates for the use as virus receptors by SARS-CoV-2 and/or serve as determinants for the adherence on ACE2 of SARS-CoV-2."
6552,"The Inclusive Review on SARS-CoV-2 Biology, Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Potential Management Options.","A novel coronavirus member was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, at the end of the year 2019. Initially, the infection spread locally, affecting the Wuhan people, and then expanded rapidly throughout the world. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed it a global pandemic. The virus is a new strain most closely related to a bat coronavirus (RaTG13) which was not previously discovered in humans and is now formally known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease syndrome that the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers. It is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through aerosols, direct/indirect contact, and also during medical procedures and specimen handling. The infection is characterized by isolated flu-like symptoms, but there may be specific signs of fever, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath, as well as the loss of smell and breathing difficulty. Within this report, we tried to review the most current scientific literature published by January 2021 on various aspects of the outbreak, including virus structure, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, potential therapeutics and vaccines, and prospects. We hope this article makes a beneficial impact on public education to better deal with the SARS-CoV-2 crisis and push a step forward in the near term towards its prevention and control."
6553,"COVID-19: a user's guide, status of the art and an original proposal to terminate viral recurrence.","The world is now entering its 9th month of combat against a pandemic of deadly pneumonia. Started out from China in December 2019, the disease has been declared as caused by infection with a so far unknown RNA Coronavirus of the respiratory family, then named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In the absence of a vaccine, and with scientists still struggling for an effective therapy, COVID-19 (the SARS-dependent syndrome) carries up to now, a death toll of more than 590,000 (July 18,2020) undermining jobs and finance of contemporary society in all continents. Social distancing, the only measure hitherto shown to restrain virus spread, has been progressively loosened from May 2020 in some countries, leaving us in the fear of repeat attacks from the unchecked virus. We discuss the problem and propose to tentatively boost the antivirus cell machinery by using lab-made viral mimics to engage cell receptors."
6554,The self-assembled nanoparticle-based trimeric RBD mRNA vaccine elicits robust and durable protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in mice.,"As COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly worldwide and variants continue to emerge, the development and deployment of safe and effective vaccines are urgently needed. Here, we developed an mRNA vaccine based on the trimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein fused to ferritin-formed nanoparticles (TF-RBD). Compared to the trimeric form of the RBD mRNA vaccine (T-RBD), TF-RBD delivered intramuscularly elicited robust and durable humoral immunity as well as a Th1-biased cellular response. After further challenge with live SARS-CoV-2, immunization with a two-shot low-dose regimen of TF-RBD provided adequate protection in hACE2-transduced mice. In addition, the mRNA template of TF-RBD was easily and quickly engineered into a variant vaccine to address SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The TF-RBD multivalent vaccine produced broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variants. This mRNA vaccine based on the encoded self-assembled nanoparticle-based trimer RBD provides a reference for the design of mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2."
6555,"SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial infection acquired in a French university hospital during the 1st wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a prospective study.","Background: In healthcare facilities, nosocomial transmissions of respiratory viruses are a major issue. SARS-CoV-2 is not exempt from nosocomial transmission. Our goals were to describe COVID-19 nosocomial cases during the first pandemic wave among patients in a French university hospital and compliance with hygiene measures. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study in Grenoble Alpes University Hospital from 01/03/2020 to 11/05/2020. We included all hospitalised patients with a documented SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Nosocomial case was defined by a delay of 5 days between hospitalisation and first symptoms. Hygiene measures were evaluated between 11/05/2020 and 22/05/2020. Lockdown measures were effective in France on 17/03/2020 and ended on 11/05/2020. Systematic wearing of mask was mandatory for all healthcare workers (HCW) and visits were prohibited in our institution from 13/03/2021 and for the duration of the lockdown period. Results: Among 259 patients included, 14 (5.4%) were considered as nosocomial COVID-19. Median time before symptom onset was 25 days (interquartile range: 12-42). Eleven patients (79%) had risk factors for severe COVID-19. Five died (36%) including 4 deaths attributable to COVID-19. Two clusters were identified. The first cluster had 5 cases including 3 nosocomial acquisitions and no tested HCWs were positive. The second cluster had 3 cases including 2 nosocomial cases and 4 HCWs were positive. Surgical mask wearing and hand hygiene compliance were adequate for 95% and 61% of HCWs, respectively. Conclusions: The number of nosocomial COVID-19 cases in our hospital was low. Compliance regarding mask wearing, hand hygiene and lockdown measures drastically reduced transmission of the virus. Monitoring of nosocomial COVID-19 cases during the first wave enabled us to determine to what extent the hygiene measures taken were effective and patients protected. Trial registration Study ethics approval was obtained retrospectively on 30 September 2020 (CECIC Rh√¥ne-Alpes-Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, IRB 5891)."

6557,Development of a model-inference system for estimating epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.,"To support COVID-19 pandemic planning, we develop a model-inference system to estimate epidemiological properties of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern using case and mortality data while accounting for under-ascertainment, disease seasonality, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and mass-vaccination. Applying this system to study three variants of concern, we estimate that B.1.1.7 has a 46.6% (95% CI: 32.3-54.6%) transmissibility increase but nominal immune escape from protection induced by prior wild-type infection; B.1.351 has a 32.4% (95% CI: 14.6-48.0%) transmissibility increase and 61.3% (95% CI: 42.6-85.8%) immune escape; and P.1 has a 43.3% (95% CI: 30.3-65.3%) transmissibility increase and 52.5% (95% CI: 0-75.8%) immune escape. Model simulations indicate that B.1.351 and P.1 could outcompete B.1.1.7 and lead to increased infections. Our findings highlight the importance of preventing the spread of variants of concern, via continued preventive measures, prompt mass-vaccination, continued vaccine efficacy monitoring, and possible updating of vaccine formulations to ensure high efficacy."

6559,Utility of repeat testing for COVID-19: Laboratory stewardship when the stakes are high.,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to circulate, testing strategies are of the utmost importance. Given national shortages of testing supplies, personal protective equipment, and other hospital resources, diagnostic stewardship is necessary to aid in resource management. We report the low utility of serial testing in a low-prevalence setting."
