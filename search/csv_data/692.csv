6910,Chronic kidney disease is a very significant comorbidity for high risk of death in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a recognized public health problem and key determinant of poor health outcomes. In Mexico, this condition has been associated with high and significant risk of death in COVID-19 patients; however, not enough attention has been given to the vulnerable population as the increasing numbers and fatality rates suggest. This study evaluated the effect of interaction between CKD condition and other risk factors (sex, diabetes, hypertension and obesity) on the survival rate of positive patients for COVID-19 in Mexico. The results from this study support that CKD patients is a population at high risk for mortality for COVID-19 and that COVID-19 positive inpatients with CKD and diabetes are highly vulnerable to death."
6911,The role of chest computed tomography in the management of COVID-19: A review of results and recommendations.,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been worldwide, and clinicians and researchers around the world have been working to develop effective and efficient methods for early detection as well as monitoring of the disease progression. This minireview compiles the various agency and expert recommendations, along with results from studies published in numerous countries, in an effort to facilitate the research in imaging technology development to benefit the detection and monitoring of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review paper on the topic, and it provides a brief, yet comprehensive analysis."

6914,"Evolving biothreat of variant SARS-CoV-2 - molecular properties, virulence and epidemiology.","SARS-CoV-2 are enveloped RNA viruses that belong to the family Coronaviridae of genus Beta coronavirus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The mutation rate is high among RNA viruses and in particular, coronavirus replication is error prone with an estimated mutation rate of 4x10-4 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported from various countries like United Kingdom, South Africa, Denmark, Brazil and India. These variants evolved due to mutations in spike gene of SARS-CoV-2. The most concerning variants are Variant of Concern (VOC) 202012/01 from United Kingdom and B.1.617 variant of India. Other variants include B.1.351 lineages, cluster 5/SARS-CoV-2 variant of Denmark, 501.V2 variant/SARS-CoV-2 variant of South Africa, lineage B.1.1.248/lineage P.1 of Brazil. Mutations in S protein may result in changes in the transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To date, alterations in virulence or pathogenicity have been reported among the variants from many parts of the globe. In our opinion, since the S protein is significantly altered, the suitability of existing vaccine specifically targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants is a major concern. The mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are a continuous and evolving process that may result in the transformation of naïve SARS-CoV-2 into totally new subsets of antigenically different SARS-CoV-2 viruses over a period of time."

6916,[Possibility of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019].,"2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has caused a global pandemic. Although researchers have carried out a lot of research on 2019-nCoV, analyzed the molecular structure and conducted evolutionary tree analysis, there is still insufficient understanding of its specific pathogenic mechanism, resulting in the lack of specific and effective therapeutic drugs and method. 2019-nCoV infection can cause inflammation and may deteriorate to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, which have become the main complication of its death. Therefore, using antiviral and symptomatic treatment with inflammation reduction can have a better therapeutic effect. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) not only have a significant immune-regulation function, but also play a role in regeneration and repair, repairing damaged lungs, so they can be considered as a new effective method for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This article analyzes the main pathogenic mechanism of 2019-nCoV, and the process of developing into ARDS, combined with the research status of MSCs, to explore its significance and feasibility for the treatment of COVID-19. Finally, it will provide a substantial theoretical basis for clinical treatment now and in the future."

6918,[Construction and evaluation of a novel diagnosis pathway for 2019-Corona Virus Disease].,"Objective: To construct and evaluate a diagnosis pathway (Xiangya pathway) for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Consecutive subjects aged ≥12 years old who were screened for COVID-19 were included in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 23 to February 3, 2020, and the subjects were further divided into the inception cohort and the validation cohort. The gender, age, onset time of disease of the subjects were recorded. The information of epidemiological history, fever, and the declined blood lymphocytes were collected as clinical indicators, CT scan was used to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement. According to the current Chinese national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xiangya pathway was constructed with multi-indexes, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and Chinese national standards, their effectiveness of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the inception and validation cohort. Results: A total of 382 consecutive adults who was screened for COVID-19 were included, and 261 cases were in the inception cohort and 121 cases were in the validation cohort. Among the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years). There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased peripheral blood lymphocytes, 114 cases (29.8%) with positive CT findings, 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive virus nucleic acid by throat swab. Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively. The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and declined blood lymphocyte count (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, P=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively). The sensitivity of this pathway and the pathway recommended by the Health Commission of China were both high (all were 1.000), while the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya pathway were higher than the one recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both P<0.001). The CT-COVID-19 reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64), with difference rate of 51.6%, and the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31). In validation cohort, the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya pathway was 0.967, the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 76.9%(10/13). Conclusions: The Xiangya pathway can predict the nucleic acid test results of COVID-19, and can be applied as a reliable strategy to screen patients with suspected COVID-19 among people aged ≥12 years in areas other than Hubei during the epidemic period of COVID-19. The cohort size needs to be increased for further validation."
