2020,Of Mice and Schoolchildren: A Conceptual History of Herd Immunity.,"This article explores a tension at the core of the concept of herd immunity that has been overlooked in public and scientific discussions-namely: how can immunity, a phenomenon of individual biological defenses, be made relevant to populations? How can collectives be considered ""immune""? Over the course of more than a century of use of the term, scientists have developed many different understandings of the concept in response to this inherent tension. Originating among veterinary scientists in the United States in the late 19th century, the concept was adopted by British scientists researching human infectious disease by the early 1920s. It soon became a staple concept for epidemiologists interested in disease ecology, helping to articulate the population dynamics of diseases such as diphtheria and influenza. Finally, though more traditional understandings of the concept remained in scientific use, in the era after World War II, it increasingly came to signal the objective and outcome of mass vaccination. Recognizing the complexity of scientific efforts to resolve the paradox of herd immunity may help us consider the best distribution of immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."
2021,Fighting Strategies Against the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic: Impact on Global Economy.,"Sudden outbreak of a new pathogen in numbers of pneumonic patients in Wuhan province during December 2019 has threatened the world population within a short period of its occurrence. This respiratory tract-isolated pathogen was initially named as novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV-2019), but later termed as SARS-CoV-2. The rapid spreading of this infectious disease received the label of pandemic by the World Health Organization within 4 months of its occurrence, which still seeks continuous attention of the researchers to prevent the spread and for cure of the infected patients. The propagation of the disease has been recorded in 215 countries, with more than 25.5 million cases and a death toll of more than 0.85 million. Several measures are taken to control the disease transmission, and researchers are actively engaged in finding suitable therapeutics to effectively control the disease to minimize the mortality and morbidity rates. Several existing potential candidates were explored in the prevention and treatment of worsening condition of COVID-19 patients; however, none of the formulation has been approved for the treatment but used under medical supervision. In this article, a focus has been made to highlight on current epidemiology on the COVID-19 infection, clinical features, diagnosis, and transmission, with special emphasis on treatment measures of the disease at different stages of clinical research and the global economic influence due to this pandemic situation. Progress in the development on vaccine against COVID-19 has also been explored as important measures to immunize people. Moreover, this article is expected to provide information to the researchers, who are constantly combating in the management against this outbreak."
2022,Subacute thyroiditis after inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.,"Viral infections have often been associated with subacute (De Quervain) thyroiditis. Rare cases of subacute thyroiditis have been reported after vaccines. Various vaccines have been developed with different techniques against SARS-CoV-2. This case report presents a rare case of subacute thyroiditis after the inactive SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, CoronaVac."
2023,Principles and new perspectives in the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus.,"It has been a year since the first person on Earth became infected with a new type of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing infectious acute respiratory disease COVID-19 with relatively high morbidity and mortality. The most endangered population by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are healthcare professionals, the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. Due to the fast community spread, governments of different European countries introduced precaution measures including limited socializing of people, closing of most public services and introducing mandatory facial protection. The hope for a return to the life before the pandemic is the development of an effective and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 which would presumably reduce the incidence of severe forms of COVID-19 and prevent the massive spread of the disease. At the end of November, we have 13 clinical trials in phase III involving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on inactivated viruses, recombinant non-pathogenic viral vectors and proteins. The first mRNA-based vaccine is currently being evaluated in phase II/III clinical trial and is already being distributed and applied to high-risk population in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Israel, followed by the countries of the European Union, including the Czech Republic. In the review article we present currently ongoing clinical studies with a special focus on the phase III clinical trials and discuss the mechanisms of action of each type of vaccine."
2024,Neutralization of VUI B.1.1.28 P2 variant with sera of COVID-19 recovered cases and recipients of Covaxin an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine.,Our study has shown 1.09 and 1.92 fold reductions in the neutralizing titer with sera of individuals with natural infection and Covaxin vaccine recipients against B.1.1.28.2 variant.
2025,"COVID-19 and Domestic Animals: Exploring the Species Barrier Crossing, Zoonotic and Reverse Zoonotic Transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Background: To date, more than thirty animals have been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; all of them infected by humans with COVID-19. Some animal experiments suggested the possibility of animal to animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that was seen in some cases of infected animals. Animal to human transmission was considered unlikely until investigations revealed the possibility of mink to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands. Objective: The current study aims at highlighting the predominance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various animal species, reverse zoonotic transmission and proposing possible animal models that might aid in the study and development of a vaccine against Covid-19. Methods: The authors have gathered information on various animal species infected with SARS-CoV-2 and possible tests conducted via online news reports, websites and Scopus indexed journals. Results: The study of the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to domestic animals concluded that pigs, chicken, and ducks were not vulnerable to Covid-19; dogs showed less susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and cats as well as ferrets were seen susceptible to Covid-19. SARS-CoV-2 has been seen crossing the species barrier, infecting humans from the wild with the yet unclear source, spreading from humans to humans quickly, humans to animals, animals to animals, and is likely to spread from animals to humans even though minimally. Animals appear somewhat resistant to SARS-CoV-2 transmission compared to humans who globally crossed eight million infection cases, and the infected animals mostly do not show many complications and recover quickly. Conclusion: Precautions are advised to prevent human to animal transmission of the virus, and in some areas, to avoid animal to human spread of the virus. Further monitoring is required to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals as COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving condition worldwide. Cats and ferrets have physiological resemblance and genome sequencing studies propose the possibility of these species to be used as animal models for investigating the SARS-CoV-2 infection and this might aid in further studies and vaccine development against Covid-19."
2026,Effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers.,"The present study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of BNT162b2 among HCWs of a university hospital while a recrudescence of pandemics was hitting the province, with a high rate of the B.1.1.7 variant. Methods: The study was performed in the context of health surveillance at the workplaces. We monitored the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptoms among HCWs classified by having received the entire vaccine schedule or not; the latter further classified in not vaccinated workers and workers who had received the first shot more than 14 days earlier. The SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by conventional RT-PCR on rhino-pharyngeal swabs, followed by gene sequencing in positive vaccinated HCWs. The cumulative incidence of infections in the period was normalised to 100,000 people. Results: At the end of the observation period, HCWs that had completed the full schedule were at lower infection risk than both unvaccinated HCWs and the workforce who had not yet gained the complete theoretical protection from the vaccine (by 2.4-folds). Overall, ninety-two SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed among HCWs, mostly among not protected workers (52 cases) but none of them showed symptoms requiring hospitalisation. Conclusions: The vaccination campaign effectively reduced the appearance of symptoms and the incidence of infections among vaccinated HCWs. Among vaccinated HCWs, gene sequencing was possible in five cases only, 4 B.1.1.7 and 1 B1.525 variants. The high rate of unsuccessful gene sequencing observed among infected vaccinated workers could be explained by a low viral burden. Vaccination for COVID-19 should be mandatory in occupational settings with a high infective risk."
2027,Impact of virus genetic variability and host immunity for the success of COVID-19 vaccines.,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) continues to challenge most scientists in the search of an effective way to either prevent infection or to avoid spreading of the disease. As result of global efforts some advances have been reached and we are more prepared today than we were at the beginning of the pandemic, however not enough to stop the transmission, and many questions remain unanswered. The possibility of reinfection of recovered individuals, the duration of the immunity, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the spreading of the disease as well as the degree of protection that a potential vaccine could have are some of the issues under debate. A number of vaccines are under development using different platforms and clinical trials are ongoing in different countries, but even if they are licensed it will need time until reach a definite conclusion about their real safety and efficacy. Herein we discuss the different strategies used in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, the questions underlying the type of immune response they may elicit, the consequences that new mutations may have in the generation of sub-strains of SARS-CoV-2 and their impact and challenges for the efficacy of potential vaccines in a scenario postpandemic."
2028,Exploratory analysis to identify the best antigen and the best immune biomarkers to study SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Background: Recent studies proposed the whole-blood based IFN-γ-release assay to study the antigen-specific SARS-CoV-2 response. Since the early prediction of disease progression could help to assess the optimal treatment strategies, an integrated knowledge of T-cell and antibody response lays the foundation to develop biomarkers monitoring the COVID-19. Whole-blood-platform tests based on the immune response detection to SARS-CoV2 peptides is a new approach to discriminate COVID-19-patients from uninfected-individuals and to evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates, monitoring the immune response in vaccine trial and supporting the serological diagnostics results. Here, we aimed to identify in the whole-blood-platform the best immunogenic viral antigen and the best immune biomarker to identify COVID-19-patients. Methods: Whole-blood was overnight-stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools of nucleoprotein-(NP) Membrane-, ORF3a- and Spike-protein. We evaluated: IL-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL- 15, IL-17A, eotaxin, FGF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, PDGF, RANTES, TNF-α, VEGF. By a sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis we identified the most important soluble factors discriminating COVID-19- from NO-COVID-19-individuals. Results: We identified a COVID-19 signature based on six immune factors: IFN-γ, IP-10 and IL-2 induced by Spike; RANTES and IP-10 induced by NP and IL-2 induced by ORF3a. We demonstrated that the test based on IP-10 induced by Spike had the highest AUC (0.85, p < 0.0001) and that the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19-patients did not affect IP-10 production. Finally, we validated the use of IP-10 as biomarker for SARS-CoV2 infection in two additional COVID-19-patients cohorts. Conclusions: We set-up a whole-blood assay identifying the best antigen to induce a T-cell response and the best biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection evaluating patients with acute COVID-19 and recovered patients. We focused on IP-10, already described as a potential biomarker for other infectious disease such as tuberculosis and HCV. An additional application of this test is the evaluation of immune response in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials: the IP-10 detection may define the immunogenicity of a Spike-based vaccine, whereas the immune response to the virus may be evaluated detecting other soluble factors induced by other viral-antigens."
2029,"[The organizational aspects of security support of participants of clinical testing of vaccine ""Gam-COVID-Vac""].","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in many aftermaths, economic crisis and extra charging of health care. The development of vaccine against SARS-nCoV-2 agent turned out as the priority task of world and Russian medicine and pharmaceutics. The investigation of efficiency and safety of vaccines can be prolonged for many years that can aggravate the observed crisis. Having regard to the global scope and speed of pandemic spreading, the vaccine ""Gam-COVID-Vac"" was registered with special procedure by the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 441 of 03.04.2020 for accelerated access to civic turn-over. To monitor safety of vaccine on the basis of international experience, the decision was made to organize the independent Committee of monitoring data concerning efficacy and safety of vaccines applied to prevent COVID-19. The article presents rationale for necessity to create independent committee and to implement such a practice."
