9940,Selenium (Se) plays a key role in the biological effects of some viruses: Implications for COVID-19.,"Host nutrition is an important factor affecting disease progression. Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for the human body with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune effects, and Se deficiency increases RNA-virus replication and virulent mutations, which lead to more severe tissue damage and symptoms. Low Se status in the host may be an important cause of health complications induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this article, we describe the metabolic mechanisms by which Se is involved in anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune effects, and review the role and clinical effects of Se in viral infection. We then discuss the potential relationship between Se and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The association between soil Se level and the incidence of COVID-19 was observed in different cities of Hubei Province. The incidence of COVID-19 was more than 10 times lower in Se-enriched cities (Enshi, Shiyan, and Xiangyang) than in Se-deficient cities (Suizhou and Xiaogan). Although the relationship between soil Se levels and the incidence of COVID-19 in Hubei still needs further study, these findings provide baseline information demonstrating the effect of Se levels on SARS-CoV-2, which could contribute to the prevention and management of COVID-19."
9941,Progress in Treatment of Myocardial Injury in Patients with 2019-nCoV: A Chinese Experience.,"Since December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection began to appear in Hubei Province of China and gradually spread to other provinces and other countries. The virus has the characteristics of strong transmission capacity, diverse clinical manifestations, long incubation period, and latent infection, thus posing a serious threat to human life safety and health. With the increasing number of cases and the continuous enrichment of clinical data, 2019-nCoV-infected patients have received more and more attention regarding myocardial injury related to virus infection besides typical respiratory system manifestations. According to the published data, we summarize the myocardial injury manifestations, characteristics, effects on disease condition, and prognosis of 2019-nCoV-infected patients and discuss the possible injury mechanism, treatment methods, and future research directions."
9942,Human species D adenovirus hexon capsid protein mediates cell entry through a direct interaction with CD46.,"Human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D) types are currently being explored as vaccine vectors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other severe infectious diseases. The efficacy of such vector-based vaccines depends on functional interactions with receptors on host cells. Adenoviruses of different species are assumed to enter host cells mainly by interactions between the knob domain of the protruding fiber capsid protein and cellular receptors. Using a cell-based receptor-screening assay, we identified CD46 as a receptor for HAdV-D56. The function of CD46 was validated in infection experiments using cells lacking and overexpressing CD46, and by competition infection experiments using soluble CD46. Remarkably, unlike HAdV-B types that engage CD46 through interactions with the knob domain of the fiber protein, HAdV-D types infect host cells through a direct interaction between CD46 and the hexon protein. Soluble hexon proteins (but not fiber knob) inhibited HAdV-D56 infection, and surface plasmon analyses demonstrated that CD46 binds to HAdV-D hexon (but not fiber knob) proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy analysis of the HAdV-D56 virion-CD46 complex confirmed the interaction and showed that CD46 binds to the central cavity of hexon trimers. Finally, soluble CD46 inhibited infection by 16 out of 17 investigated HAdV-D types, suggesting that CD46 is an important receptor for a large group of adenoviruses. In conclusion, this study identifies a noncanonical entry mechanism used by human adenoviruses, which adds to the knowledge of adenovirus biology and can also be useful for development of adenovirus-based vaccine vectors."
9943,SARS-CoV-2 viral sepsis with meningoencephalitis.,"SARS-CoV-2 predominantly involves the lungs producing acute lung injury, but it can also give rise to a variety of complications involving the central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, kidney and also viral sepsis. With this case report, we are discussing unusual series of complication from acute lung injury, followed by viral sepsis then encephalitis, followed by progressive macrophage activation syndrome."
9944,Kinetics of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG among healthcare workers in a General Hospital.,"SARS-CoV-2 is a newly-discovered positive-sense RNA virus, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) currently spreading worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is considered a main target for neutralizing antibodies. In order to better understand the kinetics of the antibody response, we evaluated the relation between two consecutive antibody titers determined over an average period of four months. A total of 628 subjects were included in the study. A significant reduction of the antibody titers over time was found: Ab Titer 1: 8.1 Arbitrary Units (AU)/mL (IQR: 4.8-29.3); Ab Titer 2: 6.2 AU/mL (IQR: 0-28.5); p<0.0001. A Receiver Operator Characteristic curve analysis showed an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.973 (95% CI: 0.962-0.984; p<0.0001) with an Ab titer 1 threshold of 110 AU/mL to predict an Ab Titer 2 ≥50 AU/mL with 100% specificity. Likewise, an AUC of 0.952 (95% CI: 0.930-0.974; p<0.0001) with an Ab titer 1 threshold of 185 AU/mL was found to predict an Ab Titer 2 ≥100 AU/mL. This study showed that the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG median titer declined over an average period of four months and that the first IgG determination thresholds found can help predict IgG values after the same interval."

9947,"Editorial: Long COVID, or Post-COVID Syndrome, and the Global Impact on Health Care.","During 2020, increasing numbers of case reports, case series, and small observational studies reported long-term complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who had recovered from acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Long COVID has a prevalence of between 10-30% in patients with a recent history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pulmonary, hematologic, cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, renal, endocrine, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary, and dermatologic involvement, and chronic multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) highlights the requirement for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with long COVID. This Editorial aims to present the current status of long COVID, or post-COVID syndrome, and its global impact on health and the provision of health care."
