6400,"Intention to receive a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and its association with trust, worry and beliefs about the origin of the virus.","The aim of the current study was to determine the extent to which Italian people intend to receive a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and to investigate its associations with worry, institutional trust and beliefs about the non-natural origin of the virus. A sample of 624 people living in Italy was recruited in April 2020 using an online platform. The survey included questions about intention to receive a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, trust, worry and beliefs about the origin of the virus. Most respondents (75.8%) intended to receive a vaccine, while 32 (5.1%) and 63 (10.1%) participants responded 'No' and 'I do not know', respectively. The remaining participants (9.0%) chose not to respond to this question. Controlling for socio-demographic factors, a multinomial logistic regression model revealed that no intention to receive a vaccine was associated with lower levels of worry and institutional trust, while increased odds for responding 'do not know' were found among participants holding beliefs about the non-natural origin of the virus. Vaccine acceptance may not be sufficient to establish a high level of herd immunity and a successful implementation of new pandemic vaccination programs should take into account trust, conspiracy beliefs and worry."
6401,"Cross-Sectional Seroepidemiologic Study of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Close Contacts, Children, and Migrant Workers in Shanghai.","(1) Background: Along with an increasing risk caused by migrant workers returning to the urban areas for the resumption of work and production and growing epidemiological evidence of possible transmission during the incubation period, a study of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is warranted among key populations to determine the serum antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 and the carrying status of SARS-CoV-2 to identify potential asymptomatic infection and to explore the risk factors. (2) Method: This is a cross-sectional seroepidemiologic study. Three categories of targeted populations (close contacts, migrant workers who return to urban areas for work, and school children) will be included in this study as they are important for case identification in communities. A multi-stage sampling method will be employed to acquire an adequate sample size. Assessments that include questionnaires and blood, nasopharyngeal specimens, and feces collection will be performed via home-visit survey. (3) Ethics and Dissemination: The study was approved by the Institute Review Board of School of Public Health, Fudan University (IRB#2020-04-0818). Before data collection, written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The manuscripts from this work will be submitted for publication in quality peer-reviewed journals and presented at national or international conferences."
6402,Humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in dialysis patients: Integrating anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike-Protein-RBD antibody monitoring to manage dialysis centers in pandemic times.,"Dialysis patients are both the most likely to benefit from vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 and at the highest risk of not developing an immune response. Data from the medical field are thus mandatory. We report our experience with a BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine in a retrospective analysis of 241 dialysis patients including 193 who underwent anti-Spike-Protein-Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD) IgG analysis. We show that a pro-active vaccine campaign is effective in convincing most patients to be vaccinated (95%) and frequently elicits a specific antibody response (94.3% after two doses and 98.4% after three doses). Only immunocompromised Status is associated with lack of seroconversion (OR 7.6 [1.5-38.2], p = 0.02). We also identify factors associated with low response (last quartile; IgG<500AU/mL): immunocompromised status, age, absence of RAAS inhibitors, low lymphocytes count, high C Reactive Protein; and with high response (high quartile; IgG>7000AU/mL): age; previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and active Cancer. From this experience, we propose a strategy integrating anti-spike IgG monitoring to guide revaccination and dialysis center management in pandemic times."
6403,"Updating the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 ""suspected case"" and ""confirmed case"" is necessary.","On 6 February 2020, our team had published a rapid advice guideline for diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provided our experience and make well reference for fighting against this pandemic worldwide. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated. In this letter, we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of ""suspected case"" and ""confirmed case"" according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) that issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China."
6404,"Community-Based Testing for COVID-19 in a Low-Prevalence, Rural Area: Documentation of Logistics and Practical Aspects of Testing.","Introduction: Testing and mitigation strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often focus on high-prevalence, urban communities, leaving low-prevalence rural areas without specific strategies to maintain the health and safety of their populations. We evaluated a cost-effective strategy for SARS-CoV-2 testing to determine point prevalence in a rural community with a generally low prevalence of infection. Methods: We voluntarily tested asymptomatic clinic employees and conducted 2 community SARS-CoV-2 testing events in Cashton, Wisconsin, that included testing for asymptomatic persons. We also partnered with local clinics and public health departments to conduct weekly drive-up clinics for asymptomatic, high-risk persons identified through enhanced contact tracing. This was possible as testing capacity in Wisconsin never reached its maximum, and we continued symptomatic testing through our clinic. Results: We tested 61 employees, 268 individuals at 2 community events, 36 high-risk asymptomatic people at drive-up clinic events, and 128 symptomatic people within our clinic. We observed 1 positive result in asymptomatic people and 5 positive results in symptomatic patients, confirming the low prevalence in our area. Conclusions: Our testing events confirmed a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing prevalence information to local businesses and schools. We reinforced our partnership with local public health departments to facilitate enhanced contact tracing and test asymptomatic persons, and we provided a service to asymptomatic persons requiring testing for travel, school, or work. Local businesses and community members appreciated the services and expressed relief for point-in-time testing results during a period of stress and uncertainty."
6405,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in children aged 0 to 19 years in childcare facilities and schools after their reopening in May 2020, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.","We investigated data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected 0-19 year olds, who attended schools/childcare facilities, to assess their role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission after these establishments' reopening in May 2020 in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. Child-to-child transmission in schools/childcare facilities appeared very uncommon. We anticipate that, with face mask use and frequent ventilation of rooms, transmission rates in schools/childcare facilities would remain low in the next term, even if classes' group sizes were increased."
6406,Acute Myocardial Infarction Within 24 Hours After COVID-19 Vaccination.,"COVID-19 vaccination was launched in the United States in mid-December 2020. There are limited data on the risk of thrombotic events related to COVID-19 vaccines. In conclusion, we report 2 cases of acute myocardial infarction with onset <24 hours after the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in patients presenting with shoulder pain."

In this study, a synthetic DNA-based vaccine candidate, known as pSV10-SARS-CoV-2, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was designed and tested in 39 BALB/c mice with BC01, an adjuvant derived from unmethylated CpG motif-containing DNA fragments from the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin genome. Mice vaccinated with pSV10-SARS-CoV-2 with BC01 produced early neutralizing antibodies and developed stronger humoral and cellular immune responses compared to mice that received the DNA vaccine only. Moreover, sera from mice vaccinated with pSV10-SARS-CoV-2 with BC01 can neutralize certain variants, including 614G, 614G + 472 V, 452R, 483A, 501Y.V2, and B.1.1.7. The results of this study demonstrate that the addition of BC01 to a DNA-vaccine for COVID-19 could elicit more effective neutralizing antibody titers for disease prevention."
