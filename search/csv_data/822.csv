8210,Dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 genome variants in the feces during convalescence.,"In response to the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is crucial to understand the origin, transmission, and evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which relies on close surveillance of genomic diversity in clinical samples. Although the mutation at the population level had been extensively investigated, how the mutations evolve at the individual level is largely unknown. Eighteen time-series fecal samples were collected from nine patients with COVID-19 during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method. First, we demonstrated the outstanding performance of the hybrid capture method in detecting intra-host variants. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples. Among them, nineteen variants presented frequency changes > 0.3 within 1-5 days, reflecting highly dynamic intra-host viral populations. Moreover, the evolution of the viral genome demonstrated that the virus was probably viable in the gastrointestinal tract during the convalescent period. Meanwhile, we also found that the same mutation showed a distinct pattern of frequency changes in different individuals, indicating a strong random drift. In summary, dramatic changes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome were detected in fecal samples during the convalescent period; whether the viral load in feces is sufficient to establish an infection warranted further investigation."
8211,"In Vitro Assessment of the Antiviral Activity of Ketotifen, Indomethacin and Naproxen, Alone and in Combination, against SARS-CoV-2.","The 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is caused by infection with the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, the treatment options for COVID-19 are limited. The purpose of the experiments presented here was to investigate the effectiveness of ketotifen, naproxen and indomethacin, alone or in combination, in reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the drugs was evaluated. The findings showed that the combination of ketotifen with indomethacin (SJP-002C) or naproxen both reduce viral yield. Compared to ketotifen alone (60% inhibition at EC50), an increase in percentage inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 to 79%, 83% and 93% was found when co-administered with 25, 50 and 100 μM indomethacin, respectively. Compared to ketotifen alone, an increase in percentage inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 to 68%, 68% and 92% was found when co-administered with 25, 50 and 100 μM naproxen, respectively. For both drug combinations the observations suggest an additive or synergistic effect, compared to administering the drugs alone. No cytotoxic effects were observed for the administered dosages of ketotifen, naproxen, and indomethacin. Further research is warranted to investigate the efficacy of the combination of ketotifen with indomethacin (SJP-002C) or naproxen in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans."
8212,"Sequence Analysis of 20,453 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Genomes from the Houston Metropolitan Area Identifies the Emergence and Widespread Distribution of Multiple Isolates of All Major Variants of Concern.","Since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, there has been international concern about the emergence of virus variants with mutations that increase transmissibility, enhance escape from the human immune response, or otherwise alter biologically important phenotypes. In late 2020, several variants of concern emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), the South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California variants of interest (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility. For the South Africa and Brazil variants, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. On the basis of our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20,453 coronavirus disease 2019 patient samples collected from March 2020 to February 2021, we report identification of all six of these SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital (Houston, TX) patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency (aggregate of 1.1%) in the population, they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States in which active circulation of all six current variants of concern has been documented by genome sequencing. As vaccine deployment accelerates, increased genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understanding the presence, frequency, and medical impact of consequential variants and their patterns and trajectory of dissemination."
8213,"Attitudes towards influenza vaccine and a potential COVID-19 vaccine in Italy and differences across occupational groups, September 2020.","Objectives: We aimed at describing the attitudes towards influenza vaccination and a potential COVID-19 vaccine in Italy. Methods: A nationally representative survey based on 1055 Italians aged 15-85 years was conducted in September 16-28, 2020. Results: We found that 40.8% of the population reported the intention to be vaccinated against influenza next winter and 53.7% would accept to receive a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The percentages were higher among individuals aged 55 and over (58.8% for influenza vaccine and 58.2% for a potential COVID-19 vaccine) and among professionals, managers and teachers as compared to manual workers and farmers (36.1% vs. 27.6% for influenza vaccine and 51.6% vs. 44.8% for a potential COVID-19 vaccine). Discussion: These data confirm a certain degree of vaccine mistrust in Italy, especially among less qualified workers."
8214,Anaphylaxis associated with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: Approach to allergy investigation.,"Reports about cases of anaphylaxis to mRNA vaccines have created anxiety in the community and could increase vaccine hesitancy in the population. There are no standardized protocols for allergy testing to mRNA vaccines. PEG is currently the only excipient in both vaccines with recognized allergenic potential. Allergy to PEG has been reported with increasing frequency over recent years, often in patients who had repeated systemic allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to several classes of drugs before diagnosis. Proposed protocols are based on current knowledge about potential mechanisms of anaphylaxis associated with the mRNA vaccines, and the assumption that polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the most likely culprit. Allergy testing to PEGs and mRNA vaccines is complex and carries the risk of anaphylaxis and should be conducted in a specialist drug allergy center. Appropriate PEG-free emergency medical treatment and supervision should be readily available."
8215,Viability of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal bio-aerosols.,"I read with interest the rapid review by Gupta and colleagues [1] concerning the incidence and timing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) positive faecal samples in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). The authors acknowledge insufficient evidence in support of transmission via faeco‐oral route and identify the need for further research regarding the viability of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the context of human faeces. However, it is equally pertinent to consider the viability of the virus in faecal bio‐aerosols generated by toilet plumes [2]."
8216,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infections in Children: Multicenter Surveillance, United States, January-March 2020.","Previous reports of coronavirus disease 2019 among children in the United States have been based on health jurisdiction reporting. We performed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing on children enrolled in active, prospective, multicenter surveillance during January-March 2020. Among 3187 children, only 4 (0.1%) SARS-CoV-2-positive cases were identified March 20-31 despite evidence of rising community circulation."
8217,Pooled testing for COVID-19 diagnosis by real-time RT-PCR: A multi-site comparative evaluation of 5- & 10-sample pooling.,"Background & objectives: Public health and diagnostic laboratories are facing huge sample loads for COVID-19 diagnosis by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). High sensitivity of optimized real-time RT-PCR assays makes pooled testing a potentially efficient strategy for resource utilization when positivity rates for particular regions or groups of individuals are low. We report here a comparative analysis of pooled testing for 5- and 10-sample pools by real-time RT-PCR across 10 COVID-19 testing laboratories in India. Methods: Ten virus research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDLs) testing for COVID-19 by real-time RT-PCR participated in this evaluation. At each laboratory, 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples including 10 positive samples were used to create 5- and 10-sample pools with one positive sample in each pool. RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2-specific E gene target were performed for individual positive samples as well as pooled samples. Concordance between individual sample testing and testing in the 5- or 10-sample pools was calculated, and the variation across sites and by sample cycle threshold (Ct) values was analyzed. Results: A total of 110 each of 5- and 10-sample pools were evaluated. Concordance between the 5-sample pool and individual sample testing was 100 per cent in the Ct value ≤30 cycles and 95.5 per cent for Ctvalues ≤33 cycles. Overall concordance between the 5-sample pooled and individual sample testing was 88 per cent while that between 10-sample pool and individual sample testing was 66 per cent. Although the concordance rates for both the 5- and 10-sample pooled testing varied across laboratories, yet for samples with Ct values ≤33 cycles, the concordance was ≥90 per cent across all laboratories for the 5-sample pools. Interpretation & conclusions: Results from this multi-site assessment suggest that pooling five samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time RT-PCR may be an acceptable strategy without much loss of sensitivity even for low viral loads, while with 10-sample pools, there may be considerably higher numbers of false negatives. However, testing laboratories should perform validations with the specific RNA extraction and RT-PCR kits in use at their centres before initiating pooled testing."
8218,COVID-19 Pandemic Planning: Simulation Models to Predict Biochemistry Test Capacity for Patient Surges.,"Background: Patient surges beyond hospital capacity during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic emphasized a need for clinical laboratories to prepare test processes to support future patient care. The objective of this study was to determine if current instrumentation in local hospital laboratories can accommodate the anticipated workload from COVID-19 infected patients in hospitals and a proposed field hospital in addition to testing for non-infected patients. Methods: Simulation models predicted instrument throughput and turn-around-time for chemistry, ion-selective-electrode, and immunoassay tests using vendor-developed software with different workload scenarios. The expanded workload included tests from anticipated COVID patients in 2 local hospitals and a proposed field hospital with a COVID-specific test menu in addition to the pre-pandemic workload. Results: Instrumentation throughput and turn-around time at each site was predicted. With additional COVID-patient beds in each hospital, the maximum throughput was approached with no impact on turnaround time. Addition of the field hospital workload led to significantly increased test turnaround times at each site. Conclusions: Simulation models depicted the analytic capacity and turn-around times for laboratory tests at each site and identified the laboratory best suited for field hospital laboratory support during the pandemic."
8219,Molecular biology of the SARs-CoV-2 spike protein: A review of current knowledge.,"The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an unprecedented worldwide public health emergency. Despite the concerted efforts of the scientific field, by April 25, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 had spread to over 192 countries/regions, causing more than 146 million confirmed cases including 31 million deaths. For now, an established treatment for patients with COVID-19 remains unavailable. The key to tackling this pandemic is to understand the mechanisms underlying its infectivity and pathogenicity. As a predominant focus, the coronavirus spike (S) protein is the key determinant of host range, infectivity, and pathogenesis. Thereby comprehensive understanding of the sophisticated structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein may provide insights into possible intervention strategies to fight this ongoing global pandemic. Herein, we summarize the current knowledge of the molecular structural and functional features of SARS-CoV-2 S protein as well as recent updates on the cell entry mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for exploring more structure-guided strategies against SARS-CoV-2."
