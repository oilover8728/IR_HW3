9990,Adverse Consequences of Rushing a SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine: Implications for Public Trust.,
9991,How mobility habits influenced the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the Italian case study.,"Starting from December 2019 the world has faced an unprecedented health crisis caused by the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) due to the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Within this topic, the aim of the paper was to quantify the effect of mobility habits in the spread of the Coronavirus in Italy through a multiple linear regression model. Estimation results showed that mobility habits represent one of the variables that explains the number of COVID-19 infections jointly with the number of tests/day and some environmental variables (i.e. PM pollution and temperature). Nevertheless, a proximity variable to the first outbreak was also significant, meaning that the areas close to the outbreak had a higher risk of contagion, especially in the initial stage of infection (time-decay phenomena). Furthermore, the number of daily new cases was related to the trips performed three weeks before. This threshold of 21 days could be considered as a sort of positivity detection time, meaning that the mobility restrictions quarantine commonly set at 14 days, defined only according to incubation-based epidemiological considerations, is underestimated (possible delays between contagion and detection) as a containment policy and may not always contribute to effectively slowing down the spread of virus worldwide. This result is original and, if confirmed in other studies, will lay the groundwork for more effective containment of COVID-19 in countries that are still in the health emergency, as well as for possible future returns of the virus."
9992,"Safety, tolerability, and clinical outcomes of hydroxychloroquine for hospitalized patients with coronavirus 2019 disease.","Background: Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a devastating worldwide pandemic. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but clinical data supporting HCQ for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received â‰¥1 dose of HCQ at two New York City hospitals. We measured incident Grade 3 or 4 blood count and liver test abnormalities, ventricular arrhythmias, and vomiting and diarrhea within 10 days after HCQ initiation, and the proportion of patients who completed HCQ therapy. We also describe changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment hypoxia scores between baseline and day 10 after HCQ initiation and in-hospital mortality. Results: None of the 153 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received HCQ developed a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Incident blood count and liver test abnormalities occurred in <15% of patients and incident vomiting or diarrhea was rare. Eighty-nine percent of patients completed their HCQ course and three patients discontinued therapy because of QT prolongation. Fifty-two percent of patients had improved hypoxia scores 10 days after starting HCQ. Thirty-one percent of patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of HCQ initiation died during their hospitalization, compared to 18% of patients who were receiving supplemental oxygen but not requiring mechanical ventilation, and 8% of patients who were not requiring supplemental oxygen. Co-administration of azithromycin was not associated with improved outcomes. Conclusions: HCQ appears to be reasonably safe and tolerable in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, nearly one-half of patients did not improve with this treatment, highlighting the need to evaluate HCQ and alternate therapies in randomized trials."
9993,Skin manifestations of COVID-19 in children: Part 1.,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The initial recognized symptoms were respiratory, sometimes culminating in severe respiratory distress requiring ventilation, and causing death in a percentage of those infected. As time has passed, other symptoms have been recognized. The initial reports of cutaneous manifestations were from Italian dermatologists, probably because Italy was the first European country to be heavily affected by the pandemic. The overall clinical presentation, course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children differ from those in adults as do the cutaneous manifestations of childhood. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in children after thorough and critical review of articles published in the literature and from the personal experience of a large panel of paediatric dermatologists in Europe. In Part 1, we discuss one of the first and most widespread cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19, chilblain-like lesions. In Part 2, we review other manifestations, including erythema multiforme, urticaria and Kawasaki disease-like inflammatory multisystemic syndrome, while in Part 3, we discuss the histological findings of COVID-19 manifestations, and the testing and management of infected children, for both COVID-19 and any other pre-existing conditions."
9994,Correlation between travellers departing from Wuhan before the Spring Festival and subsequent spread of COVID-19 to all provinces in China.,"We found a strong correlation between travel volumes departing from Wuhan, Hubei Province before the Spring Festival and the extent of amplification of the outbreak of COVID-19 in China in 2020, with 100 top cities. Almost 70% of exportations were within cities in Hubei province."
9995,Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy.,"The outbreak of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly become a public health emergency of international concern, especially affecting the elderly people and patients with chronic disease, such as hypertension and respiratory syndromes. Patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment (e.g., bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, monoclonal antibodies, and paclitaxel therapy) are vulnerable to the development of respiratory syndromes induced by chemotherapeutic agents and are also more susceptible to viral infections as they are immunosuppressed. Neutropenia is an important risk factor for increased vulnerability to infections, as a respiratory syndrome involves an array of immune cells maintaining the balance between pathogen clearance and immunopathology. However, the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms in cancer patients is broad, with complications being related to the malignancy itself, treatment toxicity, and infections. The risk factors depend on the specific type of cancer, chemotherapy, patient characteristics, and comorbidities. Thus, this review discusses the main events implicated in immunosuppression caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy and the association of immunosuppression and other factors with SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility in cancer patients; and, importantly, how to deal with this situation in face of the current pandemic scenario."
9996,Prevention and therapy of SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.351 variant in mice.,"Improving clinical care for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants is a global health priority. Small-molecule antivirals like remdesivir (RDV) and biologics such as human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is not known whether combination RDV/mAb will improve outcomes over single-agent therapies or whether antibody therapies will remain efficacious against variants. Here, we show that a combination of two mAbs in clinical trials, C144 and C135, have potent antiviral effects against even when initiated 48 h after infection and have therapeutic efficacy in vivo against the B.1.351 variant of concern (VOC). Combining RDV and antibodies provided a modest improvement in outcomes compared with single agents. These data support the continued use of RDV to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections and the continued clinical development of the C144 and C135 antibody combination to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants."
9997,Chest Radiograph (CXR) Manifestations of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Mini-review.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and has claimed more than one million lives, besides causing hardship and disruptions. The Fleischner Society has recommended chest X-ray (CXR) in detecting cases at high risk of disease progression, for triaging suspected patients with moderate-to-severe illness, and for eliminating false negatives in areas with high pre-test probability or limited resources. Although CXR is less sensitive than real-- time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in detecting mild COVID-19, it is nevertheless useful because of equipment portability, low cost and practicality in serial assessments of disease progression among hospitalized patients. Objective: This study aims to review the typical and relatively atypical CXR manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital. Methods: The CXRs of 136 COVID-19 patients confirmed through real-time RT-PCR from March to May 2020 were reviewed. A literature search was performed using PubMed. Results: A total of 54 patients had abnormal CXR whilst the others were normal. Typical CXR findings included pulmonary consolidation or ground-glass opacities in a multifocal, bilateral peripheral, or lower zone distribution, whereas atypical CXR features comprised cavitation and pleural effusion. Conclusion: Typical findings of COVID-19 infection in chest computed tomography studies can also be seen in CXR. The presence of atypical features associated with worse disease outcome. Recognition of these features on CXR will improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosing COVID-19 patients."
9998,The evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on ocular surface.,"This is a cross-sectional study of patients who received a COVID-19 diagnosis between December 30, 2019 and February 7, 2020 at Tongji Hospital. A total of 102 patients (48 Male [47%] and 54 Female [53%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) were confirmed to have COVID-19 by laboratory diagnosis with a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis were identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Of those two patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were found in ocular discharges by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in only one patient. Our findings suspect the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, while the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. To lower the SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial infection, all health care professionals should wear protective goggles. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-CoV-2."
9999,Fighting the War Against COVID-19 via Cell-Based Regenerative Medicine: Lessons Learned from 1918 Spanish Flu and Other Previous Pandemics.,"The human population is in the midst of battling a rapidly-spreading virus- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. Despite the resurgences in positive cases after reopening businesses in May, the country is seeing a shift in mindset surrounding the pandemic as people have been eagerly trickling out from federally-mandated quarantine into restaurants, bars, and gyms across America. History can teach us about the past, and today's pandemic is no exception. Without a vaccine available, three lessons from the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic may arm us in our fight against COVID-19. First, those who survived the first wave developed immunity to the second wave, highlighting the potential of passive immunity-based treatments like convalescent plasma and cell-based therapy. Second, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 are unknown. Slow-progressive cases of the Spanish flu have been linked to bacterial pneumonia and neurological disorders later in life, emphasizing the need to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Third, the Spanish flu killed approximately 17 to 50 million people, and the lack of human response, overcrowding, and poor hygiene were key in promoting the spread and high mortality. Human behavior is the most important strategy for preventing the virus spread and we must adhere to proper precautions. This review will cover our current understanding of the pathology and treatment for COVID-19 and highlight similarities between past pandemics. By revisiting history, we hope to emphasize the importance of human behavior and innovative therapies as we wait for the development of a vaccine. Graphical Abstract."
