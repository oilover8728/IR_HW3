7620,Review of COVID-19 Antibody Therapies.,"In the global health emergency caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), efficient and specific therapies are urgently needed. Compared with traditional small-molecular drugs, antibody therapies are relatively easy to develop; they are as specific as vaccines in targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); and they have thus attracted much attention in the past few months. This article reviews seven existing antibodies for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 with 3D structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Five 3D antibody structures associated with the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein are also evaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions of these antibodies with the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are compared with those between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and RBD complexes. Due to the orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental binding affinities, we introduce topological data analysis, a variety of network models, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeutic potential of the 14 antibody-antigen complexes. The current COVID-19 antibody clinical trials, which are not limited to the S protein target, are also reviewed."
7621,"A description of events surrounding the index COVID-19 diagnosis in a staff member at Kalafong Provincial Tertiary Hospital in Gauteng, South Africa.","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presented a huge challenge to the health systems across the world. When the virus hit South Africa, and the state of national disaster was announced by the president, the healthcare system had to work on its COVID-19 response preparedness. Initially, a few hospitals were then designated facilities for managing COVID-19 patients. Kalafong Hospital, which was not amongst a list of designated facilities for COVID-19 was forced to evaluate its level of preparedness after an intern doctor tested positive. The objectives of this report are to illustrate the hospital's response around the management of the index case to share our facility's general response to the pandemic."
7622,Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike responses to Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines by previous infection status.,"Objectives: We investigated determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) anti-spike IgG responses in healthcare workers (HCWs) following one or two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. Methods: HCWs participating in regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were invited for serological testing prior to first and second vaccination, and 4 weeks post-vaccination if receiving a 12-week dosing interval. Quantitative post-vaccination anti-spike antibody responses were measured using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (detection threshold: â‰¥50 AU/mL). We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of seropositivity and generalized additive models to track antibody responses over time. Results: 3570/3610 HCWs (98.9%) were seropositive >14 days post first vaccination and prior to second vaccination: 2706/2720 (99.5%) were seropositive after the Pfizer-BioNTech and 864/890 (97.1%) following the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. Previously infected and younger HCWs were more likely to test seropositive post first vaccination, with no evidence of differences by sex or ethnicity. All 470 HCWs tested >14 days after the second vaccination were seropositive. Quantitative antibody responses were higher after previous infection: median (IQR) >21 days post first Pfizer-BioNTech 14 604 (7644-22 291) AU/mL versus 1028 (564-1985) AU/mL without prior infection (p < 0.001). Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine recipients had lower readings post first dose than Pfizer-BioNTech recipients, with and without previous infection, 10 095 (5354-17 096) and 435 (203-962) AU/mL respectively (both p < 0.001 versus Pfizer-BioNTech). Antibody responses >21 days post second Pfizer vaccination in those not previously infected, 10 058 (6408-15 582) AU/mL, were similar to those after prior infection followed by one vaccine dose. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination leads to detectable anti-spike antibodies in nearly all adult HCWs. Whether differences in response impact vaccine efficacy needs further study."
7623,Harnessing co-operative immune augmentation by contact allergens to enhance the efficacy of viral vaccines.,"Although the development of successful vaccines against coronaviruses may be achieved, for some individuals the immune response that they stimulate may prove to be insufficient for effective host defence. The principle that a relatively strong contact allergen will have an enhancing effect on sensitization compared with a less potent contact allergen if they are co-administered, may not, at first, appear relevant to this issue. However, this augmentation effect is thought to be due to the sharing of common or complementary pathways. Here, we briefly consider aspects of the shared and complementary pathways between skin sensitization induced by exposure to a contact allergen and the immune response to viruses, with particular reference to COVID-19. The relationship leads us to explore whether this principle, which we name here as ""co-operative immune augmentation"" may be extended to include viral vaccination. We consider evidence that even relatively weak contact allergens, used in vaccines for other purposes, can show enhanced sensitization, which is in keeping with a co-operative augmentation principle. Finally, we consider how the potent contact allergen diphenylcyclopropenone could be employed safely as an enhancer of vaccine responses."
7624,Strategies at points of entry to reduce importation risk of COVID-19 cases and reopen travel.,"Background: With more countries exiting lockdown, public health safety requires screening measures at international travel entry points that can prevent the reintroduction or importation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2. Here, we estimate the number of cases captured, quarantining days averted and secondary cases expected to occur with screening interventions. Methods: To estimate active case exportation risk from 153 countries with recorded coronavirus disease-2019 cases and deaths, we created a simple data-driven framework to calculate the number of infectious and upcoming infectious individuals out of 100 000 000 potential travellers from each country, and assessed six importation risk reduction strategies; Strategy 1 (S1) has no screening on entry, S2 tests all travellers and isolates test-positives where those who test negative at 7 days are permitted entry, S3 the equivalent but for a 14 day period, S4 quarantines all travellers for 7 days where all are subsequently permitted entry, S5 the equivalent for 14 days and S6 the testing of all travellers and prevention of entry for those who test positive. Results: The average reduction in case importation across countries relative to S1 is 90.2% for S2, 91.7% for S3, 55.4% for S4, 91.2% for S5 and 77.2% for S6. An average of 79.6% of infected travellers are infectious upon arrival. For the top 100 exporting countries, an 88.2% average reduction in secondary cases is expected through S2 with the 7-day isolation of test-positives, increasing to 92.1% for S3 for 14-day isolation. A substantially smaller reduction of 30.0% is expected for 7-day all traveller quarantining, increasing to 84.3% for 14-day all traveller quarantining. Conclusions: The testing and isolation of test-positives should be implemented provided good testing practices are in place. If testing is not feasible, quarantining for a minimum of 14 days is recommended with strict adherence measures in place."
7625,"Breakthrough Infections of SARS-CoV-2 Gamma Variant in Fully Vaccinated Gold Miners, French Guiana, 2021.","An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 caused by the Gamma variant of concern infected 24/44 (55%) employees of a gold mine in French Guiana (87% symptomatic, no severe forms). The attack rate was 60% (15/25) among fully vaccinated miners and 75% (3/4) among unvaccinated miners without a history of infection."
7626,"Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from lineages B.1.1.7 (Alpha), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.110 by heating and UV irradiation.","Currently, the rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is related to G clade (including GH, GR, GRY and GV clades), which are associated with more than 98 % of sequenced viral isolates worldwide. The unprecedented velocity of spread of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak represents a critical need for prevention strategies. Vaccines are recently being available and antiviral drugs have shown limited efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Thus, it is needed to know how to reduce the infectivity of the virus by different physicochemical conditions in order to prevent exposure to contaminated material. This work describes heating and irradiating UV-C light procedures to reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 belonging to different three lineages. Results of physicochemical treatment showed no differences among viral lineages. Analytical conditions for efficient inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 were determined."
7627,Virus-CKB: an integrated bioinformatics platform and analysis resource for COVID-19 research.,"Given the scale and rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need for medicines that can help before vaccines are available. In this study, we present a viral-associated disease-specific chemogenomics knowledgebase (Virus-CKB) and apply our computational systems pharmacology-target mapping to rapidly predict the FDA-approved drugs which can quickly progress into clinical trials to meet the urgent demand of the COVID-19 outbreak. Virus-CKB reuses the underlying platform of our DAKB-GPCRs but adds new features like multiple-compound support, multi-cavity protein support and customizable symbol display. Our one-stop computing platform describes the chemical molecules, genes and proteins involved in viral-associated diseases regulation. To date, Virus-CKB archived 65 antiviral drugs in the market, 107 viral-related targets with 189 available 3D crystal or cryo-EM structures and 2698 chemical agents reported for these target proteins. Moreover, Virus-CKB is implemented with web applications for the prediction of the relevant protein targets and analysis and visualization of the outputs, including HTDocking, TargetHunter, BBB predictor, NGL Viewer, Spider Plot, etc. The Virus-CKB server is accessible at https://www.cbligand.org/g/virus-ckb."
7628,Clinical predictors and timing of cessation of viral RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19.,"Background: Molecular detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is key in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been widely used for followup of cases as a proxy for contagiousness. The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in the context of clinical features and comorbidities is understudied. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 adult symptomatic cases at Mayo Clinic, eventually achieving cessation of viral RNA shedding (CVS), defined as two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR results on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at least 24 h apart. Results: A total of 251 patients were included, median age was 53 years and 59 % female. The most common symptoms at diagnosis were cough, myalgia, dyspnea, fever and chills. Myalgia, cough, anosmia, ageusia and sore throat were common at CVS, but fever and dyspnea were not observed. The median time from symptom onset to CVS was 23 days, and did not differ by symptoms. The weekly cumulative CVS rate was 2, 14, 44, 73, 91 and 95 % at 1-6 weeks from symptom onset, respectively. Cough and fever were associated with a positive PCR test if tested within 2 weeks of symptoms (P < 0.05). Patients with asthma or immunosuppression were less likely to achieve CVS if tested 3 weeks into symptoms (P < 0.04). Conclusions: The cumulative CVS rate at 3 weeks from symptom-onset is 44 % in our entire cohort. The findings of our study highlight the low yield of repeating a SARS-CoV-2 NP PCR test within 21 days of a laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 diagnosis."
7629,The impact of COVID-19 vaccination delay: A data-driven modeling analysis for Chicago and New York City.,"Background: By the beginning of December 2020, some vaccines against COVID-19 already presented efficacy and security, which qualify them to be used in mass vaccination campaigns. Thus, setting up strategies of vaccination became crucial to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We use daily COVID-19 reports from Chicago and New York City (NYC) from 01-Mar2020 to 28-Nov-2020 to estimate the parameters of an SEIR-like epidemiological model that accounts for different severity levels. To achieve data adherent predictions, we let the model parameters to be time-dependent. The model is used to forecast different vaccination scenarios, where the campaign starts at different dates, from 01-Oct-2020 to 01-Apr-2021. To generate realistic scenarios, disease control strategies are implemented whenever the number of predicted daily hospitalizations reaches a preset threshold. Results: The model reproduces the empirical data with remarkable accuracy. Delaying the vaccination severely affects the mortality, hospitalization, and recovery projections. In Chicago, the disease spread was under control, reducing the mortality increment as the start of the vaccination was postponed. In NYC, the number of cases was increasing, thus, the estimated model predicted a much larger impact, despite the implementation of contention measures. The earlier the vaccination campaign begins, the larger is its potential impact in reducing the COVID-19 cases, as well as in the hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, the rate at which cases, hospitalizations and deaths increase with the delay in the vaccination beginning strongly depends on the shape of the incidence of infection in each city."
