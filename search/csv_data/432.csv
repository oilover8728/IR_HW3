4310,Dynamic Chest CT Evaluation in Three Cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia.,"A recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). There have been some reports of imaging findings regarding the disease's characteristic features. Here, we report three cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with dynamic pulmonary CT evaluation. The CT scan showed multiple regions of ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation in COVID-19 patients and the CT scan was useful in tracking the progression or regression of COVID-19."

4312,Outcomes Among Patients with Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Infection After Vaccination.,"Background: Breakthrough infections after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported. Clinical outcomes in these persons are not widely known. Methods: We evaluated all vaccinated persons with breakthrough infection ≥14 days after the second vaccine dose and unvaccinated controls matched on age, sex, nationality, and reason for testing between December 23, 2020 and March 28, 2021 in Qatar. Our primary outcome was severe disease defined as hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Among 456 persons cases of breakthrough infection and 456 unvaccinated matched controls with confirmed infection, median age was 45 years, 60.7% were males, and ≥1 comorbid condition was present in 61.2% of the vaccinated and 47.8% of the unvaccinated persons (P=0.009). Severe disease was recorded in 48 (10.5%) of the vaccinated and 121 (26.5%) of the unvaccinated group (P<0.001). Factors associated with severe disease included increasing age (HR vs. <40 years old: >40-60 years, HR 2.32; >60-70 years, HR 4.34; >70 years, HR 5.43); presence of symptoms at baseline (HR 2.42, 95%CI 1.44-4.07); and being unvaccinated (HR 2.84, 95%CI 1.80-4.47). Conclusions: In persons with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, increasing age is associated with a higher risk of severe disease or death, while vaccination is associated with a lower risk. Presence of comorbidities was not associated with severe disease or death among persons with breakthrough infection."

Comparing the deaths by natural causes expected and the excess mortality rate, there is a 22% increase in deaths mainly of male patients and individuals over 60 years old."
4315,SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Mutations and Escape from Antibodies: A Computational Model of Epitope Loss in Variants of Concern.,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is exposed on the viral surface and is the first point of contact between the virus and the host. For these reasons it represents the prime target for Covid-19 vaccines. In recent months, variants of this protein have started to emerge. Their ability to reduce or evade recognition by S-targeting antibodies poses a threat to immunological treatments and raises concerns for their consequences on vaccine efficacy. To develop a model able to predict the potential impact of S-protein mutations on antibody binding sites, we performed unbiased multi-microsecond molecular dynamics of several glycosylated S-protein variants and applied a straightforward structure-dynamics-energy based strategy to predict potential changes in immunogenic regions on each variant. We recover known epitopes on the reference D614G sequence. By comparing our results, obtained on isolated S-proteins in solution, to recently published data on antibody binding and reactivity in new S variants, we directly show that modifications in the S-protein consistently translate into the loss of potentially immunoreactive regions. Our findings can thus be qualitatively reconnected to the experimentally characterized decreased ability of some of the Abs elicited against the dominant S-sequence to recognize variants. While based on the study of SARS-CoV-2 spike variants, our computational epitope-prediction strategy is portable and could be applied to study immunoreactivity in mutants of proteins of interest whose structures have been characterized, helping the development/selection of vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants."
4316,Acceptance of a vaccine against COVID-19 - a systematic review of surveys conducted worldwide.,"Objectives: The most promising strategy for managing COVID-19 pandemic is achieving sufficient vaccination rate worldwide. The question is how many people will be willing to get vaccinated. Study design: We systematically reviewed peer-reviewed manuscripts monitoring people´s intention to receive a vaccine against COVID-19. Methods: Up to December 28, 2020 we identified 62 relevant peer-reviewed articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and GoogleScholar. Results: Total sample size was 118 855 respondents with overall average COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate of 72.5% which is ""just"" the level estimated to be sufficient for reaching herd immunity threshold. Surprisingly, healthcare workers showed smaller interest in receiving the vaccine when compared to general adult population and university students. On the other hand, their attitude to vaccination did not change over time. In case of general adult population, the longer the pandemic lasts, the smaller proportion of population wants to get vaccinated. Vaccination intentions were independent of gross domestic product and human development index. Conclusion: Willingness of population to receive COVID-19 is just at the herd immunity threshold and it is decreasing over time (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 110). Keywords: vaccination, survey, COVID-19, pandemic, review."
4317,COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake and Intent Among Emergency Healthcare Workers: A Cross-Sectional Survey.,"Objective: Vaccine hesitancy limits population protection from SARS-CoV (coronavirus disease [COVID-19]). Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers (HCW) could put patients and coworkers at risk. Methods: We surveyed 475 emergency department and emergency medical service workers from January to February 2021 to determine vaccine intent/uptake, perceived COVID-19 vulnerability, and factors associated with vaccine intent/uptake. Results: Although 79% of HCWs received or had plans to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, 21% had no intent/were unvaccinated; intent/uptake was lower among females (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34) and those with a history of COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.55), and higher among those with advanced degrees (OR = 3.53) and high perceived COVID-19 vulnerability (OR = 1.99). Conclusions: This study provides a timely assessment of vaccination status among frontline HCWs and highlights subgroups who may be at high risk of exposure and transmission."
4318,COVID-19 and Preparing Planetary Health for Future Ecological Crises: Hopes from Glycomics for Vaccine Innovation.,"A key lesson emerging from COVID-19 is that pandemic proofing planetary health against future ecological crises calls for systems science and preventive medicine innovations. With greater proximity of the human and animal natural habitats in the 21st century, it is also noteworthy that zoonotic infections such as COVID-19 that jump from animals to humans are increasingly plausible in the coming decades. In this context, glycomics technologies and the third alphabet of life, the sugar code, offer veritable prospects to move omics systems science from discovery to diverse applications of relevance to global public health and preventive medicine. In this expert review, we discuss the science of glycomics, its importance in vaccine development, and the recent progress toward discoveries on the sugar code that can help prevent future infectious outbreaks that are looming on the horizon in the 21st century. Glycomics offers veritable prospects to boost planetary health, not to mention the global scientific capacity for vaccine innovation against novel and existing infectious agents."
