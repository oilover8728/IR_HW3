8390,Adjusting extracellular pH to prevent entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells.,"The frequent outbreaks of life-threatening RNA viruses, including the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pose tremendous challenges to humanity. The author proposes that creating a more alkaline extracellular environment that is unsuitable for the fusion between the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 and the host cell membrane is a promising method to prevent the entry of coronaviruses into human cells. The alkaline environment could be achieved by exposing the general public to water-clustered negative air ions (NAIs), both indoors and outdoors, to induce a gradual increase in the pH of the human body. Previous studies have demonstrated that there are no harmful effects of high-concentration NAIs on human health."
8391,Ethical Considerations in Chemotherapy and Vaccines in Cancer Patients in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 situation is a worldwide health emergency with strong implications in clinical oncology. In this viewpoint, we address two crucial dilemmas from the ethical dimension: (1) Is it ethical to postpone or suspend cancer treatments which offer a statistically significant benefit in quality of life and survival in cancer patients during this time of pandemic?; (2) Should we vaccinate cancer patients against COVID-19 if scientific studies have not included this subgroup of patients? Regarding the first question, the best available evidence applied to the ethical principles of Beauchamp and Childress shows that treatments (such as chemotherapy) with clinical benefit are fair and beneficial. Indeed, the suspension or delay of such treatments should be considered malefic. Regarding the second question, applying the doctrine of double-effect, we show that the potential beneficial effect of vaccines in the population with cancer (or those one that has had cancer) is much higher than the potential adverse effects of these vaccines. In addition, there is no better and less harmful known solution."
8392,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Japan during a COVID-19 outbreak.,"The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater samples has been documented in several countries. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is potentially effective for early warning of a COVID-19 outbreak. In this study, presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples was investigated and was compared with the number of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the study area during COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. In total, 45 influent wastewater samples were collected from five wastewater treatment plants in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures in Japan. During the study period, the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in these prefectures increased from 0.3 and 0 to >20 per 100,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the samples was detected using several PCR-based assays. Of the 45 samples, 21 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 according to at least one of the three quantitative RT-PCR assays. The detection frequency increased when the number of total confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in 100,000 people exceeded 10 in each prefecture; however, SARS-CoV-2 could also be detected at a low frequency even when the number was below 1.0. SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater could be detected in the early stage of the epidemic, even if the number of confirmed cases potentially underestimates the actual numbers of cases. This suggests that WBE approach can potentially act as an early warning of COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan."
8393,The calm after the storm: re-starting ART treatments safely in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a significant impact on medically assisted reproduction (MAR) services. ESHRE decided to mobilize resources in order to collect, analyse, monitor, prepare and disseminate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) knowledge specifically related to ART and early pregnancy. This article presents the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic focusing on reproductive healthcare. It details the rationale behind the guidance prepared to support MAR services in organizing and managing the re-start of treatments or in case of any future wave of COVID-19 disease. The guidance includes information on patient selection and informed consent, staff and patient triage and testing, adaptation of ART services, treatment planning and code of conduct. The initiatives detailed in this article are not necessarily COVID-specific and such action plans could be applied effectively to manage similar emergency situations in different areas of medicine, in the future."
8394,2020 Year in Review: Pharmacologic Treatments for COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has led to a pandemic of acute respiratory illness. Pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 have included treatments that target infection prevention, prevention of viral replication, reduce inflammation, and manage symptoms of respiratory failure caused by the disease. This is a review of key pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 based on peer-reviewed articles from 2020."
8395,Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 mutations reveals regional-specificity and similar trends of N501 and high-frequency mutation N501Y in different levels of control measures.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has spread globally, causing more than 161.5 million cases and 3.3 million deaths to date. Surveillance and monitoring of new mutations in the virus' genome are crucial to our understanding of the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, how the temporal dynamics of these mutations is influenced by control measures and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is poorly understood. Using 1,058,020 SARS-CoV-2 from sequenced COVID-19 cases from 98 countries (totaling 714 country-month combinations), we perform a normalization by COVID-19 cases to calculate the relative frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and explore their dynamics over time. We found 115 mutations estimated to be present in more than 3% of global COVID-19 cases and determined three types of mutation dynamics: high-frequency, medium-frequency, and low-frequency. Classification of mutations based on temporal dynamics enable us to examine viral adaptation and evaluate the effects of implemented control measures in virus evolution during the pandemic. We showed that medium-frequency mutations are characterized by high prevalence in specific regions and/or in constant competition with other mutations in several regions. Finally, taking N501Y mutation as representative of high-frequency mutations, we showed that level of control measure stringency negatively correlates with the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 with high-frequency or not-high-frequency and both follows similar trends in different levels of stringency."
8396,Conserved and Novel Mouse CD8 T Cell Epitopes within SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain Protein Identified following Subunit Vaccination.,"The prior existence of human ACE2 protein-expressing mice used to study SARS-CoV and the rapid development of mouse-adapted virus strains have allowed the study of SARS-CoV-2 in mice, even as we are still learning about its natural pathology in humans. With myriad genetically altered strains on the C57BL/6 background and the abundance of immunological reagents available to interrogate its immune responses, the C57BL/6 mice may provide useful insight into the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. To conduct more detailed studies on their T cell responses to vaccines and infection, the epitopes eliciting those responses must be characterized in further detail. In this study, we mapped CD8 T cell epitopes within the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in C57BL/6 mice. Our study identified five major CD8 T cell epitopes in immunized C57BL/6 mice, including one, VVLSFELL, presented by H-2Kb and common between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2."
8397,Preoperative assessment for scheduling surgery during the coronavirus disease pandemic.,"On Mar 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic. Because COVID-19 has a pre-symptomatic period of up to 2 weeks, SARS-CoV-2 infection has continued to spread. Some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a severe clinical course, while most individuals have mild or moderate symptoms. Because SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via droplets and secretions, anesthesiologists have higher risks of infection, especially during airway management. Therefore, general anesthesia requiring airway management can be a challenging procedure for anesthesiologists. During the pandemic, many elective surgeries have been postponed or cancelled in most affected countries. Recently, the number of elective surgeries is gradually recovering from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, and hence, safe clinical practice and protocols to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission to medical staff should be established. This mini-review focuses on the preoperative assessment and decision with regard to scheduling surgery in elective and emergency cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. A standardized questionnaire and algorithm regarding COVID-19 should be used to assess surgical patients preoperatively as it increases the reproducibility and accuracy of the decision whether to proceed with surgery."
8398,Urticaria and coronavirus infection: a lesson from SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,"Urticaria is a condition involving both skin and mucosal tissues characterized by the presence of wheals and/or angioedema. The acute form has been related to allergic reactions to drugs or foods, interaction with chemicals, or infections. We reviewed the association of urticaria with coronavirus infections. This review was carried out by the use of two search engines for published original articles, employing two key terms correlated to urticaria and viruses: ""urticaria"" and one term linked to each virus. The research of the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 and urticaria produced 18 papers (including a total of 114 cases). Surprisingly, the search for cases of urticaria in patients with SARS-CoV or MERS produced no results. We tried to interpret this discrepancy and attempted to analyze the possible pathogenesis of urticaria lesions in SARS-CoV-2."
8399,Phenotyping long COVID.,Patients who recover from an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection often present with persistent symptoms lasting for months. The cardiopulmonary exercise test profile of those with “long COVID” is suggestive of deconditioning with a tendency to hyperventilation. https://bit.ly/3y8n0Bt
