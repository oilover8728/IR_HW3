8000,Diagnostic efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM test for COVID-19: A meta-analysis.,"The serological testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgM is widely used in the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, its diagnostic efficacy remains unclear. In this study, we searched for diagnostic studies from the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang databases to calculate the pooled diagnostic accuracy measures using bivariate random-effects model meta-analysis. As a result, 22 from a total of 1613 articles, including 2282 patients with SARS-CoV-2 and 1485 healthy persons or patients without SARS-CoV-2, were selected for a meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve of the summary receiver operator curve (SROC) were: (a) 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.90), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and (b) 0.74 (95% CI: 0.65-0.81), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-1.00), and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.97) for IgM. A subgroup analysis among detection methods indicated the sensitivity of IgG and IgM using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were slightly lower than those using gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) and chemiluminescence immunoassay (P > .05). These results showed that the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM had high diagnostic efficiency to assist the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. And, GICA might be used as the preferred method for its accuracy and simplicity."

8002,"Ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of 535 cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a cross-sectional study.","Purpose: To investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China. Methods: A total of 535 COVID-19 patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. Information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, chronic eye diseases, systemic concomitant symptoms, radiologic findings and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by real-time PCR was collected from questionnaires and electronic medical records. Results: Of 535 patients, 27 patients (5.0%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 4 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 5.9 ± 4.5 days (mean [SD]). The other ocular symptoms, including increased conjunctival secretion, ocular pain, photophobia, dry eye and tearing, were also found in patients with conjunctival congestion. Notably, hand-eye contact was independently correlated with conjunctival congestion in COVID-19 patients. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had chronic eye diseases, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.2%), xerophthalmia (24, 4.5%) and keratitis (14, 2.6%). Similar to the published studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough and fatigue. A total of 343 patients (64.1%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion is one of the COVID-19-related ocular symptoms, which could occur as the initial symptoms. Frequent hand-eye contact may be the risk factor for conjunctival congestion in COVID-19 patients. Screening of patients with conjunctival congestion by ophthalmologists is advocated during the outbreak of COVID-19. It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection."

8004,Storm at the Time of Corona: A Glimpse at the Current Understanding and Therapeutic Opportunities of the SARS-CoV-2 Cytokine Storm.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to severe disease in some cases, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. This severe phenotype seems to be associated with a cytokine storm and immune dysregulation. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes, lymphopenia, and decreased levels of regulatory T cells are some of the immunological features that are seen in patients with SARS-CoV-2. As the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 is influenced by both viral virulence and dysregulated inflammatory response, a combination therapy approach using antiviral drugs plus anti-inflammatory treatments, such as corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies against the IL-6 and IL-1β pathways, and JAK inhibitors are under clinical trials."
8005,A new parameter in COVID-19 pandemic: initial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/Lymphocyte ratio for diagnosis and mortality.,"Background: COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is a pandemic disease, infecting more than 26.5 million people. Since there is no specific and effective treatment; early diagnosis and optimal isolation of the patient are of vital importance. Real-time polymerase chain reaction-based (RT-PCR) analyses do not achieve sufficient sensitivity in the diagnosis of the disease. Methods: The data from 2217 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 and hospitalized or discharged with home isolation were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, comorbidities, PCR results, initial computed tomography (CT), laboratory values, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)/Lymphocyte ratio, initial treatments and last status were recorded. The diagnostic sensitivity of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio, which is the main purpose of the study, was analyzed statistically. Results: In order to test the effectiveness of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio for COVID-19 for diagnostic purposes, CT results were considered as gold standard. The area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.706 (p < 0.001; cut-off > 0.06) (Sensitivity: 76.4, specificity: 59.60). For the evaluation of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio in terms of survival, AUC was found to be 0.749 (p < 0.001; cut-off > 0.21) (Sensitivity: 70.59, specificity: 73.88). Conclusion: Studies based on radiological findings have demonstrated that CT involvement has higher sensitivity. LDH/Lymphocyte ratio was analyzed in terms of diagnosis and mortality with using specific CT involvement as gold standard method which was found to be a more sensitive due to PCR false negativity; 0.06 and 0.21 were obtained as cut off values for diagnosis and mortality."
8006,Kinetics and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: a comparison of 3 different assays.,"Comparing seroprevalence and antibody kinetics in three different commercially available assays for SARS-CoV-2. Serostatus of COVID-19 patients was analyzed 5 months and 10 months after their infection, using three different assays: Diasorin LIAISON, Euroimmun, Abbott Diagnostics ARCHITECT. Seropositivity at baseline differed significantly depending on the assay (Diasorin 81%, Euroimmun 83%, Abbott 59%). At follow-up antibody levels detected in the Diasorin assay were stable, while there was a significant loss in seropositivity in the Euroimmun and Abbott assays. There are significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics based on the specific assay used."
8007,Management of COVID-19 on board the mixed cargo ship Aranui 5.,"Background: During cruises, the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections poses serious organizational problems such as those encountered in 2020 by the Zaandam, the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle or the Diamond Princess. In French Polynesia, the mixed cargo ship Aranui 5 transports both tourists and freight to the Marquesas Islands. The purpose of this article is to show how COVID-19 infections were diagnosed and contained before and after passengers boarded a cruise. Materials and methods: On October 15, 2020, 161 passengers including 80 crew members embarked for a 13-day voyage from Papeete to the Marquesas Islands. Prior to boarding, all passengers underwent a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test; the tests results were all negative. On Day 0, 3, 5, 8 and 11, Biosynex® rapid antigen diagnostic tests were carried out on all or some of the crew members and tourists who may have had contact with new positive cases. Each day, forehead or temporal temperatures were measured using an infrared thermometer and questions were asked concerning the subjects' health status. When a subject was positive, the person and their contacts were isolated in individual cabins. The infected person then left the vessel to be received in a communal reception centre on the nearest island. Results: A total of 9 positive cases were observed, including two before departure (a tourist and a crew member). During the trip, 7 crew members tested positive. The patients and their contacts were isolated and then disembarked at the earliest opportunity. At the time of sampling, the subjects were asymptomatic. The patients and their contacts all became symptomatic within 24 to 48 hours after sampling. Conclusions: In total, the voyage could be completed without any transmission on board among the tourists and with a minimum transmission among the crew members, thus maintaining the tourist and economic activity of the islands during the times of COVID-19 pandemic."

8009,Clinical evaluation of commercial automated SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays.,"Objective: Numerous immunoassays for detecting antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 have been rapidly developed and released. Validations of these have been performed with a limited number of samples. The lack of standardisation might lead to significantly different results. This study compared ten automated assays from six vendors in terms of sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility. Methods: This study compared ten fully automated immunoassays from the following vendors: Diasorin, Epitope Diagnostics, Euroimmun, Roche, YHLO, and Snibe. The retrospective part of the study included patients with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, and controls comprised patients with a suspected infection, in whom the disease was excluded. Furthermore, biobanked sera were taken as negative controls (n = 97). The retrospective part involved four groups: (1) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (n = 183); (1B) suspected COVID-19 infection (n = 167) without a qRT-PCR result but positive serological results from at least two different assays, and suspected COVID-19 infection due to a positive serological result from the Roche assay (n = 295); (2) biobanked sera obtained from patients before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 97) as negative controls; and (2A) probably COVID-19-negative sera with negative serological results from at least two different assays (n = 152). Results: Overall diagnostic sensitivities were: Euroimmun (IgA) 87%; Epitope Diagnostics (IgG) 83%; YHLO (IgG) 77%; Roche (IgM/IgG) 77%; Euroimmun (IgG) 75%; Diasorin (IgG) 53%; Epitope Diagnostics (IgM) 52%; Snibe (IgG) 47%; YHLO (IgM) 35%; and Snibe (IgM) 26%. Diagnostic specificities were: YHLO (IgG) 100%; Roche, 100%; Snibe (IgM/IgG) 100%; Diasorin (IgG) 97%; Euroimmun (IgG) 94%; YHLO (IgM) 94%; Euroimmun (IgA) 83%. Conclusion: Assays from different vendors substantially varied in terms of their performance. These findings might facilitate selection of appropriate serological assays."
