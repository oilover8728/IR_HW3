680,Variant analysis of the first Lebanese SARS-CoV-2 isolates.,"Recently the first genome sequences for 11 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Lebanon became available. Here, we report the detection of variants within the genome of these strains. Pairwise alignment analysis using blastx was performed between these sequences and the UniProtKB data for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to identify amino acid variations. Variants analysis was performed using multiple Bioinformatics tools. We noticed for the first time 18 mutations that have never been reported before. Among those, a frame shift (8651A>) in NSP4, a stop codon 6887A > T in NSP3 and two missense mutations in spike S2 were found. In addition, we found 28 variants in ORF1ab alone. A previously reported variant, 23403A > G, in the spike protein S2 was mostly seen. Two other known mutations 25563G > T in ORF3a and 14408C > T in ORF1ab were detected respectively in 6 and 8 out of the 11 isolates. Our results may help to prognose forthcoming infections in this region."
681,Case Report: Walking Pneumonia in Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Mild Symptoms with Marked Abnormalities on Chest Imaging.,"This case report underlines the appearance of a ""walking pneumonia"" in a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient, with evidence of progressive lung involvement on chest imaging studies. The patient traveled from Wuhan, Hubei, China, to Thailand in January 2020. One of her family members was diagnosed with COVID-19. She presented to the hospital because of her concern, but she was without fever or any respiratory symptoms. Three days earlier, her nasopharyngeal and throat swabs revealed a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Her initial chest radiography was abnormal, and her first sputum SARS-CoV-2 test yielded inconclusive results. A subsequent sputum test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Diagnosis in this patient was facilitated by chest imaging and repeat viral testing. Thus, chest imaging studies might enhance capabilities for early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia."
682,Reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 with patient-collected swabs and saline gargles: A three-headed comparison on multiple molecular platforms.,"With increasing demands for SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as the shortages for testing supplies, collection devices, and trained healthcare workers (HCWs) to collect specimens, self-collection is an attractive prospect to reduce the need for HCWs and expenditure of personal protective equipment. Apart from the traditional nasopharyngeal swab used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, alternative specimens have been validated such as a combined swabs of the oropharynx and anterior nares (OP/N), or throat samples using saline gargles. Both the alternative specimen types are amenable to self-collection. Objectives. This study aimed to compare the sensitivity of HCW-collected (OP/N) swabs, self-collected OP/N swabs, and self-collected saline gargles. Among 38 individuals previously testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (or their close contacts), two self-collected specimen types (OP/N and saline gargles) were compared to HCW-collected OP/N swabs. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed on three molecular assays: a laboratory-developed test (LDT), and two commercial assays on automated platforms: Cobas 6800 (Roche Diagnostics) and Panther (Hologic). The sensitivity of self-collected OP/N swabs was equivalent to healthcare worker (HCW)-collected OP/N swabs at 100.0 % [92.6%-100.0%] for all three molecular tests. The sensitivity of saline gargles was not significantly different than HCW-collected OP/N swabs, but varied slightly between instruments at 93.8 % [85.9%-93.8%] for the LDT, 96.8 % [88.6%-96.8%] for the Cobas assay, and 96.7 % [89.2%-96.9%] for the Panther assay. Overall, self-collection using OP/N swabs or saline gargles are reasonable alternatives to HCW-based collections for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and could facilitate broader surveillance strategies."
683,"Radiomics-based machine learning differentiates ""ground-glass"" opacities due to COVID-19 from acute non-COVID-19 lung disease.","Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) are a non-specific high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) finding tipically observed in early Coronavirus disesase 19 (COVID-19) pneumonia. However, GGOs are also seen in other acute lung diseases, thus making challenging the differential diagnosis. To this aim, we investigated the performance of a radiomics-based machine learning method to discriminate GGOs due to COVID-19 from those due to other acute lung diseases. Two sets of patients were included: a first set of 28 patients (COVID) diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between March and April 2020 having (a) baseline HRCT at hospital admission and (b) predominant GGOs pattern on HRCT; a second set of 30 patients (nCOVID) showing (a) predominant GGOs pattern on HRCT performed between August 2019 and April 2020 and (b) availability of final diagnosis. Two readers independently segmented GGOs on HRCTs using a semi-automated approach, and radiomics features were extracted using a standard open source software (PyRadiomics). Partial least square (PLS) regression was used as the multivariate machine-learning algorithm. A leave-one-out nested cross-validation was implemented. PLS β-weights of radiomics features, including the 5% features with the largest β-weights in magnitude (top 5%), were obtained. The diagnostic performance of the radiomics model was assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The Youden's test assessed sensitivity and specificity of the classification. A null hypothesis probability threshold of 5% was chosen (p < 0.05). The predictive model delivered an AUC of 0.868 (Youden's index = 0.68, sensitivity = 93%, specificity 75%, p = 4.2 × 10-7). Of the seven features included in the top 5% features, five were texture-related. A radiomics-based machine learning signature showed the potential to accurately differentiate GGOs due to COVID-19 pneumonia from those due to other acute lung diseases. Most of the discriminant radiomics features were texture-related. This approach may assist clinician to adopt the appropriate management early, while improving the triage of patients."
684,Diagnostic accuracy of serological tests and kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to assess the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) serological test methods and the kinetics of antibody positivity. Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. We included articles evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests and the kinetics of antibody positivity. MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, medRxiv and bioRxiv were sources of articles. Methodological qualities of included articles were appraised using QUADAS-2 while Metandi performs bivariate meta-analysis of DTA using a generalized linear mixed-model approach. Stata 14 and Review Manager 5.3 were used for data analysis. The summary sensitivity/specificity of chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) were 92% (95% CI: 86%-95%)/99% (CI: 97%-99%), 86% (CI: 82%-89%)/99% (CI: 98%-100%) and 78% (CI: 71%-83%)/98% (95% CI: 96%-99%), respectively. Moreover, CLIA-based assays produced nearly 100% sensitivity within 11-15 days post-symptom onset (DPSO). Based on antibody type, the sensitivity of ELISA-total antibody, CLIA-IgM/G and CLIA-IgG gauged at 94%, 92% and 92%, respectively. The sensitivity of CLIA-RBD assay reached 96%, while LFIA-S demonstrated the lowest sensitivity, 71% (95% CI: 58%-80%). CLIA assays targeting antibodies against RBD considered the best DTA. The antibody positivity rate increased corresponding with DPSO, but there was some decrement when moving from acute phase to convalescent phase of infection. As immunoglobulin isotope-related DTA was heterogeneous, our data have insufficient evidence to recommend CLIA/ELISA for clinical decision-making, but likely to have comparative advantage over RT-qPCR in certain circumstances and geographic regions."
685,How to interpret and use COVID-19 serology and immunology tests.,"Background: Although molecular tests are considered the reference standard for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics, serological and immunological tests may be useful in specific settings. Objectives: This review summarizes the underlying principles and performance of COVID-19 serological and immunological testing. Sources: Selected peer-reviewed publications on COVID-19 related serology and immunology published between December 2019 and March 2021. Content: Serological tests are highly specific but heterogeneous in their sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19. For certain indications, including delayed disease presentations, serological tests can have added value. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may indicate a recent or past COVID-19 infection. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) antibody tests have the advantages of being easy and fast to perform, but many have a low sensitivity in acute settings. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs) have higher sensitivities. Besides humoral immunity, cellular immunity is also essential for successful host defences against viruses. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays can be used to measure T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in never exposed patients suggests the possibility of cellular immunity induced by other circulating coronaviruses. T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 have also been detected in recovered COVID-19 patients with no detectable antibodies. Implications: Serological and immunological tests are primarily applied for population-based seroprevalence studies to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control measures and increase our understanding of the immunology behind COVID-19. Combining molecular diagnostics with serological tests may optimize the detection of COVID-19. As not all infected patients will develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, assessment of cellular immunity may provide complementary information on whether a patient has been previously infected with COVID-19. More studies are needed to understand the correlations of these serological and immunological parameters with protective immunity, taking into account the different circulating virus variants."

688,Real-life evaluation of a COVID-19 rapid antigen detection test in hospitalized children.,"Rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 are simpler, faster, and less expensive than the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that is currently considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to determine the performance of the PANBIO COVID-19 Ag RAD (Abbott) test, a lateral flow immunoassay that detects the nucleocapsid protein, using as a reference RT-PCR method the Cobas®8800 System (Roche Diagnostics). This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary Children's Hospital and included individuals aged ≤16 years with COVID-19-related symptoms or epidemiological criteria for COVID-19. Two nasopharyngeal samples were collected to perform the PANBIO RAD test and RT-PCR. Of 744 children included, 51 (6.86%) had a positive RT-PCR result. The RAD test detected 42 of 51 PCR-positive children while there were no false-positive results. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 82.35% (95% CI, 71.9%-92.8%) and 100%, respectively. Sensitivity was >95% in symptomatic children. The assay performed poorly in asymptomatically infected children. In agreement with previous studies in adults, the PANBIO RAD test can be useful in screening for COVID-19 in children admitted with symptoms suggestive of the disease, especially in the first days of the illness."
689,False negative rate of COVID-19 PCR testing: a discordant testing analysis.,"Background: COVID-19 is diagnosed via detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR). Performance of many SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR assays is not entirely known due to the lack of a gold standard. We sought to evaluate the false negative rate (FNR) and sensitivity of our laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR targeting the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genes. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR results at the Public Health Laboratory (Alberta, Canada) from January 21 to April 18, 2020 were reviewed to identify patients with an initial negative rtRT-PCR followed by a positive result on repeat testing within 14 days (defined as discordant results). Negative samples from these discordant specimens were re-tested using three alternate rtRT-PCR assays (targeting the E gene and N1/N2 regions of the nucleocapsid genes) to assess for false negative (FN) results. Results: During the time period specified, 95,919 patients (100,001 samples) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 49 patients were found to have discordant results including 49 positive and 52 negative swabs. Repeat testing of 52 negative swabs found five FNs (from five separate patients). Assuming 100% specificity of the diagnostic assay, the FNR and sensitivity in this group of patients with discordant testing was 9.3% (95% CI 1.5-17.0%) and 90.7% (95% CI 82.6-98.9%) respectively. Conclusions: Studies to understand the FNR of routinely used assays are important to confirm adequate clinical performance. In this study, most FN results were due to low amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations in patients with multiple specimens collected during different stages of infection. Post-test clinical evaluation of each patient is advised to ensure that rtRT-PCR results are not the only factor in excluding COVID-19."
