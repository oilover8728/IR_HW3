5431,Label-free optical antibody testing kit based on a self-assembled whispering-gallery-mode microsphere.,"The appearance of antibodies in blood is a critical signal to suggest the infection. A rapid and accurate detection method for the antibody is significant to the disease diagnosis, especially for the epidemic. To this end, a highly sensitive whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical testing kit is designed and fabricated for detecting the specific immunoglobulin antibodies. The key component of the kit is a silica self-assembled microsphere decorated with the nucleocapsid proteins (N-proteins) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. After the N-protein antibody immunoglobulin G (N-IgG) and immunoglobulin M (N-IgM) solutions being injected into the kit, the WGM red-shifts due to the antigen-antibody reaction. The wavelength displacement rates are proportional to the concentrations of these two antibodies from 1 to 100 μg/mL. A good specificity of the kit is demonstrated by the nonspecific human immunoglobulin G (H-IgG) and immunoglobulin M (H-IgM)."
5432,Antibody titres decline 3-month post-vaccination with BNT162b2.,"Several studies reported on the humoral response in subjects having received the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. However, data on the kinetics of antibodies 3 months post-vaccination are currently lacking and are important to drive the future vaccination strategy. The CRO-VAX HCP study is an ongoing multicentre, prospective and interventional study designed to assess the antibody response in a population of healthcare professionals who had received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Two hundred individuals underwent a blood drawn within 2 days before the first vaccine dose. One-hundred and forty-two persons (71%) were categorized as seronegative at baseline while 58 (29%) were seropositive. Samples were then collected after 14, 28, 42, 56, and 90 days. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein were measured in all individuals at different time points. Using a one-compartment kinetics model, the time to maximum concentration was estimated at 36 ± 3 days after the first dose and the estimated half-life of antibodies was 55 days (95% CI: 37-107 days) in seronegative participants. In seropositive participants, the time to maximum concentration was estimated at 24 ± 4 days and the estimated half-life was 80 days (95% CI: 46-303 days). The antibody response was higher in seropositive compared to seronegative participants. In both seropositive and seronegative subjects, a significant antibody decline was observed at 3 months compared to the peak response. Nevertheless, the humoral response remained robust in all participants."

5435,Will Healthcare Workers Accept a COVID-19 Vaccine When It Becomes Available? A Cross-Sectional Study in China.,"Objective: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is currently available. This timely survey was conducted to provide insight into on the willingness of healthcare workers (HCWs)to receive the vaccine and determine the influencing factors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional online survey. An online questionnaire was provided to all participants and they were asked if they would accept a free vaccine. The questionnaire gathered general demographic information, and included the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12); Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaire (MBTI); Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21); and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). The data were collected automatically and electronically. Univariate analysis was done between all the variables and our dependent variable. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to examine and identify the associations between the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine with the associated variables. Results: We collected 505 complete answers. The participants included 269 nurses (53.27%), 206 clinicians (40.79%), 15 administrative staff (2.97%), and 15 other staff (2.97%). Of these, 76.63% declared they would accept the vaccine. The major barriers were concerns about safety, effectiveness, and the rapid mutation in the virus. Moreover, four factors were significantly associated with the willingness to receive the vaccine: (a) ""understanding of the vaccine"" (odds ratio (OR):2.322; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.355 to 3.979); (b) ""worried about experiencing COVID-19"" (OR 1.987; 95% CI: 1.197-3.298); (c) ""flu vaccination in 2020"" (OR 4.730; 95% CI: 2.285 to 9.794); and (d) ""living with elderly individuals"" (OR 1.928; 95% CI: 1.074-3.462). Conclusions: During the vaccination period, there was still hesitation in receiving the vaccine. The results will provide a rationale for the design of future vaccination campaigns and education efforts concerning the vaccine."
5436,Inflammatory and hematologic markers as predictors of severe outcomes in COVID-19 infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: Laboratory testing is commonly performed in patients with COVID-19. Each of the laboratory parameters has potential value for risk stratification and prediction of COVID-19 outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the difference between these parameters in severe and nonsevere disease and to provide the optimal cutoff value for predicting severe disease. Method: We performed a systematic literature search through electronic databases. The variables of interest were serum procalcitonin, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in each group of severity outcomes from COVID-19. Results: There were a total of 4848 patients from 23 studies. Our meta-analysis suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 infections have higher procalcitonin, (mean difference 0.07; 95% CI 0.05-0.10; p < 0.00001), CRP (mean difference 36.88; 95% CI 29.10-44.65; p < 0.00001), D-Dimer (mean difference 0.43; 95% CI 0.31-0.56; p < 0.00001), and LDH (mean difference 102.79; 95% CI 79.10-126.49; p < 0.00001) but lower levels of albumin (mean difference -4.58; 95% CI -5.76 to -3.39; p < 0.00001) than those with nonsevere COVID-19 infections. The cutoff values for the parameters were 0.065 ng/mL for procalcitonin, 38.85 g/L for albumin, 33.55 mg/L for CRP, 0.635 μ/L for D-dimer, and 263.5 U/L for LDH, each with high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests elevated procalcitonin, CRP, D-dimer, and LDH and decreased albumin can be used for predicting severe outcomes in COVID-19."
5437,Clinical Utility of Biosensing Platforms for Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Despite collaborative efforts from all countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been continuing to spread globally, forcing the world into social distancing period, making a special challenge for public healthcare system. Before vaccine widely available, the best approach to manage severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is to achieve highest diagnostic accuracy by improving biosensor efficacy. For SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, intensive attempts have been made by many scientists to ameliorate the drawback of current biosensors of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical diagnosis to offer benefits related to platform proposal, systematic analytical methods, system combination, and miniaturization. This review assesses ongoing research efforts aimed at developing integrated diagnostic tools to detect RNA viruses and their biomarkers for clinical diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and further highlights promising technology for SARS-CoV-2 specific diagnosis. The comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers as well as their applicable biosensors in the field of clinical diagnosis were summarized to give scientists an advantage to develop superior diagnostic platforms. Furthermore, this review describes the prospects for this rapidly growing field of diagnostic research, raising further interest in analytical technology and strategic plan for future pandemics."
5438,Temporal trends of COVID-19 mortality and hospitalisation rates: an observational cohort study from the US Department of Veterans Affairs.,"Objectives: To investigate the temporal trends of 30-day mortality and hospitalisation in US Veterans with COVID-19 and 30-day mortality in hospitalised veterans with COVID-19 and to decompose the contribution of changes in the underlying characteristics of affected populations to these temporal changes. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: US Department of Veterans Affairs. Participants: 49 238 US veterans with a positive COVID-19 test between 20 March 2020 and 19 September 2020; and 9428 US veterans hospitalised with a positive COVID-19 test during the same period. Outcome measures: 30-day mortality rate and hospitalisation rate. Results: Between 20 March 2020 and 19 September 2020 and in COVID-19 positive individuals, 30-day mortality rate dropped by 9.2% from 13.6% to 4.4%; hospitalisation rate dropped by 16.8% from 33.8% to 17.0%. In hospitalised COVID-19 individuals, 30-day mortality rate dropped by 12.7% from 23.5% to 10.8%. Among COVID-19 positive individuals, decomposition analyses suggested that changes in demographic, health and contextual characteristics, COVID-19 testing capacity, and hospital occupancy rates accounted for 40.2% and 33.3% of the decline in 30-day mortality and hospitalisation, respectively. Changes in the underlying characteristics of hospitalised COVID-19 individuals accounted for 29.9% of the decline in 30-day mortality. Conclusion: Between March and September 2020, changes in demographic and health characteristics of people infected with COVID-19 contributed measurably to the substantial decline in 30-day mortality and hospitalisation."
5439,Renal transplantation after recovery from COVID-19 - a case report with implications for transplant programs in the face of the ongoing corona-pandemic.,"Background: The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has major impacts on both patients and healthcare systems worldwide, thus creating new realities. Patients on maintenance dialysis listed for renal transplantation are a vulnerable subgroup with many comorbidities and recurring contacts with the healthcare system. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic transplant numbers have dropped considerably, further increasing waiting times in this high-risk population. On the other hand, knowledge of the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised patients, development and persistence of neutralising antibodies in such patients is just emerging. It is unclear how best to address the dilemma of postponing the life-saving transplantation. Case presentation: We present a case report of a successful kidney transplantation only 65 days after the recipient was hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. In a follow up of 9 months, we observed no signs of recurrent disease and transplant function is excellent. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 antibody response demonstrates stable IgG levels. Conclusion: This reassuring case provides guidance to transplant centers how to proceed with kidney transplantation safely during the pandemic. Careful consideration of risks and benefits of the organ offer, full recovery from COVID-19 symptoms and the presence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test, qualifies for kidney transplantation."
