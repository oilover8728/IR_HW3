9500,COVID-19 Is Further Subdivided Into COVIP-19 and COVII-19.,
9501,"[New virus, new disease... and new challenges].","Since the emergence of the new coronavirus in China at the end of 2019 and its spread across five continents, our lives have changed. Confinement, state of health emergency, barrier gestures, physical distancing, etc., an arsenal of unprecedented measures has been put in place in France to break the chains of transmission of the virus and prevent the subsequent disease, COVID-19. A look back at these extraordinary events and what we know (or don't know) about the pandemic."
9502,Coronaviruses in Bats: A Review for the Americas.,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the focus of attention as it has caused more than three million human deaths globally. This and other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, have been suggested to be related to coronaviruses that are hosted in bats. This work shows, through a bibliographic review, the frequency of detection of coronavirus in bats species of the Americas. The presence of coronavirus in bats has been examined in 25 investigations in 11 countries of the Americas between 2007 and 2020. Coronaviruses have been explored in 9371 individuals from 160 species of bats, and 187 coronavirus sequences have been deposited in GenBank distributed in 43 species of bats. While 91% of the coronaviruses sequences identified infect a single species of bat, the remainder show a change of host, dominating the intragenera change. So far, only Mex-CoV-6 is related to MERS-CoV, a coronavirus pathogenic for humans, so further coronavirus research effort in yet unexplored bat species is warranted."
9503,Repurposing existing drugs: identification of SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease inhibitors.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its emergence, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only distressed medical services but also caused economic upheavals, marking urgent the need for effective therapeutics. The experience of combating SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has shown that inhibiting the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) blocks the replication of the virus. Given the well-studied properties of FDA-approved drugs, identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in an FDA-approved drug library would be of great therapeutic value. Here, we screened a library consisting of 774 FDA-approved drugs for potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, using an intramolecularly quenched fluorescence (IQF) peptide substrate. Ethacrynic acid, naproxen, allopurinol, butenafine hydrochloride, raloxifene hydrochloride, tranylcypromine hydrochloride, and saquinavir mesylate have been found to block the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The inhibitory activity of these repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro highlights their therapeutic potential for treating COVID-19 and other Betacoronavirus infections."
9504,"Autophagy, Unfolded Protein Response, and Neuropilin-1 Cross-Talk in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: What Can Be Learned from Other Coronaviruses.","The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 virus. This severe acute respiratory syndrome is currently a global health emergency and needs much effort to generate an urgent practical treatment to reduce COVID-19 complications and mortality in humans. Viral infection activates various cellular responses in infected cells, including cellular stress responses such as unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, following the inhibition of mTOR. Both UPR and autophagy mechanisms are involved in cellular and tissue homeostasis, apoptosis, innate immunity modulation, and clearance of pathogens such as viral particles. However, during an evolutionary arms race, viruses gain the ability to subvert autophagy and UPR for their benefit. SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells through binding to cell surface receptors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1). ACE2 blockage increases autophagy through mTOR inhibition, leading to gastrointestinal complications during SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. NRP1 is also regulated by the mTOR pathway. An increased NRP1 can enhance the susceptibility of immune system dendritic cells (DCs) to SARS-CoV-2 and induce cytokine storm, which is related to high COVID-19 mortality. Therefore, signaling pathways such as mTOR, UPR, and autophagy may be potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19. Hence, extensive investigations are required to confirm these potentials. Since there is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19 infection, we sought to review and discuss the important roles of autophagy, UPR, and mTOR mechanisms in the regulation of cellular responses to coronavirus infection to help identify new antiviral modalities against SARS-CoV-2 virus."
9505,Deactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with pulsed-xenon ultraviolet light: Implications for environmental COVID-19 control.,"Objectives: Prolonged survival of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on environmental surfaces and personal protective equipment may lead to these surfaces transmitting this pathogen to others. We sought to determine the effectiveness of a pulsed-xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) disinfection system in reducing the load of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. Methods: Chamber slides and N95 respirator material were directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and were exposed to different durations of PX-UV. Results: For hard surfaces, disinfection for 1, 2, and 5 minutes resulted in 3.53 log10, >4.54 log10, and >4.12 log10 reductions in viral load, respectively. For N95 respirators, disinfection for 5 minutes resulted in >4.79 log10 reduction in viral load. PX-UV significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. Conclusion: With the potential to rapidly disinfectant environmental surfaces and N95 respirators, PX-UV devices are a promising technology to reduce environmental and personal protective equipment bioburden and to enhance both healthcare worker and patient safety by reducing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2."
9506,Treatment and research lines for the patient with COVID-19. What do we have and where are we going?,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents the most significant global public health crisis of this generation. From the beginning of the pandemic, several publications and on-line resources about different treatment lines have been done, and development effort in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate potential therapies is unprecedented. Unfortunately, until now, there is not enough evidence to recommend any specific anti-COVID19 treatment. Randomized clinical trials and high-quality evidence, even in the middle of a pandemic, are needed. We provide a review of the latest published literature on the therapeutic strategies and current investigational lines for SARS-CoV-2."

9508,[Structure of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment of COVID-19].,"Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new type of coronavirus pneumonia, which is caused by infection of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The virus infects lung cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of cell surface, which leads to leukocyte infiltration, increased permeability of blood vessels and alveolar walls, and decreased surfactant in the lung, causing respiratory symptoms. The aggravation of local inflammation causes cytokine storm, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In December 2019, a number of new pneumonia cases were reported by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, after then a novel coronavirus was isolated and identified as SARS-CoV-2. To the date of Sep. 13th, 2020, COVID-19 is affecting 216 countries or regions, causing 28 637 952 cases, 917 417 deaths, and the mortality rate is 3.20%. This review will summarize the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the pharmaceutical treatment of COVID-19, and their potential relationships."
9509,"SARS-CoV-2 multifaceted interaction with human host. Part I: What we have learnt and done so far, and the still unknown realities.","SARS-CoV-2, the causing agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is a beta-coronavirus which has 80% genetic homology with SARS-CoV, but displays increased virulence and transmissibility. Initially, SARS-CoV-2 was considered a respiratory virus generally causing a mild disease, only severe and fatal in the elderly and individuals with underlying conditions. Severe illnesses and fatalities were attributed to a cytokine storm, an excessive response from the host immune system. However, with the number of infections over 10 millions and still soaring, the insidious and stealthy nature of the virus has emerged, as it causes a vast array of diverse unexpected symptoms among infected individuals, including the young and healthy. It has become evident that besides infecting the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can affect many organs, possibly through the infection of the endothelium. This review presents an overview of our learning curve with the novel virus emergence, transmission, pathology, biological properties and host-interactions. It also briefly describes remedial measures taken until an effective vaccine is available, that is non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the viral spread and the repurposing of existing drugs, approved or in development for other conditions to eliminate the virus or mitigate the cytokine storm."
