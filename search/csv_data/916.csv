9150,Thrombotic complications of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2: what pharmacovigilance reports tell us - and what they don't.,"Thrombotic complications of COVID-19 vaccination are very rare, but awareness is needed https://bit.ly/3n4vaXe"
9151,What do we know about the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in the environment?,"In view of the current situation regarding the Covid-19 disease, a discussion is proposed on the need for research focusing on the presence and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in water, soils and other environmental compartments, reached through wastewater and sewage sludge spreading. Also, the evaluation of current treatments for wastewater and sewage sludge, as well as the eventual development of new specific techniques, based on sorption, nanotechnology, etc., would be of great interest for controlling the environmental dissemination of these viruses in the current and eventual future outbreaks."
9152,Ophthalmic manifestations of COVID-19; a less-appreciated yet significant challenge.,"Aim: The current world has changed in all shapes since the emergence of the novel coronavirus (nCoV-2) also known as COVID-19. Among the extra-pulmonary manifestations of nCoV-2, ophthalmic symptoms have less been systematically studied. The so far existing body of evidence indicates that nCoV-2 has the potential to affect both anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. Albeit, the exact mechanisms which underlie ophthalmic manifestations of nCoV-2 are yet to be elucidated. Methods: The present brief review is an attempt to put together and highlight the significant yet limited number of studies which have spotlighted ophthalmic issues in nCoV-2 patients using a systematic literature search strategy. Results: All case series or reports (including both published and preprint articles) which described ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and/or documented testing of SARS-COV-2 in ocular secretions via various sampling or detection methods were sought to be included. Conclusion: The ophthalmic presentations in SARS-COV-2 are often found to be salient. Raising awareness in this respect may help defining evidencebased protective measures in today's practice of ophthalmology and allied disciplines."
9153,Nondetection of SARS-CoV-2 on high-touch surfaces of public areas next to COVID-19 hospitalization units.,"We studied the contamination with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the bacterial load of high-touch surfaces located in public areas next to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hospitalization units. Ninety-two samples were obtained from 46 different high-touch surfaces: 36 sites next to COVID-19 hospitalization units and 10 sites in the cabins of the public elevators. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected at any site, despite high bacterial loads suggested that the studied sites had been frequently touched prior to the sampling."
9154,Analysis of the potential impact of genomic variants in global SARS-CoV-2 genomes on molecular diagnostic assays.,"An epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus diseases (C0VID-19) initially reported in Wuhan, China has rapidly emerged into a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of the disease. Since the virus evolves by accumulating base substitutions, mutations in the viral genome could possibly affect the accuracy of RT-PCR-based detection assays. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites of the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primer or probe sequences from literature and data available in the public domain. Our analysis revealed that a total of 5862 unique genetic variants mapped to at least one of the 132 primer or probe binding sites in the genome. A total of 29 unique variants were present in ≥ 1% of genomes from at least one of the continents (Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America) that mapped to 36 unique primers or probes binding sites. Similarly, a total of 27 primer or probe binding sites had cumulative variants frequency of ≥ 1% in the global SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are used worldwide for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. We also found 286 SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions with low variability at a continuous stretch of ≥ 20bps that could be potentially used for primer designing. This highlights the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to enable evidence-based policies for development and approval of diagnostics."
9155,"Symptom Diary-Based Analysis of Disease Course among Patients with Mild Coronavirus Disease, Germany, 2020.","Limited information is available on the clinical course of outpatients with mild coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This information is critically important to inform public health prevention strategies and to provide anticipatory guidance to patients, primary care providers, and employers. We retrospectively assessed the daily prevalence of symptoms in 313 COVID-19 outpatients for the first 20 days of illness. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the probability of symptom occurrence over time. Fatigue (91%), cough (85%), and headache (78%) were the most common symptoms and occurred a median of 1 day from symptom onset. Neurologic symptoms, such as loss of taste (66%) and anosmia (62%), and dyspnea (51%) occurred considerably later (median 3-4 days after symptom onset). Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of other respiratory pathogens, so symptomatic patients should be tested more frequently for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during influenza season to prevent further spread of COVID-19."
9156,Human pluripotent stem cell-based organoids and cell platforms for modelling SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug discovery.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected over 200 countries and territories worldwide and resulted in more than 2.5 million deaths. In a pressing search for treatments and vaccines, research models based on human stem cells are emerging as crucial tools to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and cellular responses across different tissues. Here, we provide an overview of the variety of human pluripotent stem cell-based platforms adopted in SARS-CoV-2 research, comprising monolayer cultures and organoids, which model the multitude of affected tissues in vitro. We highlight the strengths of these platforms, including their application to assess both the susceptible cell types and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. We describe their use to identify drug candidates for further investigation in addition to discussing their limitations in fully recapitulating COVID-19 pathophysiology. Overall, stem cell models are facilitating the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and prove to be versatile platforms for studying infections."
9157,A Biochemical Perspective of the Nonstructural Proteins (NSPs) and the Spike Protein of SARS CoV-2.,"The global pandemic that shut down the world in 2020 was caused by the virus, SARS CoV-2. The chemistry of the various nonstructural proteins (NSP3, NSP5, NSP12, NSP13, NSP14, NSP15, NSP16) of SARS CoV-2 is discussed. Secondly, a recent major focus of this pandemic is the variant strains of SARS CoV-2 that are increasingly occurring and more transmissible. One strain, called ""D614G"", possesses a glycine (G) instead of an aspartate (D) at position 614 of the spike protein. Additionally, other emerging strains called ""501Y.V1"" and ""501Y.V2"" have several differences in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein (N501Y) as well as other locations. These structural changes may enhance the interaction between the spike protein and the ACE2 receptor of the host, increasing infectivity. The global pandemic caused by SARS CoV-2 is a rapidly evolving situation, emphasizing the importance of continuing the efforts to interrogate and understand this virus."

9159,COVID-19 and the liver: A 2021 update.,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, China and has since resulted in a global pandemic in excess of 165 million reported infections and 3.4 million attributable deaths. COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, which may be complicated by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is also responsible for numerous extrapulmonary manifestations involving the haematologic, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary, endocrinologic, neurologic, ophthalmologic and dermatologic systems. This review will discuss the pathophysiology of COVID-19; focusing on the mechanisms and outcomes of liver injury associated with COVID-19; its impact on chronic liver disease (CLD); management of CLD during the COVID-19 pandemic and the long-term impact of COVID-19 on CLD."
