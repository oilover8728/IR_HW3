9810,"Screening, simulation, and optimization design of small molecule inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern. The spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target of antiviral drugs. Focusing on the existing S protein structure, molecular docking was used in this study to calculate the binding energy and interaction sites between 14 antiviral molecules with different structures and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and the potential drug candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were analyzed. Tizoxanide, dolutegravir, bictegravir, and arbidol were found to have high binding energies, and they effectively bind key sites of the S1 and S2 subunits, inhibiting the virus by causing conformational changes in S1 and S2 during the fusion of the S protein with host cells. Based on the interactions among the drug molecules, the S protein and the amino acid environment around the binding sites, rational structure-based optimization was performed using the molecular connection method and bioisosterism strategy to obtain Ti-2, BD-2, and Ar-3, which have much stronger binding ability to the S protein than the original molecules. This study provides valuable clues for identifying S protein inhibitor binding sites and the mechanism of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect as well as useful inspiration and help for the discovery and optimization of small molecule S protein inhibitors."

We discuss here how the approved vaccines trigger innate immunity to promote durable immunological memory and consider the future implications of protecting populations with these vaccines."
9813,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations that attenuate monoclonal and serum antibody neutralization.,"Neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein are a goal of COVID-19 vaccines and have received emergency use authorization as therapeutics. However, viral escape mutants could compromise efficacy. To define immune-selected mutations in the S protein, we exposed a VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric virus, in which the VSV glycoprotein is replaced with the S protein, to 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and generated 50 different escape mutants. Each mAb had a unique resistance profile, although many shared residues within an epitope of the RBD. Some variants (e.g., S477N) were resistant to neutralization by multiple mAbs, whereas others (e.g., E484K) escaped neutralization by convalescent sera. Additionally, sequential selection identified mutants that escape neutralization by antibody cocktails. Comparing these antibody-mediated mutations with sequence variation in circulating SARS-CoV-2 revealed substitutions that may attenuate neutralizing immune responses in some humans and thus warrant further investigation."
9814,"Post lockdown COVID-19 seroprevalence and circulation at the time of delivery, France.","Background: To fight the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown has been decreed in many countries worldwide. The impact of pregnancy as a severity risk factor is still debated, but strict lockdown measures have been recommended for pregnant women. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the seroprevalence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a maternity ward in an area that has been significantly affected by the virus. Study design: Prospective study at the Antoine Béclère Hospital maternity ward (Paris area, France) from May 4 (one week before the end of lockdown) to May 31, 2020 (three weeks after the end of lockdown). All patients admitted to the delivery room during this period were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serology test as well concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on one nasopharyngeal sample. Results: A total of 249 women were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8%. The RT-PCR positive rate was 0.5%. 47.4% of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive pregnant women never experienced any symptoms. A history of symptoms during the epidemic, such as fever (15.8%), myalgia (36.8%) and anosmia (31.6%), was suggestive of previous infection. Conclusions: Three weeks after the end of French lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were scarce in our region. A very high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative pregnant women, which is comparable to that of the general population, must be taken into consideration in the event of a resurgence of the pandemic. The traces of a past active circulation of the virus in this fragile population during the spring wave should encourage public health authorities to take specific measures for this independent at-risk group, in order to reduce viral circulation in pregnant patients."
9815,COVID-19 and ophthalmology: A scientometric analysis.,"Purpose: Coronavirus disease pandemic has impacted global healthcare tremendously and ophthalmology is one of the high-hit specialties. An increasing number of research items are upcoming with COVID-19-related research in ophthalmology and this report aims at performing a scientometric analysis of all the available research pertaining to COVID-19 and ophthalmology. Methods: A Web of Science (https://webofknowledge.com) query TS = (""novel coronavirus 2019"" OR ""coronavirus 2019"" OR ""COVID 2019"" OR ""COVID 19"" OR ""nCOV"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""COVID-19"") AND WC = (""Ophthalmology"") was deployed on February 22, 2021, to retrieve all research items on the topics of interest. R software (v4.0.1) with Bibliometrix library was deployed to visualize metrics to quantify geographical distribution, source metrics, author metrics, document metrics, and keyword metrics. Results: A total of 616 research items appeared in our search results that were drafted by 2398 authors and published in 63 sources. India, USA, UK, and China had the greatest number of research items among others. Indian Journal of Ophthalmology, Eye, and Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology were sources with greatest number of research items. Documents per author were 0.257 and authors per document were 3.89. The collaboration index was noted to be 4.28. Conclusion: Our scientometric analysis presents descriptive quantitative metrics for COVID-related research in the field of ophthalmology and provides evidence for the increased global collaboration that global researchers have fostered to fight this pandemic."
9816,Detection of Binding Sites on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor-Binding Domain by Molecular Dynamics Simulations in Mixed Solvents.,"The novel SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) receptor as an entry point. Insights on S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction with ACE2 receptor and drug repurposing has accelerated drug discovery for the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finding small molecule binding sites in S protein and ACE2 interface is crucial in search of effective drugs to prevent viral entry. In this study, we employed molecular dynamics simulations in mixed solvents together with virtual screening to identify small molecules that could be potential inhibitors of S protein -ACE2 interaction. Observation of organic probe molecule localization during the simulations revealed multiple sites at the S protein surface related to small molecule, antibody, and ACE2 binding. In addition, a novel conformation of the S protein was discovered that could be stabilized by small molecules to inhibit attachment to ACE2. The most promising binding site on RBD-ACE2 interface was targeted with virtual screening and top-ranked compounds (DB08248, DB02651, DB03714, and DB14826) are suggested for experimental testing. The protocol described here offers an extremely fast method for characterizing key proteins of a novel pathogen and for the identification of compounds that could inhibit or accelerate spreading of the disease."

9818,Rapid Screening Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assays Using Z-Scores to Standardize Results.,Many serologic tests are now available for measuring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies to evaluate potential protective immunity and for seroprevalence studies.

9819,Household Cases Suggest That Cats Belonging to Owners with COVID-19 Have a Limited Role in Virus Transmission.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for COVID-19 and spread rapidly following its emergence in Wuhan in 2019. Although cats are, among other domestic animals, susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, little is known about their epidemiological role in the dynamics of a household infection. In this study, we monitored five cats for viral shedding daily. Each cat was confined with its COVID-19 positive owners in separate households. Low loads of viral nucleic acid were found in two cats, but only one developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which suggests that cats have a limited role in COVID-19 epidemiology."
