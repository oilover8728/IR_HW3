2332,Antibody-guided structure-based vaccines.,"The vaccine field is pursuing diverse approaches to translate the molecular insights from analyses of effective antibodies and their targeted epitopes into immunogens capable of eliciting protective immune responses. Here we review current antibody-guided strategies including conformation-based, epitope-based, and lineage-based vaccine approaches, which are yielding promising vaccine candidates now being evaluated in clinical trials. We summarize directions being employed by the field, including the use of sequencing technologies to monitor and track developing immune responses for understanding and improving antibody-based immunity. We review opportunities and challenges to transform powerful new discoveries into safe and effective vaccines, which are encapsulated by vaccine efforts against a variety of pathogens including HIV-1, influenza A virus, malaria parasites, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this review summarizes the extensive progress that has been made to realize antibody-guided structure-based vaccines, the considerable challenges faced, and the opportunities afforded by recently developed molecular approaches to vaccine development."
2333,Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines: From clinical trials to real life.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the globe leading to the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate the effects of the virus on public health and the global economy, vaccines were rapidly developed. In less than one year, with respect to usual clinical development rules, several vaccines have been put on the market and mass vaccination campaigns have been deployed. During the phase I to phase III clinical trials, most of these vaccines have demonstrated both their safety and efficacy. Despite questions remain about the impact of virus variants and the duration of the immune response, messenger RNA (mRNA)-based and adenoviral vectored vaccines have demonstrated an overall efficacy from 70 to 95% in both phase III trials and real life. In addition, all these vaccines also reduce the severe forms of the disease and might strongly impact the mortality which could change the course of the pandemic."
2334,Pulmonary Ultrasound in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Systematic Review.,"The goal of this review was to systematize the evidence on pulmonary ultrasound (PU) use in diagnosis, monitorization or hospital discharge criteria for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evidence on the use of PU for diagnosis and monitorization of or as hospital discharge criteria for COVID-19 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between December 1, 2019 and July 5, 2020 was compared with evidence obtained with thoracic radiography (TR), chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR. The type of study, motives for use of PU, population, type of transducer and protocol, results of PU and quantitative or qualitative correlation with TR and/or chest CT and/or RT-PCR were evaluated. A total of 28 articles comprising 418 patients were involved. The average age was 50 y (standard deviation: 25.1 y), and there were 395 adults and 23 children. One hundred forty-three were women, 13 of whom were pregnant. The most frequent result was diffuse, coalescent and confluent B-lines. The plural line was irregular, interrupted or thickened. The presence of subpleural consolidation was noduliform, lobar or multilobar. There was good qualitative correlation between TR and chest CT and a quantitative correlation with chest CT of r = 0.65 (p < 0.001). Forty-four patients were evaluated only with PU. PU is a useful tool for diagnosis and monitorization and as criteria for hospital discharge for patients with COVID-19."
2335,COVID-19 and hepatitis B infection.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a major burden worldwide, resulting in serious public health challenges. HBV infection is another widely spread virus that chronically affects about 257 million people. The management of patients with HBV infection has gained attention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 have varying levels of liver involvements, resulting from direct viral effects on the liver as well as hepatotoxic drugs. This was demonstrated by elevated levels of liver enzymes, particularly evident in those patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, scarce information is available on the management of COVID-19 patients having an underlying chronic liver disease, including HBV infection. Studies have shown reactivation of HBV infection following treatment with tocilizumab and corticosteroids, emphasizing the need for caution when using these agents to treat COVID-19 patients with HBV infection. HBV screening and prophylaxis should be considered in patients with elevated transaminase levels and also in high prevalence populations. In patients with advanced liver disease, attention must be given to minimize the risk of liver decompensation. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to enable an evidence-based approach for the care of these patients."
2336,"Immunogenicity and safety of a recombinant fusion protein vaccine (V-01) against coronavirus disease 2019 in healthy adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial.","Background: Innovative coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, with elevated global manufacturing capacity, enhanced safety and efficacy, simplified dosing regimens, and distribution that is less cold chain-dependent, are still global imperatives for tackling the ongoing pandemic. A previous phase I trial indicated that the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (V-01), which contains a fusion protein (IFN-PADRE-RBD-Fc dimer) as its antigen, is safe and well tolerated, capable of inducing rapid and robust immune responses, and warranted further testing in additional clinical trials. Herein, we aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of V-01, providing rationales of appropriate dose regimen for further efficacy study. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial was initiated at the Gaozhou Municipal Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangdong, China) in March 2021. Both younger (n = 440; 18-59 years of age) and older (n = 440; ≥60 years of age) adult participants in this trial were sequentially recruited into two distinct groups: two-dose regimen group in which participants were randomized either to follow a 10 or 25 μg of V-01 or placebo given intramuscularly 21 days apart (allocation ratio, 3:3:1, n = 120, 120, 40 for each regimen, respectively), or one-dose regimen groups in which participants were randomized either to receive a single injection of 50 μg of V-01 or placebo (allocation ratio, 3:1, n = 120, 40, respectively). The primary immunogenicity endpoints were the geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies against live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and specific binding antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The primary safety endpoint evaluation was the frequencies and percentages of overall adverse events (AEs) within 30 days after full immunization. Results: V-01 provoked substantial immune responses in the two-dose group, achieving encouragingly high titers of neutralizing antibody and anti-RBD immunoglobulin, which peaked at day 35 (161.9 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 133.3-196.7] and 149.3 [95%CI: 123.9-179.9] in 10 and 25 μg V-01 group of younger adults, respectively; 111.6 [95%CI: 89.6-139.1] and 111.1 [95%CI: 89.2-138.4] in 10 and 25 μg V-01 group of older adults, respectively), and remained high at day 49 after a day-21 second dose; these levels significantly exceed those in convalescent serum from symptomatic COVID-19 patients (53.6, 95%CI: 31.3-91.7). Our preliminary data show that V-01 is safe and well tolerated, with reactogenicity predominantly being absent or mild in severity and only one vaccine-related grade 3 or worse AE being observed within 30 days. The older adult participants demonstrated a more favorable safety profile compared with those in the younger adult group: with AEs percentages of 19.2%, 25.8%, 17.5% in older adults vs. 34.2%, 23.3%, 26.7% in younger adults at the 10, 25 μg V-01 two-dose group, and 50 μg V-01 one-dose group, respectively. Conclusions: The vaccine candidate V-01 appears to be safe and immunogenic. The preliminary findings support the advancement of the two-dose, 10 μg V-01 regimen to a phase III trial for a large-scale population-based evaluation of safety and efficacy.

2337,Rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and vaccination impact the fate of vaccine-resistant strains.,"Vaccines are thought to be the best available solution for controlling the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the emergence of vaccine-resistant strains may come too rapidly for current vaccine developments to alleviate the health, economic and social consequences of the pandemic. To quantify and characterize the risk of such a scenario, we created a SIR-derived model with initial stochastic dynamics of the vaccine-resistant strain to study the probability of its emergence and establishment. Using parameters realistically resembling SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we model a wave-like pattern of the pandemic and consider the impact of the rate of vaccination and the strength of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures on the probability of emergence of a resistant strain. As expected, we found that a fast rate of vaccination decreases the probability of emergence of a resistant strain. Counterintuitively, when a relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions happened at a time when most individuals of the population have already been vaccinated the probability of emergence of a resistant strain was greatly increased. Consequently, we show that a period of transmission reduction close to the end of the vaccination campaign can substantially reduce the probability of resistant strain establishment. Our results suggest that policymakers and individuals should consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions and transmission-reducing behaviours throughout the entire vaccination period."

2339,The impact of immuno-aging on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has almost 56 million confirmed cases resulting in over 1.3 million deaths as of November 2020. This infection has proved more deadly to older adults (those >65 years of age) and those with immunocompromising conditions. The worldwide population aged 65 years and older is increasing, and the total number of aged individuals will outnumber those younger than 65 years by the year 2050. Aging is associated with a decline in immune function and chronic activation of inflammation that contributes to enhanced viral susceptibility and reduced responses to vaccination. Here we briefly review the pathogenicity of the virus, epidemiology and clinical response, and the underlying mechanisms of human aging in improving vaccination. We review current methods to improve vaccination in the older adults using novel vaccine platforms and adjuvant systems. We conclude by summarizing the existing clinical trials for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and discussing how to address the unique challenges for vaccine development presented with an aging immune system."
