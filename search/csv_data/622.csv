6210,Low In-School COVID-19 Transmission and Asymptomatic Infection Despite High Community Prevalence.,"There is concern that in-person schooling during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will facilitate disease transmission. Through asymptomatic surveillance and contact tracing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we found low rates of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and little in-school transmission of COVID-19 when physical distancing and masking strategies were enforced despite a high community prevalence of COVID-19."
6211,When politics collides with public health: COVID-19 vaccine country of origin and vaccination acceptance in Brazil.,"This study examines the effect of the country of origin of the vaccine on vaccination acceptance against COVID-19. More specifically, we show how the political context in Brazil has affected acceptance of vaccines produced in China, Russia, the US, and England at the University of Oxford. Our data come from a survey experiment applied to a national sample of 2771 adult Brazilians between September 23 and October 2, 2020. We find greater rejection among Brazilians for vaccines developed in China and Russia, as compared to vaccines from the US or England. We also find that rejection of the Chinese-developed vaccine is particularly strong among those who support President Jair Bolsonaro-a COVID-19 denier and strong critic of China and vaccination, in general."
6212,Latent periodicity-2 in coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome: Evolutionary implications.,"The ongoing global pandemic of infection disease COVID-19 caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2, formerly 2019-nCoV) presents critical threats to public health and the economy. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 had been sequenced and structurally annotated, yet little is known of the intrinsic organization and evolution of the genome. To this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of barcode, of SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses. The genomic spectrum is constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides and therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits predominant latent periodicity-2 regions of non-structural proteins 3, 4, 5, and 6. Further analysis of the latent periodicity-2 regions suggests that the dinucleotide imbalances are increased during evolution and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus. Especially, SARS-CoV-2 isolates have increased latent periodicity-2 and periodicity-3 during COVID-19 pandemic. The special strong periodicity-2 regions and the intensity of periodicity-2 in the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome may become diagnostic and pharmaceutical targets in monitoring and curing the COVID-19 disease."

6214,How SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spreads within infected hosts - what we know so far.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), belongs to the betacoronavirus genus and shares high homology to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that emerged in 2003. These are highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses which very likely originated in bats. SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV, and spreads primarily through the respiratory tract. Although several trials for vaccine development are currently underway, investigations into the virology of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the fundamental biology of the infectious cycle and the associated immunopathology underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are crucial for identification and rational design of effective therapies. This review provides an overview of how SARS-CoV-2 infects and spreads within human hosts with specific emphasis on key aspects of its lifecycle, tropism and immunopathological features."
6215,International travel during the COVID-19 pandemic: implications and risks associated with 'travel bubbles'.,"Air travel is considered as the major route that facilitated the distribution of COVID-19 across international borders. Passengers with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection can bypass the symptom-based surveillance systems established in the airports. Travel bubbles should be considered as an effective compromise in preventive strategies. Therefore, strict preventive measures have to be implemented at the entry and exit points in addition to the measures taken for preventing on-board transmission SARS-CoV-2."
6216,Age-Specific Differences in the Severity of COVID-19 Between Children and Adults: Reality and Reasons.,"In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, children experience mild symptoms compared to adults. However, the precise explanations for this disparity are not clear. Thus, we attempted to identify rational explanations about age-related differences as reported in different studies. Given the incomplete data on SARS-CoV-2, some information has been gathered from other studies of earlier coronavirus or influenza outbreaks. Age-related differences in disease severity are important with regard to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In addition, these differences impact social distancing needs, since pediatric patients with mild or asymptomatic are likely to play a significant role in disease transmission."
6217,Tracking the dynamics and allocating tests for COVID-19 in real-time: An acceleration index with an application to French age groups and departements.,"An acceleration index is proposed as a novel indicator to track the dynamics of COVID-19 in real-time. Using data on cases and tests in France for the period between the first and second lock-downs-May 13 to October 25, 2020-our acceleration index shows that the pandemic resurgence can be dated to begin around July 7. It uncovers that the pandemic acceleration was stronger than national average for the [59-68] and especially the 69 and older age groups since early September, the latter being associated with the strongest acceleration index, as of October 25. In contrast, acceleration among the [19-28] age group was the lowest and is about half that of the [69-78]. In addition, we propose an algorithm to allocate tests among French ""départements"" (roughly counties), based on both the acceleration index and the feedback effect of testing. Our acceleration-based allocation differs from the actual distribution over French territories, which is population-based. We argue that both our acceleration index and our allocation algorithm are useful tools to guide public health policies as France might possibly enter a third lock-down period with indeterminate duration."
6218,"Community-Associated Outbreak of COVID-19 in a Correctional Facility - Utah, September 2020-January 2021.","Transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is common in congregate settings such as correctional and detention facilities (1-3). On September 17, 2020, a Utah correctional facility (facility A) received a report of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dental health care provider (DHCP) who had treated incarcerated persons at facility A on September 14, 2020 while asymptomatic. On September 21, 2020, the roommate of an incarcerated person who had received dental treatment experienced COVID-19-compatible symptoms*; both were housed in block 1 of facility A (one of 16 occupied blocks across eight residential units). Two days later, the roommate received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, becoming the first person with a known-associated case of COVID-19 at facility A. During September 23-24, 2020, screening of 10 incarcerated persons who had received treatment from the DHCP identified another two persons with COVID-19, prompting isolation of all three patients in an unoccupied block at the facility. Within block 1, group activities were stopped to limit interaction among staff members and incarcerated persons and prevent further spread. During September 14-24, 2020, six facility A staff members, one of whom had previous close contact† with one of the patients, also reported symptoms. On September 27, 2020, an outbreak was confirmed after specimens from all remaining incarcerated persons in block 1 were tested; an additional 46 cases of COVID-19 were identified, which were reported to the Salt Lake County Health Department and the Utah Department of Health. On September 30, 2020, CDC, in collaboration with both health departments and the correctional facility, initiated an investigation to identify factors associated with the outbreak and implement control measures. As of January 31, 2021, a total of 1,368 cases among 2,632 incarcerated persons (attack rate = 52%) and 88 cases among 550 staff members (attack rate = 16%) were reported in facility A. Among 33 hospitalized incarcerated persons, 11 died. Quarantine and monitoring of potentially exposed persons and implementation of available prevention measures, including vaccination, are important in preventing introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in correctional facilities and other congregate settings (4)."
