561,Long-term clinical and serological follow-up of paediatric patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.,"Studies concerning Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in paediatrics are limited to children mainly selected from hospitals, where patients with complications and co-morbidities are managed. We aimed to describe the course of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a population of children enrolled by place of residence, from diagnosis to recovery, with a long-term clinical and serological follow-up. We identified patients aged <14 years old living in the Turin Health District 3 who had SARS-CoV-2 detected in at least one nasopharyngeal swab from 1st March to 1st June 2020. Epidemiological and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected by way of a telephone inquiry. Enrolled patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology in order to provide evidence of seroconversion and persistence of specific antibodies some time after the infection. A total of 46 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 were identified. The main pattern of viral transmission was intra-family. Eleven children were totally asymptomatic. If symptoms appeared, the disease had a mild course. A single case of COVID-19-related respiratory insufficiency was registered. Among children who underwent serological evaluation, 84% had seroconversion. No significant differences in antibody development were found according to the age and the burden of the disease. Children tested farther from the primary infection had lower antibody index titre values than the others. In conclusion, COVID-19 has a good prognosis in paediatric age. Children are able to develop a valid immune response, although their index titres seem to decrease a long time after the disease."
562,"Clinical performance of Roche cobas 6800, Luminex ARIES, MiRXES Fortitude Kit 2.1, Altona RealStar, and Applied Biosystems TaqPath for SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs.","We compared the performance of five assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection on nasopharyngeal swab samples: Roche ""cobas,"" Luminex ""ARIES,"" MiRXES ""Fortitude,"" Altona ""RealStar,"" and Thermo Fisher Scientific ""TaqPath."" A total of 94 nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from 80 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 cases in the first 2 weeks of illness (median, 7 days; range, 2-14 days) and 14 healthy controls. After collection, all samples were transported to the hospital clinical laboratory within 24 h. These samples were tested on all five assays within 3 days of sample receipt. Of the 94 samples, 69 yielded the same result on all platforms, resulting in an agreement of 73.4% (69 of 94). Of these, 14 were the healthy control swabs which all tested negative, demonstrating good specificity across all platforms. The ARIES assay had the lowest detection rate (68.8%), followed by Fortitude (85.0%), RealStar (86.3%), cobas (95.0%), and TaqPath (100%). Statistically significant differences were observed for ARIES, Fortitude, and RealStar when compared against the best performing TaqPath using McNemar's Ï‡2 test. A consensus result was established based on the results obtained by the cobas, Fortitude, RealStar, and TaqPath. Six discrepancies had failed to reach a consensus and were adjudicated using the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the TaqPath and cobas assays were the most sensitive at detecting their designated SARS-CoV-2 gene targets. On the other hand, the ARIES assay was the least sensitive, thus warranting the need for assay re-optimization before go-live at the testing laboratory."
563,Clinical Evaluation of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test and a Diagnostic Platform Switch during 48 Hours in the Midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Laboratories are currently witnessing extraordinary demand globally for sampling devices, reagents, consumables, and diagnostic instruments needed for timely diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To meet diagnostic needs as the pandemic grows, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted several commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), but manufacturer-independent evaluation data are scarce. We performed the first manufacturer-independent evaluation of the fully automated sample-to-result two-target test cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 (cobas) (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ), which received U.S. FDA EUA on 12 March 2020. The comparator was a standardized 3-h SARS-CoV-2 protocol, consisting of RNA extraction using an automated portable instrument, followed by a two-target reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-PCR), which our laboratory has routinely used since January 2020 [V. M. Corman, O. Landt, M. Kaiser, R. Molenkamp, et al., Euro Surveill 25(3):pii=2000045, 2020, https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045]. cobas and the comparator showed overall agreement of 98.1% and a kappa value of 0.95 on an in-house validation panel consisting of 217 well-characterized retrospective samples. Immediate prospective head-to-head comparative evaluation followed on 502 samples, and the diagnostic approaches showed overall agreement of 99.6% and a kappa value of 0.98. A good correlation (r 2 = 0.96) between cycle threshold values for SARS-CoV-2-specific targets obtained by cobas and the comparator was observed. Our results showed that cobas is a reliable assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in the Universal Transport Medium System (UTM-RT) (Copan, Brescia, Italy). Under the extraordinary circumstances that laboratories are facing worldwide, a safe diagnostic platform switch is feasible in only 48 h and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic if carefully planned and executed."

565,Pool testing on random and natural clusters of individuals: Optimisation of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in the presence of low viral load samples.,"Facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic requires intensive testing on the population to early identify and isolate infected subjects. During the first emergency phase of the epidemic, RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, which is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, exhibited limitations due to availability of reagents and budget constraints. This stressed the need to develop screening procedures that require fewer resources and are suitable to be extended to larger portions of the population. RT-qPCR on pooled samples from individual NP swabs seems to be a promising technique to improve surveillance. We performed preliminary experimental analyses aimed to investigate the performance of pool testing on samples with low viral load and we evaluated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations alternative screening protocols based on sample pooling, tailored to contexts characterized by different infection prevalence. We focused on the role of pool size and the opportunity to develop strategies that take advantage of natural clustering structures in the population, e.g. families, school classes, hospital rooms. Despite the use of a limited number of specimens, our results suggest that, while high viral load samples seem to be detectable even in a pool with 29 negative samples, positive specimens with low viral load may be masked by the negative samples, unless smaller pools are used. The results of MC simulations confirm that pool testing is useful in contexts where the infection prevalence is low. The gain of pool testing in saving resources can be very high, and can be optimized by selecting appropriate group sizes. Exploiting natural groups makes the definition of larger pools convenient and potentially overcomes the issue of low viral load samples by increasing the probability of identifying more than one positive in the same pool."
566,Sensitivity of ID NOW and RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in an ambulatory population.,"Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) requires confirmation by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Abbott ID NOW provides fast results but has been criticized for low sensitivity. Here we determine the sensitivity of ID NOW in an ambulatory population presented for testing. The study enrolled 785 symptomatic patients, of whom 21 were positive by both ID NOW and RT-PCR, and 2 only by RT-PCR. All 189 asymptomatic patients tested negative. The positive percent agreement between the ID NOW assay and the RT-PCR assay was 91.3%, and negative percent agreement was 100%. The results from the current study were included into a larger systematic review of literature where at least 20 subjects were simultaneously tested using ID NOW and RT-PCR. The overall sensitivity for ID NOW assay was calculated at 84% (95% confidence interval 55-96%) and had the highest correlation to RT-PCR at viral loads most likely to be associated with transmissible infections."
567,Simpler and faster Covid-19 testing: Strategies to streamline SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays.,"Background: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections is important for treatment, isolation of infected and exposed individuals, and contact tracing. RT-qPCR is the ""gold-standard"" method to sensitively detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but most laboratory-developed RT-qPCR assays involve complex steps. Here, we aimed to simplify RT-qPCR assays by streamlining reaction setup, eliminating RNA extraction, and proposing reduced-cost detection workflows that avoid the need for expensive qPCR instruments. Method: A low-cost RT-PCR based ""kit"" was developed for faster turnaround than the CDC developed protocol. We demonstrated three detection workflows: two that can be deployed in laboratories conducting assays of variable complexity, and one that could be simple enough for point-of-care. Analytical sensitivity was assessed using SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked in simulated nasal matrix. Clinical performance was evaluated using contrived human nasal matrix (n = 41) and clinical nasal specimens collected from individuals with respiratory symptoms (n = 110). Finding: The analytical sensitivity of the lyophilised RT-PCR was 10 copies/reaction using purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 20 copies/reaction when using direct lysate in simulated nasal matrix. Evaluation of assay performance on contrived human matrix showed 96.7-100% specificity and 100% sensitivity at â‰¥20 RNA copies. A head-to-head comparison with the standard CDC protocol on clinical specimens showed 83.8-94.6% sensitivity and 96.8-100% specificity. We found 3.6% indeterminate samples (undetected human control), lower than 8.1% with the standard protocol. Interpretation: This preliminary work should support laboratories or commercial entities to develop and expand access to Covid-19 testing. Software guidance development for this assay is ongoing to enable implementation in other settings. FUND: USA NIH R01AI140845 and Seattle Children's Research Institute."
568,Clinical evaluation of the antibody response in patients with COVID-19 using automated high-throughput immunoassays.,"Several automated high-throughput immunoassays for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by a semi-quantitative approach have been commercialized. In this study, we describe the timeline of the antibody response in patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. A total of 292 sequential serum samples from 33 Japanese patients were retrospectively analyzed using four test kits for SARS-CoV-2: the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott), ElecsysÂ® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Diagnostic), and VITROSÂ® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and IgG assays (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics). All automated immunoassays could equivalently identify positive sera collected within 2 weeks after symptom onset (99.3%-100%). In addition, the S protein-based automated immunoassay, the VITROSÂ® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total assay, may play a complementary role in evaluating passive antibody therapies or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, although further research is required."
569,"Understanding varying COVID-19 mortality rates reported in Africa compared to Europe, Americas and Asia.","The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has impacted every nation on the globe, albeit disproportionately. African countries have seen lower infection and mortality rates than most countries in the Americas Europe and Asia. In this commentary, we explore some of the factors purported to be responsible for the low COVID-19 infection and case fatality rates in Africa: low testing rate, poor documentation of cause of death, younger age population, good vitamin D status as a result of exposure to sunlight, cross-immunity from other viruses including coronaviruses, and lessons learnt from other infectious diseases such as HIV and Ebola. With the advent of a new variant of COVID-19 and inadequate roll-out of vaccines, an innovative and efficient response is needed to ramp up testing, contact tracing and accurate reporting of infection rates and cause of death in order to mitigate the spread of the infection."
