6820,A single-dose mRNA vaccine provides a long-term protection for hACE2 transgenic mice from SARS-CoV-2.,"The rapid expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine a global health and economic priority. Taking advantage of versatility and rapid development, three SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials with a two-dose immunization regimen. However, the waning antibody response in convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection and the emergence of human re-infection have raised widespread concerns about a possible short duration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection. Here, we developed a nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine in lipid-encapsulated form that encoded the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, termed as mRNA-RBD. A single immunization of mRNA-RBD elicited both robust neutralizing antibody and cellular responses, and conferred a near-complete protection against wild SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of hACE2 transgenic mice. Noticeably, the high levels of neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice induced by mRNA-RBD vaccination were maintained for at least 6.5 months and conferred a long-term notable protection for hACE2 transgenic mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a sera transfer study. These data demonstrated that a single dose of mRNA-RBD provided long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge."
6821,dsmCRISPR: Dual synthetic mismatches CRISPR/Cas12a-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation.,"Fast evolving of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has caused the spreading of COVID-19 disease rapidly around the globe. The mutation, especially in the gene encoding spike protein has helped the virus adapt and evade human immune system, as well as affect the efficacy of the immunizations and treatments. SARS-CoV-2 variant carrying D614G amino acid change at the spike protein is the most dominant strain in the pandemic. Therefore, efficient detection of the SARS-CoV-2 variants including D614G mutation is critical to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we report a dual synthetic mismatches CRISPR/Cas12a (dsmCRISPR) method to detect the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation with high sensitivity and specificity. By targeting SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation, synthetic mismatch crRNAs were designed from -3 to +3 position around the mutation site. To improve the sensitivity and specificity, a synthetic mismatch primer with a 3'-terminal base complementary to the D614G point mutation and a mismatch next to 3'-terminal base was used to specifically amplify the D614G mutation site with higher annealing temperature. Using synthetic mismatch crRNA-(-1), a higher ratio (13.45) of the fluorescence between G614 and D614 was observed. When combined with mismatch primer to amplify D614G mutation, the fluorescence ratio of G614/D164 template detected was increased by 73.53% to 23.12. This method can detect the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation nucleic acid with high sensitivity, which was validated with synthetic SARS-CoV-2 D614G RNA. Therefore, the dsmCRIPSR method has significant potential to serve as a sensitive and specific assay for SARS-CoV-2 D614G detection and could be further extended for the detection of other SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest."
6822,"COVID-19 in Health-Care Workers: A Living Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Prevalence, Risk Factors, Clinical Characteristics, and Outcomes.","Health-care workers (HCWs) are at the frontline of response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), being at a higher risk of acquiring the disease and, subsequently, exposing patients and others. Searches of 8 bibliographic databases were performed to systematically review the evidence on the prevalence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among HCWs. A total of 97 studies (all published in 2020) met the inclusion criteria. The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from HCWs' samples, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the presence of antibodies, was 11% (95% confidence interval (CI): 7, 15) and 7% (95% CI: 4, 11), respectively. The most frequently affected personnel were nurses (48%, 95% CI: 41, 56), whereas most of the COVID-19-positive medical personnel were working in hospital nonemergency wards during screening (43%, 95% CI: 28, 59). Anosmia, fever, and myalgia were the only symptoms associated with HCW SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Among HCWs positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 40% (95% CI: 17, 65) were asymptomatic at time of diagnosis. Finally, severe clinical complications developed in 5% (95% CI: 3, 8) of the COVID-19-positive HCWs, and 0.5% (95% CI: 0.02, 1.3) died. Health-care workers suffer a significant burden from COVID-19, with those working in hospital nonemergency wards and nurses being the most commonly infected personnel."
6823,Evaluation of the auxiliary diagnostic value of antibody assays for the detection of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).,"The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. The goal of this study was to assess the diagnostic values of different methods of detecting and estimating the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the auxiliary diagnostic potential of antibody assays. By retrospectively analyzing the data of viral RNAs and serum immunoglobulin M-immunoglobulin G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from 38 cases with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, we found that, in the early phase of the illness, the viral RNA was most abundant in the sputum specimens, followed by that in the throat swabs, while the antibody assays identified fewer positive cases at this stage. However, the sensitivity of the antibody assays overtook that of RNA test from the eighth day of disease onset. Simultaneous use of antibody assay and reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction improved the sensitivity of the diagnoses. Moreover, we found that most of these cases with no detectable viral RNA load during the early stages were able to be seropositive after 7 days. Our findings indicate that the antibody detection could be used as an effective supplementary indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected cases with no detectable viral RNA, and in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in confirming the infection."
6824,Nanotechnology Responses to COVID-19.,"Researchers, engineers, and medical doctors are made aware of the severity of the COVID-19 infection and act quickly against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using a large variety of tools. In this review, a panoply of nanoscience and nanotechnology approaches show how these disciplines can help the medical, technical, and scientific communities to fight the pandemic, highlighting the development of nanomaterials for detection, sanitation, therapies, and vaccines. SARS-CoV-2, which can be regarded as a functional core-shell nanoparticle (NP), can interact with diverse materials in its vicinity and remains attached for variable times while preserving its bioactivity. These studies are critical for the appropriate use of controlled disinfection systems. Other nanotechnological approaches are also decisive for the development of improved novel testing and diagnosis kits of coronavirus that are urgently required. Therapeutics are based on nanotechnology strategies as well and focus on antiviral drug design and on new nanoarchitectured vaccines. A brief overview on patented work is presented that emphasizes nanotechnology applied to coronaviruses. Finally, some comments are made on patents of the initial technological responses to COVID-19 that have already been put in practice."
6825,[Vaccine against covid-19: an open question.].,"For covid-19, a disease that has proved fatal in many cases, a specific therapy has not yet been found, but the vaccine. This has triggered a further series of issues. Who to vaccinate first, how to achieve the so-called ""herd immunity"", especially if it is right, as it is being done, start with the medical staff and immediately after safeguard the elderly which also involve the problem of a clear explanation and acceptance, through informed consent, which it can be particularly difficult to illustrate."
6826,Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection-Induced Chilblains: A Brisk Perieccrine Inflammatory Response.,"The varying cutaneous and pathological manifestations of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) may have prognostic implications. Acral ischemic findings present with a hypercoagulable state in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Pathologically confirmed varicella-like exanthem and perniosis COVID-19 cases have correlated with paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic patients in previous reports. We present the second case of biopsy-proven COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains (pernio) in a paucisymptomatic patient with a brisk perieccrine lymphocytic response. Based on an antecedent pathological study, we know coronavirus particles have been seen in the eccrine gland associated with a brisk peri-inflammatory response. The prominent perieccrine inflammation is helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections. Currently, nonischemic pathological findings correlate with a good prognosis based on the paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic nature of their disease courses. Patients presenting with suspected COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains who are paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic should be isolated and immediately tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (as there is a delay in diagnosis based on the poor sensitivity of the current rapid test). We continue to stress the importance of early diagnosis and quarantining to prevent spread to the older and immunocompromised patients."
6827,Insights into SARS-CoV-2 Persistence and Its Relevance.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues to wreak havoc, threatening the public health services and imposing economic collapse worldwide. Tailoring public health responses to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic depends on understanding the mechanism of viral replication, disease pathogenesis, accurately identifying acute infections, and mapping the spreading risk of hotspots across the globe. However, effective identification and isolation of persons with asymptomatic and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections remain the major obstacles to efforts in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread and hence the pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of persistent viral shedding, reinfection, and the post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is crucial in our efforts to combat the pandemic and provide better care and rehabilitation to survivors. Here, we present a living literature review (January 2020 through 15 March 2021) on SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence, reinfection, and PASC. We also highlight potential areas of research to uncover putative links between viral persistence, intra-host evolution, host immune status, and protective immunity to guide and direct future basic science and clinical research priorities."

6829,Severe hyperphosphatasemia and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in children.,": It is now known that SARS-CoV-2 infection because of coronavirus is highly contagious and caused varying degrees of illness throughout the world. Hepatic dysfunction and the slight elevation of liver enzymes have been reported in cases of COVID-19 infection. Transient hyperphosphatasemia is a benign condition characterized by the elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase and the return to normal levels within weeks or months of first observation. We reported the first infant case of severe hyperphosphatasemia because of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a 9-month-old child admitted to the Pediatric Covid-19 Unit of Amiens University Hospital. Given the hepatic tropism and COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory reactions, our case suggests that, an isolated severe hyperphosphatasemia in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection should increase the possibility of transient hyperphosphatasemia, even if is also demonstrated a classic natural history of the transient hyperphosphatasemia during viral infection, especially in SARS-CoV-2 infection."
