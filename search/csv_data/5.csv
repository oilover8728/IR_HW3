40,Asymptomatic COVID-19 with ambiguous test results.,"Background: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is a significant part of the effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Mass testing of healthy individuals raises several issues, however, and the results can be challenging to interpret. Case presentation: A healthy 19-year-old man entered the military after two weeks of quarantine. The recruit had no respiratory symptoms or fever before, during or after his enrolment, and no history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. At enrolment, he had a positive rapid test and a venous blood sample showed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. PCR tests of specimens obtained from the upper respiratory tract were negative at enrolment and at week three, but were positive at week six. Interpretation: The overall assessment of all the tests indicates a probable asymptomatic infection. This case report illustrates the challenge of interpreting screening results in asymptomatic individuals."
41,Comparison of 2 fully automated tests detecting antibodies against nucleocapsid N and spike S1/S2 proteins in COVID-19.,"Automated assays for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics have recently come available. We compared the performance of the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG tests. The seroconversion panel comprised of 120 samples from 13 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. For the sensitivity and specificity testing, samples from COVID-19 outpatients >15 days after positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result (n = 35) and serum control samples collected before the COVID-19 era (n = 161) were included in the material. Samples for the detection of possible cross-reactions were also tested. Based on our results, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be quite reliably detected 2 weeks after NAAT positivity and 3 weeks after the symptom onset with both tests. However, since some COVID-19 patients were positive only with Elecsys®, the antibodies should be screened against N-antigen (Elecsys®) and reactive samples confirmed with S antigen (LIAISON®), but both results should be reported. In some COVID-19 patients, the serology can remain negative."
42,Dynamics of Blood Viral Load Is Strongly Associated with Clinical Outcomes in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"The prevalence and clinical relevance of viremia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been well studied. A prospective cohort study was designed to investigate blood viral load and clearance kinetics in 52 patients (median age, 62 years; 31 [59.6%] male) and explore their association with clinical features and outcomes based on a novel one-step RT droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR). By using one-step RT-ddPCR, 92.3% (48 of 52) of this cohort was quantitatively detected with viremia. The concordance between the blood and oropharyngeal swab tests was 60.92% (53 of 87). One-step RT-ddPCR was tested with a 3.03% false-positive rate and lower 50% confidence interval of detection at 54.026 copies/mL plasma. There was no reduction in the blood viral load in all critical patients, whereas the general and severe patients exhibited a similar ability to clear the viral load. The viral loads in critical patients were significantly higher than those in their general and severe counterparts. Among the 52 study patients, 30 (58%) were discharged from the hospital. Among half of the 30 discharged patients, blood viral load remained positive, of which 76.9% (10 of 13) completely cleared their blood viral load at follow-up. Meanwhile, none of their close contacts had evidence of infection. Quantitative determination of the blood viral test is of great clinical significance in the management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019."
43,Science's Response to CoVID-19.,"CoVID-19 is a multi-symptomatic disease which has made a global impact due to its ability to spread rapidly, and its relatively high mortality rate. Beyond the heroic efforts to develop vaccines, which we do not discuss herein, the response of scientists and clinicians to this complex problem has reflected the need to detect CoVID-19 rapidly, to diagnose patients likely to show adverse symptoms, and to treat severe and critical CoVID-19. Here we aim to encapsulate these varied and sometimes conflicting approaches and the resulting data in terms of chemistry and biology. In the process we highlight emerging concepts, and potential future applications that may arise out of this immense effort."

45,Summary of the Detection Kits for SARS-CoV-2 Approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China and Their Application for Diagnosis of COVID-19.,"The on-going global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been underway for about 11 months. Through November 20, 2020, 51 detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids (24 kits), antibodies (25 kits), or antigens (2 kits) have been approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA). Convenient and reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection assays are urgently needed worldwide for strategic control of the pandemic. In this review, the detection kits approved in China are summarised and the three types of tests, namely nucleic acid, serological and antigen detection, which are available for the detection of COVID-19 are discussed in detail. The development of novel detection kits will lay the foundation for the control and prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic globally."
46,Current Status of Diagnostic Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Future Developments: A Review.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 50.6 million individuals and caused over 1.2 million deaths globally, raising a major health concern. To date, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are therefore critical for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and optimizing clinical care, infection control, and public health interventions. The FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for hundreds of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of different classes. Whereas nucleic acid testing (NAT) such as RT-PCR remains the criterion standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, serological antibody and antigen tests are increasingly being developed. Tests based on the novel RNA sensing techniques (e.g., SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and Toehold Switch) are promising due to their relatively low cost, high accuracy, and rapid detection time. Diagnostic testing results for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted with caution, since they depend heavily on factors such as viral load, virus replication, the source and timing of sample collection, sample extraction, and characteristics of various testing methods. This review aims to present the current status of common diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, review the current regulatory requirements, and identify future directions in the development of improved diagnostics that are more accurate, accessible, and rapid."
47,Negative results in nucleic acid test of COVID-19 patients: assessment from the perspective of clinical laboratories.,"Since December 2019, there had been an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is prevalent around the world, and the number of infected cases has increased rapidly. Viral nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 can provide direct evidence for rapid diagnosis, disease course monitoring, and therapeutic efficacy. However, in practice, false-negative results in nucleic acid test are common, causing missed diagnoses, which are not conducive to the prevention and control of this outbreak. This article analyzes the possible causes and proposed measures to reduce the false-negative rate of nucleic acid test results and more effectively curb the outbreak."
48,Genetics and genomics of SARS-CoV-2: A review of the literature with the special focus on genetic diversity and SARS-CoV-2 genome detection.,"The outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, started in late 2019; in a short time, it has spread rapidly all over the world. Although some possible antiviral and anti-inflammatory medications are available, thousands of people are dying daily. Well-understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is not only essential for the development of new treatments/vaccines, but it also can be used for improving the sensitivity and specificity of current approaches for virus detection. Accordingly, we reviewed the most critical findings related to the genetics of the SARS-CoV-2, with a specific focus on genetic diversity and reported mutations, molecular-based diagnosis assays, using interfering RNA technology for the treatment of patients, and genetic-related vaccination strategies. Additionally, considering the unanswered questions or uncertainties in these regards, different topics were discussed."
