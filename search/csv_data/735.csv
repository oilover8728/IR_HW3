7340,Clinical characteristics and factors associated with COVID-19-related death and morbidity among hospitalized patients with cancer: a Swedish cohort study.,"Introduction: Cancer patients are considered to have a higher risk of dying and developing severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, there are few studies including co-morbidities and sociodemographic factors when investigating the outcome of COVID-19 in a cohort of cancer patients. In this study, we analyzed cancer patients that have been hospitalized due to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic in Sweden to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on mortality and morbidity. Patients and methods: We retrospectively collected data on all patients with cancer that were hospitalized due to COVID-19-related symptoms at Uppsala University Hospital and Karolinska University Hospital between 1 March and 31 August 2020. The primary endpoint was COVID-19-related death and the secondary endpoint was to describe COVID-19 severity, defined as symptom severity (grades 0-4) and length of stay (LOS) at the university hospitals. Results: In total, 193 patients were included among which 31% died due to COVID-19 and 8% died of other causes. In a multivariable analysis, older age >70 (OR 3.6; 95% CI [1.8-7.3], p < 0.001) and male gender (OR 2.8 [1.4-5.8], p = 0.005) were factors associated with higher likelihood of COVID-19-related death. Several comorbidities ≥2 (OR 5.4 [2.0-14.3], p = 0.001) was independently associated with COVID-19 severity. Treatment with chemotherapy within 90 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis were not associated with COVID-19-related death or severity. Conclusion: Factors associated with higher likelihood of COVID-19-related death were older age and male gender. More severe COVID-19 symptoms were seen in patients with multiple comorbidities. We did not see any associations between COVID-19-related death or severity and recent treatment including chemotherapy. In summary, this supports a thorough assessment regarding potential risks with COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer, with a combination of individual risk factors in addition to cancer treatments."
7341,"Automated, flow-based chemiluminescence microarray immunoassay for the rapid multiplex detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma (CoVRapid CL-MIA).","In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for rapid serological tests that allow multiplexing emerged, as antibody seropositivity can instruct about individual immunity after an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or after vaccination. As many commercial antibody tests are either time-consuming or tend to produce false negative or false positive results when only one antigen is considered, we developed an automated, flow-based chemiluminescence microarray immunoassay (CL-MIA) that allows for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein (S1 fragment), and nucleocapsid protein (N) in human serum and plasma in less than 8 min. The CoVRapid CL-MIA was tested with a set of 65 SARS-CoV-2 serology positive or negative samples, resulting in 100% diagnostic specificity and 100% diagnostic sensitivity, thus even outcompeting commercial tests run on the same sample set. Additionally, the prospect of future quantitative assessments (i.e., quantifying the level of antibodies) was demonstrated. Due to the fully automated process, the test can easily be operated in hospitals, medical practices, or vaccination centers, offering a valuable tool for COVID-19 serosurveillance.

7342,Relative Sensitivity of Saliva and Upper Airway Swabs for Initial Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Ambulatory Patients: Rapid Review.,"Saliva has been proposed as an alternative to upper airway swabs when testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although some studies have suggested higher viral loads and clinical sensitivity when testing saliva, studies have been relatively small and have given rise to contradictory results. To better understand the relative performance characteristics of saliva and upper airway samples, I performed a rapid systematic review (registered on PROSPERO as CRD42020205035), focusing on studies that included at least 20 subjects who provided diagnostic saliva and upper airway samples on the same day, which were tested by nucleic acid amplification methods and for which a confusion matrix could be constructed for based on a composite reference standard. Nineteen studies comprising 21 cohorts that met predetermined acceptance criteria were identified following a search of PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Seven of these cohorts were incorporated into a meta-analysis using a random effects model, which suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs are somewhat more sensitive than saliva samples for the diagnosis of early disease in ambulatory patients, such as in drive-through centers or community health centers. Nevertheless, the difference is modest, and the reduced need for personal protective equipment for saliva sampling may justify the difference. Conclusions are limited by the significant heterogeneity of disease prevalence in the study populations and variation in the approaches to saliva sample collection."
7343,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): current status and future perspectives.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, Central China, and has spread quickly to 72 countries to date. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [previously provisionally known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)]. At present, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has caused a large number of deaths with tens of thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, posing a serious threat to public health. However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for COVID-19. Intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, this review will focus on recent progress regarding the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the characteristics of COVID-19, such as the aetiology, pathogenesis and epidemiological characteristics."
7344,A whole blood test to measure SARS-CoV-2-specific response in COVID-19 patients.,"Objectives: To examine whether specific T-cell-responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides can be detected in COVID-19 using a whole-blood experimental setting, which may be further explored as a potential diagnostic tool. Methods: We evaluated interferon (IFN)-γ levels after stimulating whole-blood with spike and remainder-antigens peptides megapools (MP) derived from SARS-CoV-2 sequences; interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, eotaxin, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFN-γ, Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were also evaluated. Results: IFN-γ-response to spike and remainder-antigens MPs was significantly increased in 35 COVID-19 patients compared with 29 'no COVID-19' individuals (medians spike-MP: 0.26 vs 0, p = 0.0002; medians remainder-antigens-MP: 0.07 vs 0.02; p = 0.02). This response was detected independently of patients' clinical parameters. IFN-γ-response to SARS-CoV-2-unrelated antigens cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB) was similar in COVID-19 compared with 'no COVID-19' individuals (median CMV: 3.46 vs 5.28, p = 0.16; median SEB: 12.68 vs 15.05; p = 0.1). In response to spike-MPs in COVID-19- compared with 'no COVID-19' -individuals, we found significant higher median of IL-2 (50.08 vs 0, p = 0.0018), IFN-γ (90.16 vs 0, p = 0.01), IL-4 (0.52 vs 0, p = 0.03), IL-13 (0.84 vs 0, p = 0.007) and MCP-1 (4602 vs 359.2, p = 0.05). Conclusions: Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in a whole-blood assay is associated with COVID-19 and it is characterized by both Th1 and Th2 profile. This experimental approach may be useful for developing new T-cell based diagnostic tests for disease and vaccine settings."
7345,An Overview on the Common Laboratory Parameter Alterations and their Related Molecular Pathways in Screening for COVID-19 Patients.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the tissues expressing angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is used as a receptor for the virus to enter the cells. Once SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells, it leads to further events through signaling pathways. This pathophysiological condition can appear as changes in laboratory tests. Method: However, the lack of studies in this area is strongly felt. The present study was conducted to review the most common abnormalities in laboratory tests caused by COVID-19 and their related molecular pathways and outcomes. Results: It showed that the levels of IL-6, CRP, PCT, AST/ALT, bilirubin, ALP, GGT, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and neutrophils increased. Conversely, the levels of albumin and lymphocytes decreased. Since most of these parameters were related to hepatic function, their alterations indicated liver injury. Conclusions: Overall, the parameters CRP, D-dimer, and CBC are more important in diagnosis. Moreover, it seems that MAPK and NF-κB are the most frequent signaling pathways in which alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of the virus. Altogether, our review encourages researchers to study signaling pathways as potential molecular targets to achieve effective treatment."
7346,Vaccine hesitancy towards childhood immunizations as a predictor of mothers' intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.,"Background: Despite the success of childhood immunization in reducing vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccine hesitancy is now a global health threat to this achievement. The current COVID-19 pandemic may change the picture of vaccine hesitancy toward childhood immunizations, which could influence the mothers' intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. Aim: To measure the prevalence and related factors of vaccine hesitancy towards childhood immunization during the era of COVID-19 along with the prevalence of mothers' intention to vaccinate their children the future COVID-19 and its association with childhood vaccine hesitancy. Methods: Cross sectional study was conducted among 270 Saudi mothers attending outpatient clinics at King Abdullah University Hospital (KAAUH) in Riyadh by purposive sampling technique. Data were collected from January to February 2021 using SAGE Group standardized questionnaire. Results: Although most mothers strongly agree on the importance of the vaccine (79%), almost one-fourth of mothers were hesitant towards childhood immunization (24.31%). Similar percentage of mothers' intended to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 in the next 6 months was reported (24%). Vaccine hesitancy was found to be a significant predictor of mothers' intention. Mothers' education level was significantly associated with being hesitant towards childhood immunization as well as the intention to accept the future COVID-19 vaccine (p < 0.05). Main reason that was highly significantly associated with being hesitant is the concerns about the side effect (50%). Conclusion: The present study reported a considerable percentage of mothers who are hesitant towards childhood immunization which predicts their intension to vaccinate towards COVID19 and is associated with the level of education."
7347,Primary stratification and identification of suspected Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from clinical perspective by a simple scoring proposal.,"In this Commentary, we would like to comment on the article titled ""A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)"" as a featured article in Military Medical Research. In the guideline, except for ""confirmed cases"", ""suspected cases"", ""close contact"" and ""suspicious exposure"" were defined by clinical perspective based on epidemiological risk, clinical symptoms and auxiliary examination. Combined with our experience, we introduced a simple scoring proposal additionally based on not only CT imaging as strongly recommended by the guideline but also blood routine test, especially for primary screening of such patients in the out-patient department."
7348,"Adaptive, diverse and de-centralized diagnostics are key to the future of outbreak response.","The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has shaken our health care and economic systems, prompting re-evaluation of long-held views on how best to deliver care. This is especially the case for our global diagnostic strategy. While current laboratory-based centralized RT-qPCR will continue to serve as a gold standard diagnostic into the foreseeable future, the shortcomings of our dependence on this method have been laid bare. It is now clear that a robust diagnostics pandemic response strategy, like any disaster planning, must include adaptive, diverse and de-centralized solutions. Here we look at how the COVID-19 pandemic, and previous outbreaks, have set the stage for a new innovative phase in diagnostics and a re-thinking of pandemic preparedness."
7349,"SARS-CoV-2 Testing, Positivity Rates, and Healthcare Outcomes in a Cohort of 22,481 Breast Cancer Survivors.","Purpose: As health inequities during the pandemic have been magnified, we evaluated how use of SARS-CoV-2 testing differed by race or ethnicity in a large cohort of breast cancer survivors and examined the correlates of testing positive. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 22,481 adult breast cancer survivors who were active members of a large California integrated healthcare plan in 2020. We collected data on their breast cancer diagnosis, comorbidity, and demographic characteristics. We examined SARS-CoV-2 testing utilization between March 2020 and September 2020 by race or ethnicity, comorbidity, and other patient characteristics. We also examined the correlates of a having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify correlates of testing utilization and test positivity. Results: Of these 22,481 women, 3,288 (14.6%) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. The cohort included 51.8% women of color. Of the 3,288 tested, 264 (8.0%) women had a positive test result. In multivariable analyses, Latinx survivors were more likely (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.34) to undergo testing than White survivors; however, Asian or Pacific Islander survivors were 16% less likely to get tested (adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.94). Compared to White survivors, Latinx survivors were 3.5 times (adjusted OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.52 to 4.77) and Asian or Pacific Islander or Other survivors were 2.2-fold (adjusted OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.34) more likely to test positive. Being overweight (adjusted OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.72) or obese (adjusted OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.39 to 2.98) were also strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Conclusion: Even in an integrated healthcare system, Asian or Pacific Islander patients were less likely to undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing than White survivors, but more likely to test positive. Additionally, Latinx ethnicity and high body mass index were strongly correlated with a greater odds of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity."
