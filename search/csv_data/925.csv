9241,[Interrupting the chains of transmission of COVID-19 in Italy: survey among the Prevention Departments].,"Background: the ability to implement effective preventive and control measures is rooted in public health surveillance to promptly identify and isolate contagious patients. Objectives: to describe some organizational aspects and resources involved in the control of COVID-19 pandemic. Design: observational cross sectional study. Setting and participants: a survey of methods and tools adopted by the competent service (Prevention department) in the Local public health units (LHU) of the regional Health services has been performed in May 2020. The survey collected data related to activities carried out during the month of April 2020 on the surveillance system for collection of suspected cases, their virological ascertainment, the isolation procedures and contact-tracing activities by means of an online questionnaire filled in by the public health structure of the regional health system. A convenience sample of Prevention departments was recruited. Results: in 44 Prevention departments of 14 Regions/Autonomous Provinces (caring for 40% of the population residing in Italy), different services were swiftly engaged in pandemic response. Reports of suspected cases were about 3 times the number of confirmed cases in the same month. Local reporting form was used in 46% of the LHUs while a regional form was available in 42% of the Departments (in 9/14 Regions). In one fourth the forms were not always used and 2% had no forms for the reporting of suspected cases. Data were recorded in 52% of LHUs on local databases, while in 20% a regional database (in 7 Regions) had been created. A proportion of 11% did not record the data for further elaboration. The virological assessment with nasopharyngeal swabs out of the hospital setting was carried out on the average in 7 points in each LHU (median 5) and the average daily capacity was 350 (71 per 100,000) swabs. The rate of subjects newly tested during the month of April was of 893 per 100,000 new people. Data collected at the swabbing were recorded on a regional platform in 17 LHUs (39%) of 8 Regions. In 7% LHUs only positive specimens were recorded electronically. Local files were used in 27% LHUs. The interview with confirmed cases was carried out with a local questionnaire in 52% LHUs, while 14% stated that a standardized form was not used. The data collected about cases were recorded on a regional IT platform in 30% Departments (in 8 Regions) and in 41% data were registered only locally. For each confirmed case in April, a median of 4 contacts were identified. Only 13 (30%) Departments in 9 Regions have registered contact data on a regional database. Ten Departments (23%) have only hard copies, while 56% recorded data on local databases. About 5 health professionals for 100,000 resident population were involved in each LHU in each of the following activities as receiving reports of suspected cases, swabs collection, interviews of cases and contact identifications. Conclusions: the pandemic required rapidly a great organizational effort and great flexibility to increase response capacity, which now must be strengthened and maintained. Several different tools (forms and electronic files) have been developed in each LHU and used for the same surveillance operational processes with a loss in local efficiency. The inhomogeneous data collection and recording is an obstacle for further analyses and risk identifications and is a missed opportunity for the advancement of our knowledge on pandemic epidemiology analysis. In Italy, updating the pandemic response plans is the priority, at national, regional and local level, and the occasion to fill the gaps and to improve surveillance systems to the interruption of COVID-19 transmission."

9244,Analysis of natural compounds against the activity of SARS-CoV-2 NSP15 protein towards an effective treatment against COVID-19: a theoretical and computational biology approach.,"Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral infection caused by a novel coronavirus (nCoV), continues to emerge as a serious threat to public health. This pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) has infected globally with 1,550,000 plus deaths to date, representing a high risk to public health. No effective drug or vaccine is available to curb down this deadly virus. The expedition for searching for a potential drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is of massive potential and favour to the community. This study is focused on finding an effective natural compound that can be processed further into a potential inhibitor to check the activity of SARS-CoV-2 with minimal side effects targeting NSP15 protein, which belongs to the EndoU enzyme family. The natural screening suggested two efficient compounds (PubChem ID: 95372568 and 1776037) with dihydroxyphenyl region of the compound, found to be important in the interaction with the viral protein showing promising activity which may act as a potent lead inhibitory molecule against the virus. In combination with virtual screening, modelling, drug likeliness, molecular docking, and 500 ns cumulative molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns for each complex) along with the decomposition analysis to calculate and confirm the stability and fold, we propose 95372568 and 1776037 as novel compounds of natural origin capable of getting developed into potent lead molecules against SARS-CoV-2 target protein NSP15."

9246,Phylo-geo-network and haplogroup analysis of 611 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from India.,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from Wuhan China discovered in December 2019 has since developed into a global epidemic. Presently, we constructed and analyzed the phylo-geo-network of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across India to understand the viral evolution in the country. A total of 611 full-length genomes from different states of India were extracted from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative on 6 June, 2020. Their alignment with the reference sequence (Wuhan, NCBI accession number NC_045512.2) uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Furthermore, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. Remaining haplogroups had <10 identical sequences across a maximum of three states. Some states with fewer samples had more haplogroups. Forty-one haplogroups were localized exclusively to any one state. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India. Because the pandemic is still emerging, the observations need to be monitored."
