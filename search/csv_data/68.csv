671,"A Less Restrictive Policy for Liver Transplantation in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Positive Patients, Based Upon Cycle Threshold Values.","Coronavirus disease 2019 drastically impacted solid organ transplantation. Lacking scientific evidence, a very stringent but safer policy was imposed on liver transplantation (LT) early in the pandemic. Restrictive transplant guidelines must be reevaluated and adjusted as data become available. Before LT, the prevailing policy requires a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of donors and recipients. Unfortunately, prolonged viral RNA shedding frequently hinders transplantation. Recent data reveal that positive test results for viral genome are frequently due to noninfectious and prolonged convalescent shedding of viral genome. Moreover, studies demonstrated that the cycle threshold of quantitative RT-PCR could be leveraged to inform clinical transplant decision-making. We present an evidence-adjusted and significantly less restrictive policy for LT, where risk tolerance is tiered to recipient acuity. In addition, we delineate the pretransplant clinical decision-making, intra- and postoperative management, and early outcome of 2 recipients of a liver graft performed while their RT-PCR of airway swabs remained positive. Convalescent positive RT-PCR results are common in the transplant arena, and the proposed policy permits reasonably safe LT in many circumstances."
672,Estimating the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 with imperfect serological tests: Exploiting cutoff-free approaches.,"Large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method-referred to as mixture-model approach-for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test's ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods at exactly the low cumulative incidence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys."
673,"Application, Verification, and Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays with Emergency Use Authorization.","Interest continues to grow regarding the role of serologic assays for the detection of prior infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) status to many SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays. In this document, expert recommendations from clinical microbiologist members of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) concerning detailed verification strategies for SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays with FDA EUA are provided, as are insights into assay limitations and reporting considerations for laboratories. Assessments concerning single-antibody and multiantibody isotype detection assays, which may provide either differentiated or nondifferentiated (i.e., total antibody) antibody class results, are addressed. Additional considerations prior to assay implementation are also discussed, including biosafety, quality control, and proficiency testing strategies. As the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing is rapidly changing, this document provides updated guidance for laboratorians on application of these assays."
674,An Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 Dissemination Within a Skilled Nursing Facility Using Heat Maps.,"Objectives: To illustrate dissemination and asymptomatic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during a skilled nursing facility (SNF) outbreak. Design: Case report. Setting and participants: Residents of a 150-bed SNF. Measurements: Heat maps generated by the SNF's infection prevention team to track staff and resident symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test results to identify infection patterns. Results: The SNF experienced a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic. The initial cluster of residents with symptoms and the first confirmed case occurred on the SNF's dementia care unit. The insufficient availability and prolonged turnaround time of testing for both residents and staff at the outset of the outbreak prevented timely and accurate identification and cohorting of cases. Despite extensive other infection control measures being in place, SARS-CoV-2 disseminated widely through the facility within 3 weeks of the first confirmed case, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Conclusion: Early, rapid, universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of both SNF residents and staff at the outset of an outbreak and then repeatedly thereafter is critical to mitigate viral transmission. This will become even more important as states relax stay-at-home orders and SNF staff intermingle with communities that are increasingly mobile. Increased testing will inevitably result in more staff testing positive and having to self-quarantine at home, meaning that states must partner with SNFs and other long-term care providers to coordinate and support strategic staffing reserves that can supplement current frontline staff.

675,"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in an area of unrestricted viral circulation: Mass seroepidemiological screening in Castiglione d'Adda, Italy.","Castiglione D'Adda is one of the municipalities more precociously and severely affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Lombardy. With our study we aimed to understand the diffusion of the infection by mass serological screening. We searched for SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in the entire population on a voluntary basis using lateral flow immunochromatographic tests (RICT) on capillary blood (rapid tests). We then performed chemioluminescent serological assays (CLIA) and naso-pharyngeal swabs (NPS) in a randomized representative sample and in each subject with a positive rapid test. Factors associated with RICT IgG positivity were assessed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression models. Out of the 4143 participants, 918 (22·2%) showed RICT IgG positivity. In multivariable analysis, IgG positivity increases with age, with a significant non-linear effect (p = 0·0404). We found 22 positive NPSs out of the 1330 performed. Albeit relevant, the IgG prevalence is lower than expected and suggests that a large part of the population remains susceptible to the infection. The observed differences in prevalence might reflect a different infection susceptibility by age group. A limited persistence of active infections could be found after several weeks after the epidemic peak in the area."
676,The Nazareth Community Oncology Unit: The Oncology Nurse's Role to Provide Care in the Environment of COVID-19.,"The Community Oncology Unit (COU) in Nazareth, Israel, provides complete medical treatments to patients who live in the rural area of the country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, oncology nurses face additional challenges in facilitating cancer care. Pertinent adjustments are being made at the COU to maintain patients' safety and enable continuous oncology therapy by coordinating patients' COVID-19 testing and vaccination program."
677,Direct RT-PCR amplification of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples using a concentrated viral lysis-amplification buffer prepared with IGEPAL-630.,"The pandemic of 2019 caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is still rapidly spreading worldwide. Nucleic acid amplification serves as the gold standard method for confirmation of COVID-19 infection. However, challenges faced for diagnostic laboratories from undeveloped countries includes shortage of kits and supplies to purify viral RNA. Therefore, it is urgent to validate alternative nucleic acid isolation methods for SARS-CoV-2. Our results demonstrate that a concentrated viral lysis amplification buffer (vLAB) prepared with the nonionic detergent IGEPAL enables qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 by direct Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (dRT-PCR). Furthermore, vLAB was effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2. Since this method is inexpensive and no RNA purification equipment or additional cDNA synthesis is required, this dRT-PCR with vLAB should be considered as an alternative method for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2."
678,"Spatial scales, patterns, and positivity trends of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics in mass rapid antigen testing in Slovakia.","We study geographical epidemic scales and patterns and positivity trends of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics in mass antigen testing in Slovakia in 2020. The observed test positivity was exponentially distributed with a long scale exponential spatial trend, and its characteristic correlation length was approximately 10 km. Spatial scales also play an important role in test positivity reduction between two consecutive testing rounds. While test positivity decreased in all counties, it increased in individual municipalities with low test positivity in the earlier testing round in a way statistically different from a mean-reversion process. Also, non-residents testing influences the mass testing results as test positivity of non-residents was higher than of residents when testing was offered only in municipalities with the highest positivity in previous rounds. Our results provide direct guidance for pandemic geographical data surveillance and epidemic response management."
679,Undetectable viral RNA in oocytes from SARS-CoV-2 positive women.,"A central concern for the safe provision of ART during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the possibility of vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through gametes and preimplantation embryos. Unfortunately, data on SARS-CoV-2 viral presence in oocytes of infected individuals are not available to date. We describe the case of two women who underwent controlled ovarian stimulation and tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR on the day of oocyte collection. The viral RNA for gene N was undetectable in all the oocytes analyzed from the two women."
