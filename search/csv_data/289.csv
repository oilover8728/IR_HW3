2880,Absence of hypercoagulability after nCoV-19 vaccination: An observational pilot study.,"Background: It is still unknown whether COVID-19 vaccines induce a prothrombotic state or increase the hypercoagulable condition in subjects with a predisposition to thrombosis. Objectives: We evaluated the coagulation profile in a series of healthy subjects who received the first dose of the BNT162b2 or the ChAdOx1 vaccines and assessed whether hypercoagulability developed. Patients/methods: Volunteers among the staff of the University of Padua or health care professionals in the Padua University Hospital who had received either the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine in the previous 10 ± 2 days were eligible. A cohort of unvaccinated volunteers among family members of the University staff acted as control group. Global coagulation monitoring was assessed by whole blood rotational thromboelastometry, whole blood impedance aggregometry and thrombin generation. Platelet count was also obtained. Results: One hundred and ninety subjects were enrolled: 101 (53.2%) received the ChAdOx1 vaccine and 89 (46.8%) the BNT162b2 vaccine. Twenty-eight non-vaccinated subjects acted as controls. Thromboelastometry parameters were all comparable among groups. Thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP)-, ADP- and ASPI-induced platelet aggregation were similar among groups, as well as platelet count. Endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) was comparable among groups. The results were confirmed after controlling for age, gender and hormonal. Considering women taking combined oral contraceptives or thrombophilia carriers, no differences were detected in thromboelastometry or thrombin generation parameters between subjects who received ChAdOx1 vs. BNT162b2 vaccines. Conclusions: No significant activation of fibrinogen-driven coagulation, plasma thrombin generation or clinically meaningful platelet aggregation after ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccination was observed."

2883,After Action Reviews of COVID-19 response: Case study of a large tertiary care hospital in Italy.,"Background: After-Action Reviews (AARs) are management tools used to evaluate the response to public health emergencies at the national and subnational level. Aim of this study is to apply available AAR models to assess and critically appraise COVID-19 response of San Raffaele Scientific Institute, a large university hospital in Milan, Italy. Methods: We designed an AAR based on the key-informant interview format, following the methodology proposed by the 2019 World Health Organization Guidance for AAR. After systematic assessment of the hospital reorganization, we conducted 36 semi-structured interviews to professionals with executive, clinical, technical and administrative roles. We designed an ad-hoc questionnaire exploring four areas: (i) staff management; (ii) logistics and supplies; (iii) COVID-19 diagnosis and clinical management; (iv) communication. Results: Overall, the hospital response was evaluated as effective and sufficiently prompt. Participants stressed the relevance of: (i) strong governance and coordination; (ii) readiness and availability of healthcare personnel; (iii) definition of a model of care based on a multidisciplinary approach. Challenges were reported for communication management and staff training. Conclusions: This study is one of the first applications of the AAR to the COVID-19 response in hospital settings, which can be successfully adapted or scaled up to other settings in order to implement preparedness strategies for future public health emergencies."

2885,Highlight of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 vaccine development against COVID-19 pandemic.,"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has brought an unprecedented impact upon the global economy and public health. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virology has been gradually investigated, measures to combat this new threat in public health are still absent. To date, no certificated drug or vaccine has been developed for the treatment or prevention of coronavirus disease Extensive researches and international coordination has been conducted to rapidly develop novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Several major breakthroughs have been made through the identification of the genetic sequence and structural/non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which enabled the development of RNA-, DNA-based vaccines, subunit vaccines, and attenuated viral vaccines. In this review article, we present an overview of the recent advances of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the challenges that may be encountered in the development process, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches that may help in effectively countering COVID-19."
2886,"An outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) in a secondary care hospital in Finland, May 2021.","An outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) spread from one inpatient in a secondary care hospital to three primary care facilities, resulting in 58 infections including 18 deaths in patients and 45 infections in healthcare workers (HCW). Only one of the deceased cases was fully vaccinated. Transmission occurred despite the use of personal protective equipment by the HCW, as advised in national guidelines, and a high two-dose COVID-19 vaccination coverage among permanent staff members in the COVID-19 cohort ward."
2887,"Laboratory-based surveillance of COVID-19 in the Greater Helsinki area, Finland, February-June 2020.","Objectives: The aim was to characterise age- and sex-specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR sampling frequency and positivity rate in Greater Helsinki area in Finland during February-June 2020. We also describe the laboratory capacity building for these diagnostics. Methods: Laboratory registry data for altogether 80,791 specimens from 70,517 individuals was analysed. The data included the date of sampling, sex, age and the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result on specimens collected between 1 February and 15 June 2020. Results: Altogether, 4057/80,791 (5.0%) of the specimens were positive and 3915/70,517 (5.6%) of the individuals were found positive. In all, 37% of specimens were from male and 67% from female subjects. While the number of positive cases was similar in male and female subjects, the positivity rate was significantly higher in male subjects: 7.5% of male and 4.4% of female subjects tested positive. The highest incidence/100,000 was observed in those aged ≥80 years. The proportion of young adults in positive cases increased in late May 2020. Large dips in testing frequency were observed during every weekend and also during public holidays. Conclusions: Our data suggest that men pursue SARS-CoV-2 testing less frequently than women. Consequently, a subset of coronavirus disease-2019 infections in men may have gone undetected. People sought testing less frequently on weekends and public holidays, and this may also lead to missing of positive cases. The proportion of young adults in positive cases increased towards the end of the study period, which may suggest their returning back to social behaviour with an increased risk of infection."
2888,"Trace Element Zinc, a Nature's Gift to Fight Unprecedented Global Pandemic COVID-19.","With the advent of twenty-first century, we are in cruel grip of a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the associated illness being called as COVID-19. Since its outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, there are no medicines to cure the disease till date. Based on their experience, scientists say that developing a coronavirus vaccine could take at least a year. There are many steps in place before the vaccine comes for the distribution like its safety and cost-effectiveness, especially for the developing countries. In this scenario, the only way to prevent the disease is by following certain safety guidelines and to boost up the body's immune system. Zinc, a crucial trace element involved in several biological and metabolic processes, has been found to play a pivotal role in promoting and appropriately regulating the host defense mechanisms against viral infections. Zinc is naturally present in some foods, fortified in others and also available as dietary supplement. The current RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) of zinc is 12 and 10 mg for males and females respectively. Zinc is the second most common trace mineral after iron in the cell. It is present in all organs and tissues in the body as it forms catalytic component of all 6 classes of enzymes encompassing almost 2000 enzymes in the body. Zinc is biologically essential for cellular processes, including growth and development, as well as DNA synthesis and RNA transcription. Zinc deficiency results in a number of metabolic changes besides a compromised immune system. In this review, the role of zinc in regulating the host defense and viral replication is being discussed with the main focus on COVID-19."
