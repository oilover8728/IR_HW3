1550,"Why Does the SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC Spread So Rapidly? Universal Conditions for the Rapid Spread of Respiratory Viruses, Minimum Viral Loads for Viral Aerosol Generation, Effects of Vaccination on Viral Aerosol Generation, and Viral Aerosol Clouds.","This study analyzes the reasons the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta variant of concern (VOC) spreads so rapidly. Novel topics such as universal conditions for the rapid spread of respiratory viruses, minimum viral loads for viral aerosol generation, effects of vaccination on viral aerosol generation, and viral aerosol clouds were studied. The analyses were based on experimental results and analytic model studies. Four universal conditions, namely asymptomatic host, high viral load, stability of viruses in air, and binding affinity of viruses to human cells, need to be satisfied for the rapid spread of respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 and its variants such as the Alpha VOC and Delta VOC satisfy the four fundamental conditions. In addition, there is an original principle of aerosol generation of respiratory viruses. Assuming that the aerosol-droplet cutoff particle diameter for distinguishing potential aerosols from earthbound respiratory particles is 100 μm, the minimum viral load required in respiratory fluids to generate viral aerosols is ~106 copies mL-1, which is within the range of the reported viral loads in the Alpha VOC cases and the Delta VOC cases. The daily average viral loads of the Delta VOC in hosts have been reported to be between ~109 copies mL-1 and ~1010 copies mL-1 during the four days after symptom onset in 1848 cases of the Delta VOC infection. Owing to the high viral load, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC has the potential to effectively spread through aerosols. COVID-19 vaccination can decrease aerosol transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha VOC by reducing the viral load. The viral load can explain the conundrum of viral aerosol spreading. The SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC aerosol clouds have been assumed to be formed in restricted environments, resulting in a massive numbers of infected people in a very short period with a high spreading speed. Strong control methods against bioaerosols should be considered in this SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC pandemic. Large-scale environmental monitoring campaigns of SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC aerosols in public places in many countries are necessary, and these activities could contribute to controlling the coronavirus disease pandemic."

1552,Viral dynamics of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and applications to diagnostic and public health strategies.,"SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by viral proliferation and clearance phases and can be followed by low-level persistent viral RNA shedding. The dynamics of viral RNA concentration, particularly in the early stages of infection, can inform clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening. We used prospective longitudinal quantitative reverse transcription PCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals during the resumption of the 2019-2020 National Basketball Association season. For 46 individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases. According to our mathematical model, we found that viral RNA concentrations peaked an average of 3.3 days (95% credible interval [CI] 2.5, 4.2) after first possible detectability at a cycle threshold value of 22.3 (95% CI 20.5, 23.9). The viral clearance phase lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.9 days [95% CI 7.9, 14.4]) than for asymptomatic individuals (7.8 days [95% CI 6.1, 9.7]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR test substantially improves certainty about a patient's infection stage. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines substantially with test turnaround time. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations peak rapidly regardless of symptoms. Sequential tests can help reveal a patient's progress through infection stages. Frequent, rapid-turnaround testing is needed to effectively screen individuals before they become infectious."
1553,The Epistemology of a Positive SARS-CoV-2 Test.,"We investigate the epistemological consequences of a positive polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV test for two relevant hypotheses: (i) V is the hypothesis that an individual has been infected with SARS-CoV-2; (ii) C is the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of flu-like symptoms in a given patient. We ask two fundamental epistemological questions regarding each hypothesis: First, how much confirmation does a positive test lend to each hypothesis? Second, how much evidence does a positive test provide for each hypothesis against its negation? We respond to each question within a formal Bayesian framework. We construe degree of confirmation as the difference between the posterior probability of the hypothesis and its prior, and the strength of evidence for a hypothesis against its alternative in terms of their likelihood ratio. We find that test specificity-and coinfection probabilities when making inferences about C-were key determinants of confirmation and evidence. Tests with < 87% specificity could not provide strong evidence (likelihood ratio > 8) for V against ¬V regardless of sensitivity. Accordingly, low specificity tests could not provide strong evidence in favor of C in all plausible scenarios modeled. We also show how a positive influenza A test disconfirms C and provides weak evidence against C in dependence on the probability that the patient is influenza A infected given that his/her symptoms are not caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis points out some caveats that should be considered when attributing symptoms or death of a positively tested patient to SARS-CoV-2."

Methods: Whole blood by finger prick and serum samples were taken from HCW for use with 2 rapid lateral flow tests and an automated immunoassay. Results: Seventy-two HCWs were included, median duration between symptoms onset and serology sampling was 68 days. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected by rapid test in 11 HCW (15.3%) and confirmed in the 10 with available serum by the automated immunoassay. The frequency of ageusia or anosmia was higher in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.029, respectively). Conclusions: This study, among symptomatic HCW during the first wave in France, showed that 15% had IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2, a higher seroprevalence than in the general population. Rapid lateral flow tests were highly concordant with automated immunoassay."

Methods: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in April, June and August 2020 in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods. Participants were selected at random to provide blood for Elecsys immunoassay for detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibodies. A Bayesian regression model was used to estimate seroprevalence after adjusting for the demographic characteristics of each district. Results: In total, 3005 participants from 623 households were enrolled in this study. In Phase 2, adjusted seroprevalence was estimated as 8.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-13.1] and 15.1% (95% CI 9.4-21.7) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively, compared with 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.7) and 0.4% (95% CI 0-1.3) in Phase 1. In Phase 3, it was 12.8% (95% CI 8.3-17.7) and 21.5% (95% CI 15.6-28) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively. The conditional risk of infection was 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) and 0.41 (95% CI 0.28-0.52) in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods, respectively, in Phase 2. Similar trends were observed in Phase 3. Only 5.4% of participants who tested positive for COVID-19 were symptomatic. The infection fatality rate was 1.66%, 0.37% and 0.26% in Phases 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Conclusion: Continuing rounds of seroprevalence studies will help to improve understanding of secular trends and the extent of infection during the course of the pandemic."
