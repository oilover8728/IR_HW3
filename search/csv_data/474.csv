4733,Respecting freedom in the absence of compassion: realistic behavior by public officials for the COVID-19 vaccination program.,"The virtue of compassion is a valid antidote to lighten the burden of negative effects brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, real-life situations can attest that this is not always the kind of behavior for some people since the current situation is considered as 'survival of the fittest.' In its absence, the respect of freedom by public officials to every citizen is a great substitute most especially in the implementation of the government's vaccination program. This behavior actualizes every person's plan of protection without being pressured. This right needs to be provided and not taken away by the government."
4734,Severity and 1-month outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with solid cancers: a Danish nationwide cohort study.,"Background: Cancer patients are vulnerable to infections, are older and often have comorbidities in comparison to the general population, which increases the risk for severe outcomes related to COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: This study is a prospective, nationwide study in patients with solid cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection included between 10 March to 15 June 2020. Patient's baseline characteristics were collected. The study's primary outcome was overall survival within 30 days of verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission, admission to an ICU, and need for supplemental oxygen. Results: A total of 112 patients with a cancer diagnosis and verified SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. After one month of follow up, hospitalization was required for 54% (n = 61) and 21% of the patients had died and 14 of the 23 deceased cancer patients were ≥70 years. Most patients were classified with mild COVID-19 symptoms (66%, n = 74); however, 48% (n = 23) of the ≥70-year-olds patients were classified with severe or critical COVID-19 symptoms. Among the total study population, 61% (n = 68) had comorbidities and comorbidity were more frequently observed among the deceased (91%, n = 21) and older cancer patients (≥70 years, 81%, n = 39). Conclusions: Acknowledging the low sample size in this study, our work shows that age and comorbidities, but not recent cytotoxic therapy, are associated with adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection for patients with solid cancer. Particularly, patients with progressive disease seem to be at greater risk of a fatal outcome from COVID-19.HighlightsAge, performance status, and comorbidities are strong predictors of adverse outcome in cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Patients with progressive cancer disease seem to be at greater risk of a fatal outcome from COVID-19.Recent cytotoxic therapy, however, did not seem to be associated with increased risk for adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection for patients with solid cancer."
4735,SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics and transmission from community-wide serological testing in the Italian municipality of Vo'.,"In February and March 2020, two mass swab testing campaigns were conducted in Vo', Italy. In May 2020, we tested 86% of the Vo' population with three immuno-assays detecting antibodies against the spike and nucleocapsid antigens, a neutralisation assay and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Subjects testing positive to PCR in February/March or a serological assay in May were tested again in November. Here we report on the results of the analysis of the May and November surveys. We estimate a seroprevalence of 3.5% (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 2.8-4.3%) in May. In November, 98.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 93.7-100.0%) of sera which tested positive in May still reacted against at least one antigen; 18.6% (95% CI: 11.0-28.5%) showed an increase of antibody or neutralisation reactivity from May. Analysis of the serostatus of the members of 1,118 households indicates a 26.0% (95% CrI: 17.2-36.9%) Susceptible-Infectious Transmission Probability. Contact tracing had limited impact on epidemic suppression."
4736,Pitfalls of exceptions for COVID-19 travel quarantine: lessons from a dignitary visit to Thailand.,"A dignitary from a European country made an official visit to Thailand in November 2020. Due to the nature of this visit, a standard 14-day quarantine was not implemented. After a series of meetings with diplomats and hotel staffers, the dignitary was diagnosed with COVID-19. Here, we detailed the transmission and the genomic investigation from the visit, presenting the factors that need to be considered when a standard quarantine was waivered."
4737,Chest CT for Typical Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia: Relationship to Negative RT-PCR Testing.,"Some patients with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, the authors present chest CT findings from five patients with COVID-19 infection who had initial negative RT-PCR results. All five patients had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity (five patients) and/or mixed ground-glass opacity and mixed consolidation (two patients). After isolation for presumed COVID-19 pneumonia, all patients were eventually confirmed to have COVID-19 infection by means of repeated swab tests. A combination of repeated swab tests and CT scanning may be helpful for individuals with a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection but negative findings at RT-PCR screening."
4738,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is insufficient for the diagnosis of active or cured COVID-19.,"We assessed the performance of Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test device for the diagnosis of either active or cured COVID-19. Three cohorts of patients were chosen. Cohort 1, patients (n = 65) who attended the emergency department on March 30, 2020 with clinical suspicion of active COVID-19 (n = 56 with proven/probable COVID-19). Cohort 2, hospital workers (n = 92) who had either been (n = 40) or not (n = 52) diagnosed with proven/probable COVID-19 and were asymptomatic at the time of the sampling. Cohort 3, patients (n = 38) cared at the hospital before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Detection of serum antibodies was done using Abbott´s SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM device. Both methods showed 98% agreement for IgG detection. No antibodies were detected in the 38 samples from hospitalized pre-COVID subjects. The diagnostic performance of IgGs detected by Abbott´s SARS-CoV-2 assay in Cohorts 1/2 was: sensitivity (60.7%/75%) and specificity (100%/84.6%). The diagnostic performance of IgM by PanbioTM COVID-19 in Cohorts 1/2 was: sensitivity (16%/17.5%) and specificity (100%/98.1%). We show that IgG detection alone is insufficient for the diagnosis of active or cured COVID-19. IgM detection has a limited diagnostic value."
4739,The Repurposed Drugs Suramin and Quinacrine Cooperatively Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) In Vitro.,"Since the first report of a new pneumonia disease in December 2019 (Wuhan, China) the WHO reported more than 148 million confirmed cases and 3.1 million losses globally up to now. The causative agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide, resulting in a pandemic of unprecedented magnitude. To date, several clinically safe and efficient vaccines (e.g., Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines) as well as drugs for emergency use have been approved. However, increasing numbers of SARS-Cov-2 variants make it imminent to identify an alternative way to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. A well-known strategy to identify molecules with inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 proteins is repurposing clinically developed drugs, e.g., antiparasitic drugs. The results described in this study demonstrated the inhibitory potential of quinacrine and suramin against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro). Quinacrine and suramin molecules presented a competitive and noncompetitive inhibition mode, respectively, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments demonstrated that quinacrine and suramin alone possessed a moderate or weak affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro but suramin binding increased quinacrine interaction by around a factor of eight. Using docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we identified a possible binding mode and the amino acids involved in these interactions. Our results suggested that suramin, in combination with quinacrine, showed promising synergistic efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. We suppose that the identification of effective, synergistic drug combinations could lead to the design of better treatments for the COVID-19 disease and repurposable drug candidates offer fast therapeutic breakthroughs, mainly in a pandemic moment."
