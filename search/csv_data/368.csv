3670,COVID-19 Vaccination Intent and Perceptions Among Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at similar rates as the general population, and there was initial concern regarding potential for severe illness.1-4 Vaccinations were authorized for emergency use in the United States in December 2020 and aim to halt the spread of COVID-19. However, there are concerns that people will be hesitant to receive the vaccine for a variety of reasons including insufficient data in certain populations including those with IBD. We surveyed patients with IBD to identify potential concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination."
3671,The Possible Role of Sex As an Important Factor in Development and Administration of Lipid Nanomedicine-Based COVID-19 Vaccine.,"Nanomedicine has demonstrated a substantial role in vaccine development against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19). Although nanomedicine-based vaccines have now been validated in millions of individuals worldwide in phase 4 and tracking of sex-disaggregated data on COVID-19 is ongoing, immune responses that underlie COVID-19 disease outcomes have not been clarified yet. A full understanding of sex-role effects on the response to nanomedicine products is essential to building an effective and unbiased response to the pandemic. Here, we exposed model lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to whole blood of 18 healthy donors (10 females and 8 males) and used flow cytometry to measure cellular uptake by circulating leukocytes. Our results demonstrated significant differences in the uptake of LNP between male and female natural killer (NK) cells. The results of this proof-of-concept study show the importance of recipient sex as a critical factor which enables researchers to better consider sex in the development and administration of vaccines for safer and more-efficient sex-specific outcomes."
3672,Testing COVID-19 in Brazil: fragmented efforts and challenges to expand diagnostic capacity at the Brazilian Unified National Health System.,"Since the first recorded case of COVID-19 on February 26, 2020, Brazil has seen an exponential growth in the number of cases and deaths. The national testing approach has been insufficient to correctly use this tool in the support of containing the epidemic in the country. In this communication, we discuss efforts and challenges to scale-up COVID-19 testing at the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). This communication presents the initial results of the research project created to investigate the political, industrial, technological, and regulatory aspects that may affect the diagnostic and testing capacity for COVID-19 in Brazil. The paper draws on the review of academic literature, media publication, and collection of public data on tests purchase and regulation. It enlists initiatives to enhance PCR testing, national production and development of technologies, as well as regulatory measures to fast-track new tests. Our analysis indicates some points of reflection. Firstly, the lack of a consistent national strategy to fight COVID-19 exarcebated supply problems of diagnostic components. If the country was eventually able to circumvent this situation, it still faces a more structural dependency on the importation of diagnostic components. Secondly, the discontinued funding and distribution of tests may have implied health policy fragmentation and the growing importance of local governments and non-state actors to fighting the epidemics within SUS. Finally, initiatives established since the second semester of 2020 have expanded the testing capacity at SUS. However, it has not been sufficient to control the progress of the epidemic in the country."
3673,Adverse Reactions Following the First Dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine and BNT162b2 Vaccine for Healthcare Workers in South Korea.,"Background: We performed a prospective survey on the adverse reactions following the first dose of two types of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare workers (HCWs) in South Korea. Methods: HCWs at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, South Korea, received a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) or an mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) between March 5 and March 26, 2021. The HCWs were asked to report adverse reactions through a mobile self-report questionnaire for three days after vaccination. Results: A total of 7,625 HCWs received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine during the study period. Of them, 5,866 (76.9%) HCWs (ChAdOx1, n = 5,589 [95.3%]; BNT162b2, n = 277 [4.7%]) participated at least once in the survey, of whom 77% were female and 86% were younger than 50 years. The overall adverse reaction rate was 93% in the ChAdOx1 group and 80% in the BNT162b2 group (P < 0.001). Both local and systemic reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group, and the difference was larger in systemic reactions such as fever and fatigue. In the ChAdOx1 group, the incidence of adverse reactions was significantly higher in females and those in the younger age groups, while the BNT162b2 group showed such difference according to age. Conclusion: In our prospective survey, vaccine-associated adverse reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group than in the BNT162b2 group. Females and younger age groups experienced vaccine-associated adverse reactions more frequently."

3676,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Healthcare Workers of Kaunas Hospitals during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Background and objective: Serologic testing is a useful additional method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. It is also used for population-based seroepidemiological studies. The objective of the study was to determine SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers of Kaunas hospitals and to compare two methods for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Materials and Methods: A total of 432 healthcare workers in Kaunas hospitals were enrolled in this study. Each participant filled a questionnaire including questions about their demographics, contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, acute respiratory symptoms, and whether they contacted their general practitioner, could not come to work, or had to be hospitalized. Capillary blood was used to test for SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) a lateral flow immunoassay. Serum samples were used to test for specific IgG and IgA class immunoglobulins using semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results: 24.77% of study participants had direct contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. A total of 64.81% of studied individuals had at least one symptom representing acute respiratory infection, compatible with COVID-19. Lateral flow immunoassay detected SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG class immunoglobulins in 1.16% of the tested group. Fever, cough, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea, headache, conjunctivitis, muscle pain, and loss of smell and taste predominated in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive group. Using ELISA, specific IgG were detected in 1.32% of the tested samples. Diarrhea, loss of appetite, and loss of smell and taste sensations were the most predominant symptoms in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive group. The positive percent agreement of the two testing methods was 50%, and negative percent agreement was 99.66%. Conclusions: 1.16% of tested healthcare workers of Kaunas hospitals were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive. The negative percent agreement of the lateral flow immunoassay and ELISA exceeded 99%."
3677,Vaccine Hesitancy Against SARS-CoV-2 in Health Personnel of Northeastern Mexico and Its Determinants.,"With the emergence of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the need to find the determinants for its correct distribution is created, with health personnel being an essential group where coverage must be ensured. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an electronic survey that was distributed to health personnel in the state of Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Potential determinants for vaccine hesitancy were covered including their intention to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Results: A total of 543 responses were collected from health professionals, which 30 (5.5%) of the subjects stated that they would reject SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. How well informed the subjects were was the most determining factor, where misinformation related to vaccination and COVID-19 was the most important cause of vaccine rejection. Conclusion: The implementation of educational strategies for health personnel are required."
3678,Social media influencers can be used to deliver positive information about the flu vaccine: findings from a multi-year study.,"Large-scale digital flu vaccine campaigns have experienced difficulty increasing vaccination coverage among African Americans and Hispanics, and are routinely inundated by negative responses from vaccine opponents. A digital campaign employing user-generated content from social media 'micro' influencers who are predominantly followed by African Americans and Hispanics was implemented during the 2018-19 and 2019-20 flu seasons to disseminate positive information about the flu vaccine. At the time, this constituted the largest influencer-driven health campaign focused on these communities in the United States. Comments on posts were qualitatively coded to determine content perceptions among those exposed to posts. Digital metrics were also analyzed. During Year 1, posts reached 9 million+ social media users and generated 64 612 likes or shares, and 1512 responses. In Year 2, posts reached 8 million+ users and generated 155 600 likes or shares, and 3122 responses. Around 94% of public responses to posts were positive, suggesting this is a promising strategy to communicate health information and could shift social norms, particularly for heavily debated topics such as vaccination. This strategy represents a more community-led and participatory approach than most large-scale vaccination campaigns have attempted, with immediate applicability to communications about the COVID-19 vaccine."
