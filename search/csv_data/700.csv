6990,Extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 in children: a comprehensive review and pathophysiological considerations.,"Objective: The aim of this review was to summarize the most common extrapulmonary manifestations in pediatric patients with COVID-19, as well as to discuss clinical, epidemiological, and pathophysiological aspects of these clinical presentations in children. Source of data: An extensive search of literature was performed in order to identify pediatric cases with extrapulmonary manifestations between January 1, 2020 and June 21, 2020. Generic keywords, such as ""Novel coronavirus"" or ""Novel coronavirus 2019"" or ""2019 nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" were searched on PubMed database, associated either with age filters or generic pediatric terms. Summary of findings: A total of 28 articles, including 199 patients, were considered suitable to review and data extraction. The main findings were summarized in tables. The main non-pulmonary manifestations in pediatric patients, in decreasing order of frequency, were gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, neurological, hematological and lymphatic, cutaneous, hepatic, ocular, olfactory, and gustatory. Multisystem impairment and Kawasaki-like disease were also described. Conclusions: Differences in immune response of children and variations of tissue expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the virus receptor, are likely to influence clinical, epidemiological, and pathophysiological patterns of the disease."
6991,Acute Corneal Endothelial Graft Rejection With Coinciding COVID-19 Infection.,"Purpose: To report a case of acute corneal endothelial graft rejection with the concurrent onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. Methods: Case report. Results: A 31-year-old African American woman with a history of asthma, sleep apnea, obesity (body mass index of 40), and bilateral keratoconus was noted to have acute corneal endothelial graft rejection 3 months after uncomplicated penetrating keratoplasty of the left eye. The patient developed dysgeusia and subjective fever on the same day as ocular discomfort, and she was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 with only these 2 classic symptoms of the viral infection. Conclusions: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is known to cause conjunctivitis and has demonstrated transmissibility through ocular secretions. Acute immune and inflammatory dysregulations have been seen in cases of COVID-19 through various mechanisms. COVID-19 infection may potentially compromise ocular immune privilege contributing to acute corneal graft rejection."
6992,SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays Dependent on Dual-Antigen Binding Demonstrate Diverging Kinetics Relative to Other Antibody Detection Methods.,"Longitudinal studies assessing durability of the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) humoral immune response have generated conflicting results. This has been proposed to be due to differences in patient populations, the lack of standardized methodologies, and the use of assays that measure distinct aspects of the humoral response. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were serially measured in sera from a cohort of 44 well-characterized convalescent plasma donors over 120 days post-COVID-19 symptom onset, utilizing eight assays, which varied according to antigen source, the detected antibody isotype, and the activity measured (i.e., binding, blocking, or neutralizing). While the majority of assays demonstrated a gradual decline in antibody titers over the course of 120 days, the two electrochemiluminescence immunoassay Roche assays (Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 [qualitative, nucleocapsid based] and Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S [semiquantitative, spike based]), which utilize dual-antigen binding for antibody detection, demonstrated stable and/or increasing antibody titers over the study period. This study is among the first to assess longitudinal, rather than cross-sectional, SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles among convalescent COVID-19 patients, primarily using commercially available serologic assays with Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization. We show that SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is dependent on the serologic method used, which has implications for future assay utilization and clinical value."
6993,COVID-19: A Rural US Emergency Department Perspective.,"Several aspects led to the poor control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the US from a rural emergency department (ED) perspective. These include US residents' attitude towards political involvement in health and civil rights; lack of enough testing kits and rapid test results, or not available at all; and personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages. These obstacles related to medical supplies and resources, and lack of coordinated approach to the pandemic in the US, are important information for retrospective disaster research to understand study limitations, extrapolate accurate and valid data, and for other countries to understand how and why the US had higher numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other countries."
6994,The measles outbreak in Israel in 2018-19: lessons for COVID-19 pandemic.,"During 2018-2019 Israel saw some 4300 measles cases in a country-wide epidemic. Increased measles incidence rates and considerable disease burden have been observed in under-vaccinated communities, predominantly Jewish ultraorthodox. The measles epidemic, despite proper public health handling, revealed susceptible population subgroups as well as gaps and lacking resources in the Israeli public health systems. In the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, as of December 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases reported nationally was over 300,000 with approximately 3000 fatalities. Notably, minority groups such as the ultraorthodox Jewish community and the Arab community in Israel has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe it is still possible to implement the key lessons from the measles outbreak in Israel that could aid in the COVID-19 response in Israel and elsewhere. These conceptions should include a social-based approach, investment in public health human resources and infrastructure, tackling root causes of inequalities, emphasis on trust and solidarity, proactive communication, need for political will, and proper use of epidemiological data as a basis for decision-making. In parallel to proper use of COVID-19 vaccines, when available, a 'social vaccine' is crucial as well as preparedness and response according to public health principles."
6995,Sustained COVID-19 vaccine willingness after safety concerns over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.,"INTRODUCTION Prompted by reports of thromboembolic events - some with fatal outcomes - among people who had received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine from Oxford-AstraZeneca against COVID-19, a number of European countries paused vaccination with this vaccine in early and mid-March 2021. Prior studies have suggested that vaccine willingness is highly dependent on public trust in the safety of vaccines. We therefore investigated whether vaccine willingness dropped in the wake of the reported cases of thromboembolic events in relation to the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS Using longitudinal survey data from Denmark, we compared vaccine willingness shortly before and after the reported cases of thromboembolic events, as well as the perceived safety of the two most widely used COVID-19 vaccines in Denmark - those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - in the wake of these events. RESULTS We found sustained vaccine willingness after the reported cases of thromboembolic events (89% both before and after). However, the safety of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was perceived to be significantly and substantially lower than the safety of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech, and this difference was particularly pronounced among those who were vaccine-hesitant. CONCLUSIONS The vaccine willingness of Danes does not seem to have been affected by the reports of thromboembolic events in relation to the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. FUNDING The study was funded by a grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation (grant number: NNF20SA0062874). TRIAL REGISTRATION not relevant."
6996,Review of the SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and Analysis as Well as Prediction of Therapeutic Drugs.,"Due to the worldwide impact of SARS-CoV-2, people have carried out in-depth research on the virus to fight against this highly contagious disease. In this article, many articles published recently are summarized vertically, from the structure and sites of SARS-Cov-2, the mode of transmission, the mathematical model of transmission, the mechanism of the virus itself, the symptoms of patients after infection to medicine used in the early stage period and the prediction as well the analysis of probability in using new medicine."
6997,Development of COVIDVax Model to Estimate the Risk of SARS-CoV-2-Related Death Among 7.6 Million US Veterans for Use in Vaccination Prioritization.,"Importance: A strategy that prioritizes individuals for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination according to their risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality would help minimize deaths during vaccine rollout. Objective: To develop a model that estimates the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality among all enrollees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Design, setting, and participants: This prognostic study used data from 7 635 064 individuals enrolled in the VA health care system as of May 21, 2020, to develop and internally validate a logistic regression model (COVIDVax) that predicted SARS-CoV-2-related death (n = 2422) during the observation period (May 21 to November 2, 2020) using baseline characteristics known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, extracted from the VA electronic health records (EHRs). The cohort was split into a training period (May 21 to September 30) and testing period (October 1 to November 2). Main outcomes and measures: SARS-CoV-2-related death, defined as death within 30 days of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. VA EHR data streams were imported on a data integration platform to demonstrate that the model could be executed in real-time to produce dashboards with risk scores for all current VA enrollees. Results: Of 7 635 064 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 66.2 (13.8) years, and most were men (7 051 912 [92.4%]) and White individuals (4 887 338 [64.0%]), with 1 116 435 (14.6%) Black individuals and 399 634 (5.2%) Hispanic individuals. From a starting pool of 16 potential predictors, 10 were included in the final COVIDVax model, as follows: sex, age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and Care Assessment Need score. The model exhibited excellent discrimination with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 85.3% (95% CI, 84.6%-86.1%), superior to the AUROC of using age alone to stratify risk (72.6%; 95% CI, 71.6%-73.6%). Assuming vaccination is 90% effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2-related death, using this model to prioritize vaccination was estimated to prevent 63.5% of deaths that would occur by the time 50% of VA enrollees are vaccinated, significantly higher than the estimate for prioritizing vaccination based on age (45.6%) or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention phases of vaccine allocation (41.1%). Conclusions and relevance: In this prognostic study of all VA enrollees, prioritizing vaccination based on the COVIDVax model was estimated to prevent a large proportion of deaths expected to occur during vaccine rollout before sufficient herd immunity is achieved."
6998,Duration and key determinants of infectious virus shedding in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).,"Key questions in COVID-19 are the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding. Here, we report that infectious virus shedding is detected by virus cultures in 23 of the 129 patients (17.8%) hospitalized with COVID-19. The median duration of shedding infectious virus is 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5-11) and drops below 5% after 15.2 days post onset of symptoms (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.4-17.2). Multivariate analyses identify viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL (odds ratio [OR] of 14.7 (CI 3.57-58.1; p < 0.001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract. A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0.01 (CI 0.003-0.08; p < 0.001) is independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2. We conclude that quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays could be used in test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions."
6999,Mental Models of Infectious Diseases and Public Understanding of COVID-19 Prevention.,"The emergence of viral diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed considerable challenges to health care systems around the world. Public health strategy to address emerging infectious diseases has depended in part on human behavior change and yet the perceptions and knowledge motivating that behavior have been at times inconsistent with the latest consensus of peer-reviewed science. Part of that disjuncture likely involves the existence and persistence of past ideas about other diseases. To forecast and prepare for future epidemic and pandemic response, we need to better understand how people approach emerging infectious diseases as objects of public opinion during the periods when such diseases first become salient at a population level. In this essay, we explore two examples of how existing mental models of past infectious diseases appear to have conditioned and constrained public response to novel viral diseases. We review previously reported experiences related to Zika virus in Central America and discuss public opinion data collected in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of Zika virus disease, we assess how thinking about earlier mosquito-borne disease seems to have affected public consideration of the virus in Guatemala. In the case of COVID-19, we assess how previous vaccination behavior for a different disease is associated with intention to obtain vaccination for COVID-19 in the future."
