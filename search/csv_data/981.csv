9800,Cardiovascular Manifestations of COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in a group of patients who presented with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. A novel virus, now called SARSCoV- 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), was isolated from lower respiratory tract samples. The current outbreak of infection has spread to over 100 countries and killed more than 340,000 people as of 25th May, 2020. The predominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is a respiratory disease- ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to fulminant pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors are considered more susceptible to the virus, and these conditions are often worsened by the infection. Furthermore, COVID-19 infection has led to de novo cardiac complications, like acute myocardial injury and arrhythmias. In this review, we have focused on the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 infection that have been reported in the literature so far. We have also outlined the effect of pre-existing cardiovascular disease as well as risk factors on the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 infection."
9801,"Rapid Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Greater New York Metropolitan Area: Geolocation, Demographics, Positivity Rates, and Hospitalization for 46 793 Persons Tested by Northwell Health.","Background: In March 2020, the greater New York metropolitan area became an epicenter for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The initial evolution of case incidence has not been well characterized. Methods: Northwell Health Laboratories tested 46 793 persons for SARS-CoV-2 from 4 March through 10 April. The primary outcome measure was a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2. The secondary outcomes included patient age, sex, and race, if stated; dates the specimen was obtained and the test result; clinical practice site sources; geolocation of patient residence; and hospitalization. Results: From 8 March through 10 April, a total of 26 735 of 46 793 persons (57.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Males of each race were disproportionally more affected than females above age 25, with a progressive male predominance as age increased. Of the positive persons, 7292 were hospitalized directly upon presentation; an additional 882 persons tested positive in an ambulatory setting before subsequent hospitalization, a median of 4.8 days later. Total hospitalization rate was thus 8174 persons (30.6% of positive persons). There was a broad range (>10-fold) in the cumulative number of positive cases across individual zip codes following documented first caseincidence. Test positivity was greater for persons living in zip codes with lower annual household income. Conclusions: Our data reveal that SARS-CoV-2 incidence emerged rapidly and almost simultaneously across a broad demographic population in the region. These findings support the premise that SARS-CoV-2 infection was widely distributed prior to virus testing availability."
9802,Involvement of the nervous system in COVID-19: The bell should toll in the brain.,"The world is fuming at SARS-CoV-2 for being the culprit for causing the devastating COVID-19, claiming millions of lives across the globe in the form of respiratory disorders. But lesser known are its effects on the CNS that are slowly surfacing in the worldwide population. Our review illustrates findings that claim SARS-CoV-2's arrival onto the ACE2 receptors of neuronal and glial cells mainly via CSF, olfactory nerve, trigeminal nerve, neuronal dissemination, and hematogenous pathways. The role of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in its smooth viral infectivity of the host cannot be ignored, especially the spike proteins that mediate spike attachment and host membrane fusion. Worth mentioning the nucleocapsid, envelope, and membrane proteins make the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 much simpler than expected in spreading infection. This has led to catastrophic conditions like seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome, viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, acute cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory failures. Placing a magnifying lens on the lesser-explored CNS consequences of COVID-19, we attempt to shift the focus of our readers onto the new supporting threats to which further studies are needed."
9803,Recent advances in potential drug therapies combating COVID-19 and related coronaviruses-A perspective.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses responsible for the severe pathophysiological effects on human health. The most severe outbreak includes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The COVID-19 poses major challenges to clinical management because no specific FDA-approved therapy yet to be available. Thus, the existing therapies are being used for the treatment of COVID-19, which are under clinical trials and compassionate use, based on in vitro and in silico studies. In this review, we summarize the potential therapies utilizing small molecules, bioactive compounds, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, peptides, antibodies, natural products, and synthetic compounds targeting the complex molecular signaling network involved in COVID-19. In this review＞230 natural and chemically synthesized drug therapies are described with their recent advances in research and development being done in terms of their chemical, structural and functional properties. This review focuses on possible targets for viral cells, viral proteins, viral replication, and different molecular pathways for the discovery of novel viral- and host-based therapeutic targets against SARS-CoV-2."
9804,Air pollution particulate matter as a potential carrier of SARS-CoV-2 to the nervous system and/or neurological symptom enhancer: arguments in favor.,"Entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is expressed in nasal epithelial cells, and nasal delivery pathway can be a key feature of transmission. Here, a possibility of interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with air pollution particulate matter (PM) was considered. It was shown in our recent studies that water-suspended plastic and wood smoke aerosol PM and carbon-containing nanoparticles from burning organics can interact with the plasma membrane of brain nerve terminals presumably due to their lipid components. COVID-19 patients have neurological symptoms, viral particles were found in the brain, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells via fusion of lipid viral envelope with the plasma membranes of infected cells, and so viral envelop can contain lipid components of the host neuronal membranes. Therefore, interaction of SARS-CoV-2 envelope with PM is possible in water surrounding. After drying, PM can serve as a carrier for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 immobilized at their surface. Moreover, PM and SARS-CoV-2 per se can enter human organism during nasal inhalation, and they both use the same nose-to-brain delivery pathways moving along axons directly to the brain, influencing the nervous system and exocytosis/endocytosis in nerve cells. Thus, PM can aggravate neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and vice versa, due to their identical nose-to-brain delivery mechanism and possible interference of neuronal effects. In addition, different types of PM because of their ability to interact with the plasma membranes of nerve cells can facilitate unspecific SARS-CoV-2 entrance to the cells, and can influence envelope features of SARS-CoV-2. Detailed studies are required to analyze interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with PM."
9805,A Computer-Aided Drug Design Approach to Predict Marine Drug-Like Leads for SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibition.,"The investigation of marine natural products (MNPs) as key resources for the discovery of drugs to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic is a developing field. In this work, computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches comprising ligand- and structure-based methods were explored for predicting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. The CADD ligand-based method used a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) classification model that was built using 5276 organic molecules extracted from the ChEMBL database with SARS-CoV-2 screening data. The best model achieved an overall predictive accuracy of up to 67% for an external and internal validation using test and training sets. Moreover, based on the best QSAR model, a virtual screening campaign was carried out using 11,162 MNPs retrieved from the Reaxys® database, 7 in-house MNPs obtained from marine-derived actinomycetes by the team, and 14 MNPs that are currently in the clinical pipeline. All the MNPs from the virtual screening libraries that were predicted as belonging to class A were selected for the CADD structure-based method. In the CADD structure-based approach, the 494 MNPs selected by the QSAR approach were screened by molecular docking against Mpro enzyme. A list of virtual screening hits comprising fifteen MNPs was assented by establishing several limits in this CADD approach, and five MNPs were proposed as the most promising marine drug-like leads as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, a benzo[f]pyrano[4,3-b]chromene, notoamide I, emindole SB beta-mannoside, and two bromoindole derivatives."
9806,Meta-analysis on Serial Intervals and Reproductive Rates for SARS-CoV-2.,"Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze all literature reporting the basic reproductive number (R0), effective reproductive number (Re or Rt), and the serial interval (SI) values of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Summary background data: To assess the rate at which an infectious disease can spread in a population, the 2 measures, R0 and Re or Rt, are widely used. One of the parameters which influence the calculations is the SI, the period between symptom onset in an infector and an infectee. Methods: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct searching up to May 10, 2020, was performed. A continuous random-effect model was applied using the DerSimonian-Laird (inverse variance) method. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. Results: A total of 39 articles met the eligibility criteria. Our results demonstrated the mean SI was 5.45 days, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4.23 to 6.66. Pooled estimates for reproduction rates was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.69-3.59) for R0 and 3.18 (95% CI: 2.89-3.47) for Rt. Subgroup analysis by geographical region and date of publication revealed variations over both time and geography in calculated R0 and Rt values. As time has progressed, predicted R0 and Rt values had decreased globally. Conclusions: The study findings indicate that one SARS-CoV-2-infected person is likely to infect 3 persons, supporting that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease. As an essential objective metrics implied in risk assessment for this emerging pandemic, monitoring R0 and Re is necessary to indicate the effectiveness or failures of mitigation efforts."
9807,Abnormal movements in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A case series.,"Background: Abnormal movements in Covid-19 patients have been reported with varying degree of frequency, prompting neurologic consultation and additional diagnostic evaluation. We sought to evaluate the frequency and etiology of abnormal movements among hospitalized Covid-19 patients undergoing neurologic consultation. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the first 50 consecutive patients with confirmed Covid-19 hospitalized at our tertiary medical care center who underwent acute inpatient neurology consultation from March 2020 through May 2020. Indication for neurologic consultation and diagnostic studies performed were identified by electronic medical record review. Results: Of the 50 initial consultation requests, 11 (22.0%) patients were evaluated for abnormal movements (nine male and two female). Myoclonus was diagnosed in 6/11 (54.5%) patients. Additionally, two patients were diagnosed with seizures (confirmed on EEG in one), while two additional patients were diagnosed with tremor (physiologic and probable functional). A single case of serotonin syndrome was also identified. Conclusion: Abnormal movements observed in hospitalized Covid-19 patients can have a wide range of etiologies and were a frequent initial indication for neurologic consultation. Myoclonus was the most frequent type of abnormal movement observed. Early clinical recognition and directed diagnostic work-up is essential for accurate diagnoses in these patients."
9808,Nasal Swab as Preferred Clinical Specimen for COVID-19 Testing in Children.,"The first pediatric study demonstrating significantly higher positivity rate of nasal (mid-turbinate) swab testing over oropharyngeal swab testing in detecting SARS-CoV-2 (Fisher exact test 0.046, Cohen K 0.43, confidence interval 95%, 0.014-0.855). Benefits might include lower collection-related hazard for healthcare workers. We recommend it as preferred choice for swab-based SARS-CoV-2 testing in children."
9809,The art of the possible in approaching efficacy trials for COVID19 convalescent plasma.,"COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is widely used as a treatment. While safety data are enough, high-level evidences of efficacy are still missing. We summarize here the results from randomized controlled trials (RCT) published to date and analyze their flaws and biases. We then provide suggestions for next round of CCP RCTs, discussing specification of CCP, therapeutic dose, timing, control arm, disease stage, and outcome measures."
