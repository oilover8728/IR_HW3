2631,Development of a Colloidal Gold-Based Immunochromatographic Strip for Rapid Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Spike Protein.,"The outbreak and worldwide pandemic of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have a significant impact on global economy and human health. In order to reduce the disease spread, 16 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) again SARS-CoV-2 were generated by immunized mice with the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), which was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO). A colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip was developed with two McAbs to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which can play a potential role in monitoring vaccine quality. The strip is highly specific, detecting only SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and does not show any non-specific reactions with syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and other coronavirus and influenza viruses. The strip detected subunit vaccine in our laboratory with a detection limit of spike protein of 62.5 ng/mL. This strip provides an effective method in monitoring vaccine quality by detecting the antigen content of spike protein."
2632,A 24-Year-Old Man With Hemoptysis Found to Have a Chest Mass and Contralateral Axillary Lymphadenopathy.,"A 24-year-old man, never smoker, with no medical or surgical history, not currently on medications, presented to the ED with a second episode of gross hemoptysis, 4 months after an initial episode that had not previously been evaluated. He described the current episode of hemoptysis as ""enough to fill the sink""; however, he did not further quantify. He has no history of recurrent epistaxis, hematemesis, or other evidence of clotting disorder. He denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, or recent travel. He denied any sick contacts and has no history of TB exposure or risk factors. The patient denied any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain. He had no lower extremity pain or swelling. He routinely exercises and generally lives a healthy lifestyle. He is a health care worker who has not routinely worked with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he received his second (of two) COVID-19 vaccines 4 days before presentation."

2634,SARS-CoV-2 infection: Understanding the immune system abnormalities to get an adequate diagnosis.,"COVID-19 is the current pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that emerged from China at the end of December 2019. The scientific community is making extraordinary efforts to understand the virus structure and the pathophysiology and immunological processes activated in the host, in order to identify biomarkers, diagnostic tools, treatments, and vaccines to decrease COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Various abnormalities have been noted during SARS-CoV-2 infection both in lymphoid and myeloid cells. Such abnormalities may disturb the immune system function and cause a massive inflammatory response that impairs tissue function. This review discusses the close relationship between the immune system abnormalities and the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, including fibrosis, in the context of COVID-19 disease. Moreover, we described the current strategies for COVID-19 diagnosis, and we provide a summary of the most useful clinical laboratory parameters to identify severe COVID-19 patients."
2635,[Prediction of the epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 by immunoinformatics].,"Objective To predict the epitopes of B cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and T helper (Th) cells of SARS-CoV-2 by immunoinformatics. Methods The SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were retrieved from NCBI database and screened, and the sequences with antigenicity ≥0.5 and amino acid number ≥100 were used for epitopes prediction. The Phyre2 server was used to predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure, the GalaxyRefine system to optimize the 3D structure, and the SWISS-MODEL system to evaluate the accuracy of the optimized structure. The CTL, Th cells, and sequential B-cell antigen peptide prediction was based on the sequences of proteins, and the structural B-cell antigen peptide prediction on the 3D structures of proteins. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and Th cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted by the IEDB database. The sequential B-cell antigen peptide prediction and the structural B-cell antigen peptide prediction were performed by BepiPred-2.0: Sequential B-Cell Epitope Predictor and ElliPro-a structure-based tool for the prediction of epitopes, respectively. Results Twenty seven SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI database. After removing the proteins with antigenicity <0.5 and amino acid number <100, nine proteins were selected for antigen peptide prediction. Finally, 24 epitopes from CTLs, 20 epitopes from Th cells, and 12 sequential epitopes and 16 structural epitopes from B cells were obtained. Conclusion The epitopes obtained can be used for developing multi-epitope SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Compared with epitopes that only target a single protein, multi-target epitopes have stronger immunogenicity. These epitopes have certain reference value for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."
2636,Primed for global coronavirus pandemic: Emerging research and clinical outcome.,"The global effort to combat and contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now proceeding on a war footing. The world was slow to react to the developing crisis, but once the contours of the impending calamity became evident, the different state and non-state actors have raced to put their act together. The COVID-19 pandemic has blatantly exposed the shortcomings of our healthcare system and the limitations of medical science, despite considerable advances in recent years. To effectively tackle the current pandemic, almost unprecedented in the modern age, there is an urgent need for a concerted, sustained, and coordinated effort towards the development of new diagnostics, therapeutic and vaccines, and the ramping up of the healthcare infrastructure, especially in the poorer underprivileged nations. Towards this end, researchers around the world are working tirelessly to develop new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Efforts to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 are presently underway in several countries around the world, but a new vaccine is expected only by the end of the year-at the earliest. New drug development against COVID-19 and its approval may take even longer. Under such circumstances, drug repurposing has emerged as a realistic and effective strategy to counter the current menace, and several antiviral and antimalarial medicines are currently in different stages of clinical trials. Researchers are also experimenting with nutrients, vitamins, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma as immunity boosters against the SARS-CoV-2. This report presents a critical analysis of the global clinical trial landscape for COVID-19 with an emphasis on the therapeutic agents and vaccines currently being tested at pandemic speed."
2637,The emerging role of probiotics as a mitigation strategy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infection accompanied by pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has affected millions of people globally. To date, there are no highly efficient therapies for this infection. Probiotic bacteria can interact with the gut microbiome to strengthen the immune system, enhance immune responses, and induce appropriate immune signaling pathways. Several probiotics have been confirmed to reduce the duration of bacterial or viral infections. Immune fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections can be reinforced. In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in fighting viral infections. Thus, probiotics have emerged as suitable candidates for controlling these infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, any approach with the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic reactions could potentially be useful. Here, we summarize findings regarding the effectiveness of various probiotics for preventing virus-induced respiratory infectious diseases, especially those that could be employed for COVID-19 patients. However, the benefits of probiotics are strain-specific, and it is necessary to identify the bacterial strains that are scientifically established to be beneficial."
2638,COVID-19 vaccine is here: practical considerations for clinical imaging applications.,"Imaging tools are potentially able to provide valuable data regarding the development of an efficient vaccine against viral diseases. Tracking immune cells in vivo by imaging modalities can help us understand the intrinsic behaviors of immune cells in response to vaccine components. Imaging patterns at the vaccination site and draining lymph nodes might provide useful information about the vaccine potency. Besides, serial lung CT imaging has been purposed to evaluate vaccine efficiency regarding its protection against typical lung lesions of viral pneumonias. On the other hand, vaccination causes various confusing radiologic patterns that pose diagnostic challenges for clinicians and pitfalls for reading radiologists. This manuscript reviews potential applications of imaging modalities in the process of vaccine development and also goes over some of the imaging findings/pitfalls following vaccination."
2639,"Rapid, Ultrasensitive, and Highly Specific Diagnosis of COVID-19 by CRISPR-Based Detection.","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has rapidly spread leading to a global pandemic. Here, we combined multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) with CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection to develop a novel diagnostic test (MCCD) and applied for the diagnosis of COVID-19, called COVID-19 MCCD. The MCCD protocol conducts reverse transcription MCDA (RT-MCDA) reaction for RNA templates followed by CRISPR-Cas12a/CrRNA complex detection of predefined target sequences after which degradation of a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) molecule confirms detection of the target sequence. Two MCDA primer sets and two CrRNAs were designed targeting the opening reading frame 1a/b (ORF1ab) and nucleoprotein (N) of SARS-CoV-2. The optimal conditions include two RT-MCDA reactions at 63 °C for 35 min and a CRISPR-Cas12a/CrRNA detection reaction at 37 °C for 5 min. The COVID-19 MCCD assay can be visualized on a lateral flow biosensor (LFB) and completed within 1 h including RNA extraction (15 min), RT-MCDA reaction (35 min), CRISPR-Cas12a/CrRNA detection reaction (5 min), and reporting of result (within 2 min). The COVID-19 MCCD assay is very sensitive and detects the target gene with as low as seven copies per test and does not cross-react with non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 37 of 37 COVID-19 patient samples, and nonpositive results were detected from 77 non-COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the COVID-19 MCCD assay is a useful tool for the reliable and quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
