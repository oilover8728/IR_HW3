4320,COVID-19 vaccination intent among London healthcare workers.,"Background: The 10-month timeline from conception to regulatory approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented in modern medicine. However, the climate of the pandemic has also seen anti-vaccination sentiments flourish. Aims: To determine the intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust and examine variation in uptake between demographic groups. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey open to staff working at the trust. Staff rated on a five-point scale the likelihood of them accepting COVID-19 vaccination. Results: We received 514 responses, representing 16% of the workforce. About 59% of staff intended to seek vaccination, 24% to reject and 17% were unsure. There was significantly reduced intended uptake in females, younger age groups, healthcare assistants, nurses, staff of black ethnic backgrounds and those who rejected influenza vaccination. Safety was the dominant concern. Conclusions: Our study finds COVID-19 vaccinate hesitancy is prevalent among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust. It is particularly concerning that hesitancy was highest amongst groups most exposed to COVID-19 and most at risk of severe disease. Reasons behind disparities in uptake must be addressed to protect staff and prevent deepening inequalities within the healthcare workforce."
4321,Problems of Interpreting Diagnostic Tests for SARS-CoV-2: Analytical Chemistry Concerns.,"The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak made the development of reliable, sensitive, and reproducible testing methods crucial throughout the world. Without proper analytical validation, testing results can be misinterpreted, leading to a certain degree of misinformation in the clinical area. To accurately assess the methods, the determination of an analytical linear range of response of the assay is fundamental. Based on this curve, the evaluation of some parameters as sensitivity, limit of detection, and limit of quantification can be done, as well as the establishment of cut-off values. Statistical treatments of the collected data can be performed for reproducibility and reliability evaluations. In this context, there is a wide range of analytical concerns that should be in-depth discussed in medical, biomedical and chemical areas. This letter aims to briefly clarify some analytical chemistry concepts, as sensitivity, cut-off and limit of detection, and their application towards clinical diagnosis."
4322,mRNA vaccine for cancer immunotherapy.,"mRNA vaccines have become a promising platform for cancer immunotherapy. During vaccination, naked or vehicle loaded mRNA vaccines efficiently express tumor antigens in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), facilitate APC activation and innate/adaptive immune stimulation. mRNA cancer vaccine precedes other conventional vaccine platforms due to high potency, safe administration, rapid development potentials, and cost-effective manufacturing. However, mRNA vaccine applications have been limited by instability, innate immunogenicity, and inefficient in vivo delivery. Appropriate mRNA structure modifications (i.e., codon optimizations, nucleotide modifications, self-amplifying mRNAs, etc.) and formulation methods (i.e., lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymers, peptides, etc.) have been investigated to overcome these issues. Tuning the administration routes and co-delivery of multiple mRNA vaccines with other immunotherapeutic agents (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) have further boosted the host anti-tumor immunity and increased the likelihood of tumor cell eradication. With the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of LNP-loaded mRNA vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 and the promising therapeutic outcomes of mRNA cancer vaccines achieved in several clinical trials against multiple aggressive solid tumors, we envision the rapid advancing of mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy in the near future. This review provides a detailed overview of the recent progress and existing challenges of mRNA cancer vaccines and future considerations of applying mRNA vaccine for cancer immunotherapies."

4324,Medical Oncology Group of Australia position statement: COVID-19 vaccination in patients with solid tumours.,"People with cancer are vulnerable to increased morbidity and mortality from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 vaccination is key to protecting the population of people with cancer from adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Medical Oncology Group of Australia aimed to address the considerations around COVID-19 vaccination in people with cancer, in particular, safety and efficacy of vaccination. The assessment of patients with generalised allergic reaction to anti-cancer therapy containing vaccine components and practical implementation of vaccination of people on active anti-cancer therapy are also discussed."

4328,Burn Unit admission and management protocol during COVID-19 pandemic.,"Background: The actual epidemic outbreak is the third time in the last two decades in which a coronavirus results in a major global spread with serious consequences in terms of vastity of affected patients, life losses, health system organization efforts and socio-economic implications. Lacking effective therapies and vaccinations, during viral outbreak the major and most incisive mean for viral spread control is spread prevention, especially for the fragile burn-injured patients we are called to care for in Burn Units. Methods: We developed an admission and inpatient management protocol to preserve burn patients from SARS-CoV-2 contagion, in order to avoid additional morbidity and mortality in patients with already compromised health conditions. Data from burn-injured patients admitted to our Unit following this new protocol were retrospectively analyzed in order to verify its effectiveness in prevention of viral spread. Results: From the 8th of March to the 8th of June, we admitted 18 patients in the Burn Unit ICU and semi-ICU and 17 patients in the Burn Ward. Two of them resulted positive to COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage collected immediately on admission, for both the extension of burns and their general clinical conditions implied ICU admission. Moreover, a caregiver of an admitted child resulted positive to the nasopharyngeal swab. No other cases of SARS-CoV-2 positivity have been reported neither between hospitalized patients nor between healthcare workers. Conclusion: The evidence of high ICU admission rate and high mortality in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 combined with the fragile clinical conditions of burn patients required the development of an admission and hospitalization management protocol."
4329,An imperfect test for a virus can Be worse than No test at all.,"This note studies the effect of the availability of a test for a virus on the public health of a population. It is shown by example that the existence of a freely available and moderately informative test for a virus may lower society's welfare in comparison to the case where no test exists or access to the test is restricted. In this setting, any test provided to any subset of agents who would find it optimal not to isolate absent the test improves welfare."
