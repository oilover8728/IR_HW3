2710,Complementary methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in times of material shortage.,"The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 resulted in increasing demands for diagnostic tests, leading to a shortage of recommended testing materials and reagents. This study reports on the performance of self-sampled alternative swabbing material (ordinary Q-tips tested against flocked swab and rayon swab), of reagents for classical RNA extraction (phenol/guanidine-based protocol against a commercial kit), and of intercalating dye-based one-step quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCRs (RT-qPCR) compared against the gold standard hydrolysis probe-based assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The study found sampling with Q-tips, RNA extraction with classical protocol and intercalating dye-based RT-qPCR as a reliable and comparably sensitive strategy for detection of SARS-CoV-2-particularly valuable in the current period with a resurgent and dramatic increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections and growing shortage of diagnostic materials especially for regions limited in resources."
2711,"No-jab, no-job clause: ethical issues and legal impediments.","Vaccination is considered to be one of the greatest public health achievements in the 20th century. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered a worldwide debate and legal exemption of vaccination and its possible consequences. Now that COVID-19 vaccination programme has started, there is immense pressure from the general public. Following the recent correspondence where the authors have rightly stated the need to take seriously the ethical issues under the COVID-19 vaccination, this paper highlights the ethical and legal impediments of 'no-jab, no-job clause' arising in many countries."

2713,Evaluation of High-Throughput Serological Tests for SARS-CoV-2.,"Serologic methods are an important part of a clinical laboratory's portfolio of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests and are essential to the broader response to coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), including epidemiological studies and vaccine development. There are currently a number of commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests with emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, H. E. Prince, T. S. Givens, M. Lapé-Nixon, N. J. Clarke, et al. (J Clin Microbiol 58:e01742-20, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01742-20, 2020) report the results of their evaluation of the agreement of 4 high-throughput EUA tests for SARS-CoV-2 IgG: Abbott Architect, DiaSorin Liaison, Euroimmun, and Ortho Vitros. They showed excellent agreement between the tests and rare false-positive reactivity for all tests."
2714,Significance of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody testing during COVID-19 vaccine allocation.,"Objective: To assess the value of using SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody testing to prioritize the vaccination of susceptible individuals as part of a COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan when vaccine supply is limited. Methods: An extended susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread when considering diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination of a cohort of 1 million individuals. The scenarios modeled represented 4 pandemic severity scenarios and various times when the vaccine becomes available during the pandemic. Eligible individuals have a probability p of receiving antibody testing prior to vaccination (p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). The vaccine was modeled as a single dose vaccine with 90% and 70% efficacy. The value of serology testing was evaluated by comparing the infection attack rate, peak infections, peak day, and deaths. Results: The use of antibody testing to prioritize the allocation of limited vaccines reduces infection attack rates and deaths. The size of the reduction depends on when the vaccine becomes available relative to the infection peak day. The largest percentage reduction in cases and deaths occurs when the vaccine is deployed before and close to the infection peak day. The reduction in the number of cases and deaths diminishes as vaccine deployment is delayed. Conclusions: Antibody testing as part of the vaccination plan is an effective method to maximize the benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine. Decision-makers need to consider relative timing between the infection peak day and when the vaccine becomes available."

This is the first phase IV immunogenicity study to recruit a large number of Greek healthcare workers (n=425) including 63 previously-infected subjects. We measured titres of neutralizing IgGs against the receptor-binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 14 days post-immunization with the first dose, employing the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay. A total of 92.24 % of our study cohort received a positive assay outcome and titres varied with age. Post-hoc analysis revealed that although titres did not significantly differ among participants aged 20-49 years, a significant decline was marked in the age group of 50-59 years, which was further accentuated in subjects aged over 60. Antibody titres escalated significantly among the previously-infected, indicating the potential booster effect of the first dose in that group."
2717,Determinants of COVID-19 Mortality in Patients With Cancer From a Community Oncology Practice in Brazil.,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health emergency of global concern. Determinants of mortality in the general population are now clear, but specific data on patients with cancer remain limited, particularly in Latin America. Materials and methods: A longitudinal multicenter cohort study of patients with cancer and confirmed COVID-19 from Oncoclínicas community oncology practice in Brazil was conducted. The primary end point was all-cause mortality after isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in patients initially diagnosed in an outpatient environment. We performed univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis and recursive partitioning modeling to define the baseline clinical determinants of death in the overall population. Results: From March 29 to July 4, 2020, 198 patients with COVID-19 were prospectively registered in the database, of which 167 (84%) had solid tumors and 31 (16%) had hematologic malignancies. Most patients were on active systemic therapy or radiotherapy (77%), largely for advanced or metastatic disease (64%). The overall mortality rate was 16.7% (95% CI, 11.9 to 22.7). In univariate models, factors associated with death after COVID-19 diagnosis were age ≥ 60 years, current or former smoking, coexisting comorbidities, respiratory tract cancer, and management in a noncurative setting (P < .05). In multivariable logistic regression and recursive partitioning modeling, only age, smoking history, and noncurative disease setting remained significant determinants of mortality, ranging from 1% in cancer survivors under surveillance or (neo)adjuvant therapy to 60% in elderly smokers with advanced or metastatic disease. Conclusion: Mortality after COVID-19 in patients with cancer is influenced by prognostic factors that also affect outcomes of the general population. Fragile patients and smokers are entitled to active preventive measures to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and close monitoring in the case of exposure or COVID-19-related symptoms."

2719,Exploring beyond clinical routine SARS-CoV-2 serology using MultiCoV-Ab to evaluate endemic coronavirus cross-reactivity.,"The humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is a benchmark for immunity and detailed analysis is required to understand the manifestation and progression of COVID-19, monitor seroconversion within the general population, and support vaccine development. The majority of currently available commercial serological assays only quantify the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response against individual antigens, limiting our understanding of the immune response. To overcome this, we have developed a multiplex immunoassay (MultiCoV-Ab) including spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic human coronaviruses. Compared to three broadly used commercial in vitro diagnostic tests, our MultiCoV-Ab achieves a higher sensitivity and specificity when analyzing a well-characterized sample set of SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals. We find a high response against endemic coronaviruses in our sample set, but no consistent cross-reactive IgG response patterns against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show a robust, high-content-enabled, antigen-saving multiplex assay suited to both monitoring vaccination studies and facilitating epidemiologic screenings for humoral immunity towards pandemic and endemic coronaviruses."
