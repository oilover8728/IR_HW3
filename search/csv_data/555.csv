5541,Pre-procedural antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the routine endoscopic practice.,"Methods: a retrospective multicenter cohort study was performed of all endoscopic procedures performed between April 27 and June 15, 2020. A screening questionnaire (SQ) was performed with patients three days prior to the procedure and 14 days after. Furthermore, a serologic SARS-CoV-2 test was performed 48 hours before. Results: two hundred and eleven consecutive patients with endoscopic procedures were included. No patients had a positive SQ, either on entry to the study or 14 days later. Only four patients (1.9 % [95 % CI: 0.07-4.8 %]) were positive for antibodies. Conclusion: the pre-endoscopy seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is low in this cohort. Pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing does not add any benefit over clinical SQ to identify active COVID-19 patients."
5542,Provider Antibody Serology Study of Virus in the Emergency Room (PASSOVER) Study: Special Population COVID-19 Seroprevalence.,"Introduction: Limited data on the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among healthcare workers (HCW) are publicly available. In this study we sought to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a population of HCWs in a pediatric emergency department (ED). Methods: We conducted this observational cohort study from April 14-May 13, 2020 in a pediatric ED in Orange County, CA. Asymptomatic HCW ≥18 years of age were included in the study. Blood samples were obtained by fingerstick at the start of each shift. The inter-sampling interval was ≤96 hours. The primary outcome was positive seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 as determined with an antibody fast detection kit (Colloidal Gold, Superbio, Timisoara, Romania) for the SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G (IgM/IgG) antibody. Results: A total of 143 HCWs participated in the study. Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 10.5% (n = 15). Positive seroprevalence was classified as IgG only (4.9%), IgM+IgG (3.5%), or IgM only (2.1%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR in 0.7% of the overall study population (n = 1). Samples obtained on Day 1 indicated seropositivity in 4.2% of the study population (n = 6). Subsequent seroconversion occurred in 6.3% of participants (n = 9). The rate of seroconversion was linear with a rate of approximately one new case every two days, starting at Day 9 of the study. Conclusion: We observed a linear rate of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2-positive status among asymptomatic HCWs who underwent daily symptom surveys and temperature screens in an environment with universal source control. Rapid antibody testing may be useful for screening for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in high-risk populations, such as HCWs in the ED."
5543,Antibody response and the clinical presentation of patients with COVID-19 in Croatia: the importance of a two-step testing approach.,"According to anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroresponse in patients with COVID-19 from Croatia, we emphasised the issue of different serological tests and need for combining diagnostic methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG ELISA and IgM/IgG immunochromatographic assay (ICA) were used for testing 60 sera from 21 patients (6 with severe, 10 moderate, and 5 with mild disease). The main clinical, demographic, and haemato-biochemical data were analysed. The most common symptoms were cough (95.2%), fever (90.5%), and fatigue and shortness of breath (42.9%). Pulmonary opacities showed 76.2% of patients. Within the first 7 days of illness, seropositivity for ELISA IgA and IgG was 42.9% and 7.1%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 25% and 10.7%, respectively. From day 8 after onset, ELISA IgA and IgG seropositivity was 90.6% and 68.8%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 84.4% and 75%, respectively. In general, sensitivity for ELISA IgA and IgG was 68.3% and 40%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 56.7% and 45.0%, respectively. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody distributions by each method were statistically different (ICA IgM vs. IgG, p = 0.016; ELISA IgG vs. IgA, p < 0.001). Antibody response in COVID-19 varies and depends on the time the serum is taken, on the severity of disease, and on the type of test used. IgM and IgA antibodies as early-stage disease markers are comparable, although they cannot replace each other. Simultaneous IgM/IgG/IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing followed by the confirmation of positive findings with another test in a two-tier testing is recommended."
5544,Real-world evaluation of COVID-19 lateral flow device (LFD) mass-testing in healthcare workers at a London hospital; a prospective cohort analysis.,"Objectives: Real-world evaluation of the performance of the Innova lateral flow immunoassay antigen device (LFD) for regular COVID-19 testing of hospital workers. Methods: This prospective cohort analysis took place at a London NHS Trust. 5076 secondary care healthcare staff participated in LFD testing from 18 November 2020 to21 January 2021. Staff members submitted results and symptoms via an online portal twice weekly. Individuals with positive LFD results were invited for confirmatory SARS CoV-2 PCR testing. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the LFD was measured. Secondary outcome measures included time from LFD result to PCR test and staff symptom profiles. Results: 284/5076 individuals reported a valid positive LFD result, and a paired PCR result was obtained in 259/284 (91.2%). 244 were PCR positive yielding a PPV of 94.21% (244/259, 95% CI 90.73% to 96.43%). 204/259 (78.8%) staff members had the PCR within 36 hours of the LFD test. Symptom profiles were confirmed for 132/244 staff members (54.1%) with positive PCR results (true positives) and 13/15 (86.6%) with negative PCR results (false positives). 91/132 true positives (68.9%) were symptomatic at the time of LFD testing: 65/91 (71.4%) had symptoms meeting the PHE case definition of COVID-19, whilst 26/91 (28.6%) had atypical symptoms. 18/41 (43.9%) staff members who were asymptomatic at the time of positive LFD developed symptoms in the subsequent four days. 9/13 (76.9%) false positives were asymptomatic, 1/13 (7.7%) had atypical symptoms and 3/13 (23.1%) had symptoms matching the PHE case definition. Conclusions: The PPV of the Innova LFD is high when used amongst hospital staff during periods of high prevalence of COVID-19, yet we find frequent use by symptomatic staff rather than as a purely asymptomatic screening tool. LFD testing does allow earlier isolation of infected workers and facilitates detection of individuals whose symptoms do not qualify for PCR testing."
5545,Classification Models for COVID-19 Test Prioritization in Brazil: Machine Learning Approach.,"Background: Controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil is a challenge due to the population's size and urban density, inefficient maintenance of social distancing and testing strategies, and limited availability of testing resources. Objective: The purpose of this study is to effectively prioritize patients who are symptomatic for testing to assist early COVID-19 detection in Brazil, addressing problems related to inefficient testing and control strategies. Methods: Raw data from 55,676 Brazilians were preprocessed, and the chi-square test was used to confirm the relevance of the following features: gender, health professional, fever, sore throat, dyspnea, olfactory disorders, cough, coryza, taste disorders, and headache. Classification models were implemented relying on preprocessed data sets; supervised learning; and the algorithms multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting machine (GBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The models' performances were analyzed using 10-fold cross-validation, classification metrics, and the Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests. The permutation feature importance method was applied for ranking the features used by the classification models with the highest performances. Results: Gender, fever, and dyspnea were among the highest-ranked features used by the classification models. The comparative analysis presents MLP, GBM, DT, RF, XGBoost, and SVM as the highest performance models with similar results. KNN and LR were outperformed by the other algorithms. Applying the easy interpretability as an additional comparison criterion, the DT was considered the most suitable model. Conclusions: The DT classification model can effectively (with a mean accuracy≥89.12%) assist COVID-19 test prioritization in Brazil. The model can be applied to recommend the prioritizing of a patient who is symptomatic for COVID-19 testing."
5546,The impact of COVID-19 on allied health professions.,"The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) on allied health professionals work environment, access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 testing, and mental health. A 34-question survey was developed and distributed electronically to allied health professionals through listservs of professional organizations and social media groups. A total of 921 responses from allied health professionals in a variety of work settings were analyzed. The majority of allied health professionals had access to medical-grade PPE and agreed with their clinics decisions to stay open or closed. Private practices appeared to be the most negatively impacted with regards to employment in the form of pay reductions, furloughs, lay-offs, or the requirement of using paid time off. Importantly, 86% of all respondents, irrespective of employment status, reported feeling stressed with regards to changes in their work environment and transmission of the virus. However, levels of stress were dependent upon access to PPE and mental health resources. Specifically, those with access to mental health support reported lower stress levels than those without such access. These results highlight the need for continuous monitoring of mental health for allied health professionals in order to inform clinic and hospital policies for PPE and the development of brief interventions to mitigate adverse long-term mental health outcomes."

5548,SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors after the first COVID-19 wave in Canada.,"Background: Case detection underestimates the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the first COVID-19 wave, we estimated the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors across Canada. Study design and methods: This serial cross-sectional study was conducted between May 9 and July 21, 2020 from blood donors donating at all Canadian Blood Services locations. We used the Abbott Architect assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from retention plasma. Seroprevalence was standardized to population-level demographics and assay characteristics were adjusted using the Rogan-Gladen equation. Results were stratified by region, age, ethnicity, ABO groups, and quantiles of material and social deprivation indices. Temporal trends were evaluated at 2-week intervals. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression compared SARS-CoV-2 reactive to non-reactive donors by sociodemographic variables. Results: Overall 552/74642 donors, had detectable antibodies, adjusted seroprevalence was 7.0/1000 donors (95% CI; 6.3, 7.6). Prevalence was differential by geography, Ontario had the highest rate, 8.8/1000 donors (7.8, 9.8), compared to the Atlantic region 4.5/1000 donors (2.6, 6.4); adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.2 (1.5, 3.3). Donors that self-identified as an ethnic minority were more likely than white donors to be sero-reactive aOR 1.5 (1.2, 1.9). No temporal trends were observed. Discussion: Worldwide, blood services have leveraged their operational capacity to inform public health. While >99% of Canadians did not show humoral evidence of past infection, we found regional variability and disparities by ethnicity. Seroprevalence studies will continue to play a pivotal role in evaluating public health policies by identifying trends and monitor disparities."
5549,"Prevalence and factors associated with covid-19 vaccine hesitancy in Maranhao, Brazil.","Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and factors associated with hesitancy in getting the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Maranhão, Brazil. Methods: This is a cross-sectional population-based study conducted from October 19 to 30, 2020. The estimates were calculated based on clustering, stratification, and non-response. A three-stage sampling was adopted, considering stratum, census tracts, and domicile. After systematic analysis, thirty sectors were selected in each stratum, totaling 150 sectors. Each sector contained a fixed number of 34 households, thus totaling 5,100 households. One individual within each household (resident for at least six months and aged one year or more) was selected by a simple random sampling. We questioned participants about their vaccination intention. Univariate association between independent variables and the outcome were verified using descriptive analysis (weighted frequencies) and Pearson's chi-square test (p < 0.05). Robust multivariate analysis was performed using a three-level hierarchical model. Results: We found 17.5% (95%CI 16.1-19.1%) of the 4,630 individuals interviewed to report hesitancy to be vaccinated against covid-19. After final model adjustment, vaccination hesitancy was statistically higher among residents of the cities of Imperatriz (24.0%; RP = 1.48; IC95% 1.09-2.02) and municipalities of the Grande Ilha de São Luís (20.7%; RP = 1.34; 95%CI 1.02-1.76), female individuals (19.8%; RP = 1.44; 95%CI 1.20-1.75), older adults (22.8%; RP = 1.79; IC95% 1.30-2.46), evangelicals (24.1%; RP = 1.49; 95%CI 1.24-1.79), and those without reported symptoms (18.6%; RP = 1.24; 95%CI 1.02-1.51). We found no statistical differences for other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, as well as variables related to the labor market, behaviors, and health conditions of the interviewees. Conclusion: The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in Maranhão and its association with individual, contextual, and clinical factors enable us to identify the groups and contexts of greatest resistance, requiring special attention from public strategies to ensure wide vaccination."
