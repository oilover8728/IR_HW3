1150,A novel competition ELISA for the rapid quantification of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma.,"Background: COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) ideally contains high titers of (neutralizing) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Several scalable immunoassays for CCP selection have been developed. We designed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that measures neutralizing antibodies (of all isotypes) in plasma by determining the level of competition between CCP and a mouse neutralizing antibody for binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Plasma was collected from 72 convalescent individuals and inhibition of viral infection was determined by plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT50). The level of neutralizing antibodies was measured in the novel competition ELISA and in a commercially available ELISA that measures inhibition of recombinant ACE2 binding to immobilized RBD. These results were compared with a high throughput chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). Results: The results from both ELISAs were correlating, in particular for high titer CCP (PRNT50 ≥ 1:160) (Spearman r = .73, p < .001). Moderate correlation was found between the competition ELISA and CMIA (r = .57 for high titer and r = .62 for low titer CCP, p < .001). Receiver operator characteristic analysis showed that the competition ELISA selected CCP with a sensitivity and specificity of 61% and 100%, respectively. However, discrimination between low and high titer CCP had a lower resolution (sensitivity: 34% and specificity: 89%). Conclusion: The competition ELISA screens for neutralizing antibodies in CCP by competition for just a single epitope. It exerts a sensitivity of 61% with no false identifications. These ELISA designs can be used for epitope mapping or for selection of CCP."
1151,Delayed RT-PCR Time-To-Positivity in an adult with SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Early diagnosis is among the crucial measures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, but various factors can affect its performance leading to false negative results. Hereby we present a patient with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and had multiple negative RT-PCR results over 5 days. A 22-year-old woman presented with fever, dry cough, nausea, myalgia, headache, and mild dyspnea. Eleven days before, she was in close contact with her father who had tested positive for COVID-19. RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were performed on day 8, 9, and 12 of illness which all came back negative even after she started having a worsening dyspnea and showing an increased lung opacity from radiographic findings on day 11 of illness. Interestingly, her rapid antibody test (VivaDiag™ COVID-19 IgM/IgG rapid test by VivaChek Biotech (HangZhou,China) was positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig M and Ig G. Due to the worsening condition, she was referred to a tertiary hospital where her RT PCR result was positive on day 13 of illness. After 28 days from her first symptom, she was discharged from the hospital with improved symptoms and chest X-ray. As conclusions, in patients with high suspicion of COVID-19, repeat swab tests are mandatory if previous tests were negative. The diagnosis and treatment plan of COVID-19 should not solely be based on RT-PCR, but also consider the patient's history, symptoms, laboratory result, and radiographic findings."
1152,[Key Points for Quality Control of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Testing Kits].,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the accurate and rapid clinical diagnosis technology of SARS-CoV-2 has played a crucial role in the prevention and control of epidemic situation. This study aims to analyze and discuss the key points for quality control of 2019 novel coronavirus testing kits, while incorporating the actual testing process, the distribution of testing kits and interpretation of relevant policies and regulations."
1153,Four Cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Transferred from a Cruise Ship.,"An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that began in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly to many countries. We herein report four cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Japan among passengers of the cruise ship Diamond Princess and describe the clinical features, clinical course, and progression of chest computed tomographic images, chest radiographs, and treatment. Although these four patients had symptoms that included a fever, malaise, runny nose, and cough, one patient had no symptoms on admission. Two of the four patients needed mechanical ventilation due to respiratory deterioration. One of the patients who required mechanical ventilation was transferred to a higher-level medical institution. Except for that patient, the other three patients were able to return home under their own power. Every patient took lopinavir/ritonavir, which was considered the most effective treatment at the time. We used it after receiving approval from the ethics committee in our hospital. In this case report, we emphasize that some patients need to be carefully monitored, even if their respiratory condition is stable at the initial presentation, as their respiratory status may deteriorate rapidly within a few days after oxygen administration begins."

1155,Evaluation of RNA Extraction-Free Method for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Salivary Samples for Mass Screening for COVID-19.,"In this COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dire need for cost-effective and less time-consuming alternatives for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The RNA extraction-free method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva is a promising option. This study found that it has high sensitivity (85.34%), specificity (95.04%), and was comparable to the gold standard nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) sample tests. The method showed good agreement between salivary and NPS samples, with a kappa coefficient of 0.797. However, there are variations in the sensitivity and specificity based on the RT-PCR kit used. The Thermo Fisher Applied Biosystems showed high sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) but also showed a higher percentage of invalid reports. On the other hand, the BGI kit showed high specificity, better agreement (kappa coefficient) between the results of saliva and NPS samples, and higher correlation between the Ct values of saliva and NPS samples. Thus, the RNA extraction-free method for salivary sample serves as an effective alternative screening method for COVID-19."

1157,Factors associated with viral clearance periods from patients with COVID-19: A retrospective observational cohort study.,"Introduction: Knowledge is limited on the virologic course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, particularly the time taken for viral clearance and the optimal time to discontinue isolation. This study aims to identify the clinical and demographic factors influencing the time taken for viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 to determine the optimal isolation period. Methods: This two-center retrospective observational cohort study was conducted between March 1 and June 31, 2020. Patients with COVID-19, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, were included. Data were extracted from medical records. The positive duration, which was defined as the period from the day of symptom onset to the negative conversion day, was assessed using a generalized linear model. Results: We included 63 patients. The mean positive duration was 20 days. The positive duration was significantly shorter for patients younger than 30 years of age and those between 30 and 60 years of age than for patients older than 60 years of age. We observed a more scattered distribution of the positive duration in older patients than in younger patients. Conclusions: Younger patients who recovered from COVID-19 took less time to clear SARS-CoV-2 than older patients; thus, a classification of the isolation periods based on age could be considered. A uniform viral clearance period for older patients may be difficult to determine because of biases such as underlying medical conditions. Further surveillance measures are recommended to determine the viral clearance time and the optimal isolation period."

1159,Prediction of False-Positive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Molecular Results in a High-Throughput Open-Platform System.,"Widespread high-throughput testing for identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by RT-PCR has been a foundation in the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Quality assurance metrics for these RT-PCR tests are still evolving as testing is widely implemented. As testing increases, it is important to understand performance characteristics and the errors associated with these tests. Herein, we investigate a high-throughput, laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay to determine whether modeling can generate quality control metrics that identify false-positive (FP) results due to contamination. This study reviewed repeated clinical samples focusing on positive samples that test negative on re-extraction and PCR, likely representing false positives. To identify and predict false-positive samples, we constructed machine learning-derived models based on the extraction method used. These models identified variables associated with false-positive results across all methods, with sensitivities for predicting FP results ranging between 67% and 100%. Application of the models to all results predicted a total FP rate of 0.08% across all samples, or 2.3% of positive results, similar to reports for other RT-PCR tests for RNA viruses. These models can predict quality control parameters, enabling laboratories to generate decision trees that reduce interpretation errors, allow for automated reflex testing of samples with a high FP probability, improve workflow efficiency, and increase diagnostic accuracy for patient care."
