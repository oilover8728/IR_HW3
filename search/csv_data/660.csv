6590,Kidney involvement in COVID-19 and its treatments.,"The lungs are the most commonly affected organ by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the kidneys are also frequently affected. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can not only cause new kidney damage but also increase the difficulty of treatment and care as well as mortality for people with underlying kidney diseases. Kidney involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly manifests as kidney tubular injury. Proteinuria is the main clinical sign. To reduce patient mortality, kidney complications should be given increased attention in the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study reviews the existing literature and discusses COVID-19 infection in combination with kidney diseases in terms of kidney damage, pathogenesis, and treatment to guide clinical anti-epidemic responses."
6591,Willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials; a survey among a population of healthcare workers in Uganda.,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and may therefore be a suitable population for COVID-19 vaccine trials. We conducted a survey to evaluate willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials in a population of HCWs at three hospitals in Uganda. Methods: The survey was conducted between September and November 2020. Using a standardised questionnaire, data were collected on socio-demographics, previous participation in health research, COVID-19 information sources, underlying health conditions, and willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Data were analysed descriptively and a binomial generalised linear model with a log link function used to investigate factors associated with unwillingness to participate. Results: 657 HCWs (female, 63%) were enrolled with a mean age of 33 years (Standard Deviation, 10). Overall willingness-to-participate was 70.2%. Key motivating factors for participation were: hope of being protected against COVID-19 (81.1%), altruism (73.3%), and the opportunity to get health care (26.0%). Selected hypothetical trial attributes reduced willingness-to-participate as follows: weekly-quarterly study visits over a 12-month period (70.2%-63.2%, P = 0.026); provision of approximately 50ml of blood at each study visit (70.2%-63.2%, P = 0.026); risk of mild-moderate local adverse reactions (70.2%-60.3%, P<0.001); chance of receiving candidate vaccine or placebo (70.2%-56.9%, P<0.001); and delay of pregnancy [Overall, 70.2%-57.1% P<0.001); Female, 62.8%-48.4% (P = 0.002); Male, 82.5%-71.5% (P = 0.003)]. Collectively, these attributes reduced willingness-to-participate from [70.2%-42.2% (P<0.001) overall; 82.5%-58.1% (P<0.001) in men; 62.8%-32.6% (P<0.001) in women]. Among individuals that were unwilling to participate, the commonest barriers were concerns over vaccine safety (54.6%) and fear of catching SARS-CoV-2 (31.6%). Unwillingness to participate was associated with being female (aRR 1.97, CI 1.46-2.67, P<0.001) and having university or other higher-level education (aRR 1.52, CI 1.05-2.2, P = 0.026). Conclusions: Willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials among HCWs in Uganda is high but may be affected by vaccine trial requirements and concerns about the safety of candidate vaccines."

6593,SARS-CoV-2 host diversity: An update of natural infections and experimental evidence.,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a pandemic threat. This virus is supposed to be spread by human to human transmission. Cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 which is identical or similar in different species of animals such as pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, monkeys, and humans. Moreover, a recent study predicted that dogs might be secondary hosts during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bat to human. Therefore, there is a possibility of spreading SARS-CoV-2 through domestic pets. There are now many reports of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in dogs, cats, tigers, lion, and minks. Experimental data showed ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as infected by virus inoculation and can transmit the virus directly or indirectly by droplets or airborne routes. Based on these natural infection reports and experimental data, whether the pets are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 spread to humans; needs to be deeply investigated. Humans showing clinical symptoms of respiratory infections have been undergoing for the COVID-19 diagnostic test but many infected people and few pets confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic. In this review, we summarize the natural cases of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with the latest researches conducted in this field. This review will be helpful to think insights of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions, spread, and demand for seroprevalence studies, especially in companion animals."

6595,The Potentially Recommended Pharmacotherapy for COVID-19.,"Context: A completely unique coronavirus (2019-nCoV), formally referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), appeared in China. SARS-CoV-2 is an etiological mediator of coronavirus 2 (COVID-19), characterized by pneumonic contagion in human beings. In spite of forceful suppression, this virus has spread worldwide. No specific drugs have been approved by the FDA for treating COVID-19 patients. Objective: The study intended to examine the data from studies on clinical management of COVID-19. Design: The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. The sources of data included bioRxiv, medRxiv, Google Scholar, Embase, PsychINFO, WanFang Data, and PubMed. The search terms were treatment of the novel coronavirus, management of nCoV-19, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. Setting: The study took place in the main library of the University of Sargodha in Sargodha, Pakistan. Results: The study identified 42 unique studies that had reported and confirmed over 1500 cases of nCoV-19 by April 21, 2020. The studies found that clinical management, for patients who presented with symptoms, included supportive care and control measures that comprised mechanical ventilator support and supplementary oxygen. Conclusions: There have been intensive attempts to explore drug therapy for the prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection during this COVID-19 pandemic. Several drugs have been identified which including remdesivir, two antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and immunosuppressive agents. The effects of most drug interventions are currently highly uncertain and several drugs and vaccines are under trail for the effective treatment of COVID-19 virus, until an effective treatment will discover social distancing and physical hygiene should be practiced strictly."

6597,2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak: SOS Alert for Dentists.,"On January 31, 2020, novel coronavirus (nCoV), a zoonotic virus yet to be identified into the taxonomy, created a powerful ripple through mankind that the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency.1 This is definitely not the first time that an alarm has been rung by this family of viruses. Epidemic impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to SARS CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) by MERS CoV has engraved their place in the scientific literature.2 In general, CoV is known to cause respiratory diseases in humans and accounts for one-third of common cold infections.3 The current outbreak by 2019 nCoV in the Chinese city of Wuhan began in December 2019, has infected nearly 102,188 with 3,491 deaths reported as of March 7, 2020, and has spread to nearly 92 countries.1,4 An assumed incubation period between 2 and 14 days, with flu-like symptoms, may progress into severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome which may be the reason for mortality.5,6."
6598,First report of a de novo iTTP episode associated with an mRNA-based anti-COVID-19 vaccination.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but potentially life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy, characterized by disseminated thrombus formation in the microvasculature, causing severe organ failure. Immune-mediated TTP (iTTP) is occasionally described after vaccination, especially against viral agents. We report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a de novo iTTP after exposure to the mRNA-based anti-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine produced by Pfizer-BioNTech. She presented with increased bruising and petechiae starting 2 weeks after receiving the first dose of the anti-COVID-19 vaccine. Laboratory data revealed a severe ADAMTS13-deficiency in combination with a very high autoantibody titer against ADAMTS13. She was successfully treated with plasma exchange, corticosteroids, rituximab, and caplacizumab. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of iTTP after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination in a previously TTP-naÃ¯ve patient."
6599,[Legal resposability of vaccinating doctor].,"The legal responsibility of the vaccinating doctor is one of the central issues in the current setting of the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim of this statement is to outline the profiles of the medical legal liability, with a focus on the figure of the vaccinating physician, in criminal, civil, and disciplinary terms, based on the Italian legislation in force. The vaccinating doctor responds for his work in the field of vaccination in the same way as any other health service should perform (diagnostic, therapeutic, etc.). Helpful in this context is the adoption of the L. 76/2021; it was developed to find a balance between safeguarding the person privacy and greater guarantees for the doctor. This law introduces a criminal shield that can put a limit to litigation, curbing the phenomenon of so-called defensive medicine. The climate of uncertainty and fear of legal repercussions for the doctors, and the constant updating and redefinition of the indications of operability in the vaccination campaigns, underline the need to focus on the knowledge of the responsibilities and the safeguard of the vaccinating doctors. In addition to the regulatory cornerstones, the statement also addresses the issue of informed consent and the role of the occupational doctor as a central figure in the vaccination campaign in the workplace."
