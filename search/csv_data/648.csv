6471,Willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine with and without emergency use authorization.,"Background: This study assessed psychosocial predictors of U.S. adults' willingness to get a future COVID-19 vaccine and whether these predictors differ under an emergency use authorization (EUA) release of the vaccine. Methods: A survey of 788 U.S. adults was conducted to explore the relationships between demographics and psychosocial predictors of intent to get a future COVID-19 vaccine as well as willingness to get such a vaccine under EUA. Results: Significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions were education, having insurance, scoring high on subjective norms, a positive attitude toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, scoring low on barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy. Predictors of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA were age, race/ethnicity, positive subjective norms, high perceived behavioral control, positive attitudes toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, low barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy for getting the vaccine. Concerns about rushed vaccine development appear to reduce vaccine uptake intent, as well as willingness to get the vaccine under EUA. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine-related messages should both address concerns about the vaccine and its development and reinforce benefits of the vaccine (both factors significant in both models). Vaccine efforts may need to go beyond just communications campaigns correcting misinformation about a COVID-19 vaccine to also focus on re-establishing public trust in government agencies."
6472,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal specimens without extraction of viral RNA.,"To circumvent the limited availability of RNA extraction reagents, we aimed to develop a protocol for direct RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs without RNA extraction. Nasopharyngeal specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses collected in universal viral transport (UVT) medium were pre-processed by several commercial and laboratory-developed methods and tested by RT-qPCR assays without RNA extraction using different RT-qPCR master mixes. The results were compared to that of standard approach that involves RNA extraction. Incubation of specimens at 65°C for 10 minutes along with the use of TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix provides higher analytical sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than many other conditions tested. The optimized direct RT-qPCR approach demonstrated a limit of detection of 6.6x103 copy/ml and high reproducibility (co-efficient of variation = 1.2%). In 132 nasopharyngeal specimens submitted for SARS-CoV-2 testing, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our optimized approach were 95%, 99% and 98.5%, respectively, with reference to the standard approach. Also, the RT-qPCR CT values obtained by the two methods were positively correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.6971, p = 0.0013). The rate of PCR inhibition by the direct approach was 8% compared to 9% by the standard approach. Our simple approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR may help laboratories continue testing for the virus despite reagent shortages or expand their testing capacity in resource limited settings."

6474,To Be or Not To Be Vaccinated: That Is a Question in Myasthenia Gravis.,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness and abnormal fatigability due to the antibodies against postsynaptic receptors. Despite the individual discrepancy, patients with MG share common muscle weakness, autoimmune dysfunction, and immunosuppressive treatment, which predispose them to infections that can trigger or exacerbate MG. Vaccination, as a mainstay of prophylaxis, is a major management strategy. However, the past years have seen growth in vaccine hesitancy, owing to safety and efficacy concerns. Ironically, vaccines, serving as an essential and effective means of defense, may induce similar immune cross-reactivity to what they are meant to prevent. Herein, we outline the progress in vaccination, review the current status, and postulate the clinical association among MG, vaccination, and immunosuppression. We also address safety and efficacy concerns of vaccination in MG, in relation to COVID-19. Since only a handful of studies have reported vaccination in individuals with MG, we further review the current clinical studies and guidelines in rheumatic diseases. Overall, our reviews offer a reference to guide future vaccine clinical decision-making and improve the management of MG patients."
6475,SARS-CoV-2: Insights into its structural intricacies and functional aspects for drug and vaccine development.,"Globally, SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as threat to life and economy. Researchers are trying to find a cure against this pathogen but without much success. Several attempts have been made to understand the atomic level details of SARS-CoV-2 in the past few months. However, one review with all structural details for drug and vaccine development has been missing. Hence, this review aims to summarize key functional roles played by various domains of SARS-CoV-2 genome during its entry into the host, replication, repression of host immune response and overall viral life cycle. Additionally, various proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for finding a potent inhibitor have also been highlighted. To mitigate this deadly virus, an understanding of atomic level information, pathogenicity mechanisms and functions of different proteins in causing the infection is imperative. Thus, these structural details would finally pave the way for development of a potential drug/vaccine against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2."

6477,Novel Small-Molecule Scaffolds as Candidates against the SARS Coronavirus 2 Main Protease: A Fragment-Guided in Silico Approach.,"The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has been the greatest global health crisis since the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. Thus far, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 1 million deaths, and there is no cure or vaccine to date. The recently solved crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease has been a major focus for drug-discovery efforts. Here, we present a fragment-guided approach using ZINCPharmer, where 17 active fragments known to bind to the catalytic centre of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) were used as pharmacophore queries to search the ZINC databases of natural compounds and natural derivatives. This search yielded 134 hits that were then subjected to multiple rounds of in silico analyses, including blind and focused docking against the 3D structure of the main protease. We scrutinised the poses, scores, and protein-ligand interactions of 15 hits and selected 7. The scaffolds of the seven hits were structurally distinct from known inhibitor scaffolds, thus indicating scaffold novelty. Our work presents several novel scaffolds as potential candidates for experimental validation against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro."
6478,Universal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) Testing Uptake in the Labor and Delivery Unit: Implications for Health Equity.,"Objective: To understand severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing uptake in the labor and delivery unit and rationales for declining testing, and to institute a process to increase equitable testing uptake. Methods: We conducted a quality-improvement initiative from May 28-June 25, 2020, during the first 4 weeks of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in the Barnes-Jewish Hospital labor and delivery unit. All consecutive patients presenting for delivery without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms were offered testing over four 1-week phases. Phase I documented the rate of testing uptake. Phase II recorded patients' reasons for declining testing. Phase III used phase II findings to create and implement shared decision-making tools. Phase IV offered each patient who declined nasopharyngeal testing an oropharyngeal alternative. The primary outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake by phase. Results: Of 270 patients, 223 (83%) accepted testing and 47 (17%) declined. Maternal age and mode of delivery were similar between groups, whereas testing uptake was higher among nulliparous, White, Hispanic, or privately insured patients. There was a significant increase in the primary outcome of SARS-CoV-2 testing across phases I-IV, from 68% to 76% to 94% to 95%, respectively (Somers' D 0.45; 95% CI of association 0.30-0.59). The most commonly cited reason for declining testing was concern regarding testing discomfort. In subgroup analyses by race and insurance type, there was a significant increase in testing uptake across phases I-IV for Black patients (56%, 54%, 91%, 92%; Somers' D 0.36; 95% CI of association 0.28-0.64), White patients (76%, 93%, 96%, 100%; Somers' D 0.59; 95% CI of association 0.38-0.8), those with Medicaid insurance (60%, 64%, 88%, 92%; 95%; Somers' D 0.39; CI of association 0.22 to 0.56), and those with private insurance (77%, 96%, 97%, 100%; Somers' D 0.63; 95% CI of association 0.40-0.86). Conclusion: Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake significantly increased through a rapid-cycle improvement initiative. Aligning hospital policy with patient-centered approaches led to nearly universally acceptable testing."
6479,Methylene blue inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. Currently there is no antiviral treatment recommended against SARS-CoV-2. Identifying effective antiviral drugs is urgently required. Methylene blue has already demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity in photodynamic therapy as well as antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic activities in non-photodynamic assays. In this study. non-photoactivated methylene blue showed in vitro activity at very low micromolar range with an EC50 (median effective concentration) of 0.30 ± 0.03 μM and an EC90 (90% effective concentration) of 0.75 ± 0.21 μM at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.25 against SARS-CoV-2 (strain IHUMI-3). The EC50 and EC90 values for methylene blue are lower than those obtained for hydroxychloroquine (1.5 μM and 3.0 μM) and azithromycin (20.1 μM and 41.9 μM). The ratios Cmax/EC50 and Cmax/EC90 in blood for methylene blue were estimated at 10.1 and 4.0, respectively, following oral administration and 33.3 and 13.3 following intravenous administration. Methylene blue EC50 and EC90 values are consistent with concentrations observed in human blood. We propose that methylene blue is a promising drug for treatment of COVID-19. In vivo evaluation in animal experimental models is now required to confirm its antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2. The potential interest of methylene blue to treat COVID-19 needs to be confirmed by prospective comparative clinical studies."
