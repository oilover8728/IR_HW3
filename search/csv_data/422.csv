4211,Lessons from the team care playbook: Recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination dissemination and uptake.,"For too many of us, the implications of a worldwide pandemic unfolded in graduated stages of understanding that seemed too sluggish for the opponent we faced. For too many of us, even those of us in health care, the unfolding was terrifying; we felt blindsided and unprepared. If coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were a bully picking a fight, they got the first punch in before we even raised a fist. Now, many rounds in, health care teams will have an opportunity to deploy a new weapon against COVID-19. Vaccines are coming. We do not know when, who will pay for them, or the logistical aspects (e.g., storage and administration). We do not even know how effective they will be. Moreover, we must plan for mass vaccination in a chaotic and politically charged context that bears little resemblance to the ones with which we have experience. Nevertheless, in this fight, vaccines could be our winning blow. We are getting better at working with unknowns and in disrupted environments during COVID-19. We have some time to prepare, and we have some extant knowledge and experience in vaccine distribution and uptake. Health care teams can use these to best their adversary, and we can and should begin now. The aim of this article is to discuss how to mobilize interprofessional teams within systems of care to engage best practices in vaccine dissemination and uptake in the unique COVID-19 context. We begin by discussing challenges to dissemination and uptake and then provide solutions using our experiences in the primary care system.

4213,Does reactogenicity after a second injection of the BNT162b2 vaccine predict spike IgG antibody levels in healthy Japanese subjects?,"Background: Adverse reactions are more common after the second injection of messenger RNA vaccines such as Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2. We hypothesized that the degree and severity of reactogenicity after the second injection reflects the magnitude of antibody production against the SARS CoV-2 virus spike protein (spike IgG). Methods and results: Blood samples were obtained from 67 Japanese healthcare workers three weeks after the first injection and two weeks after the second injection of the BNT162b2 vaccine to measure spike IgG levels. Using questionnaires, we calculated an adverse event (AE) score (0-11) for each participant. The geometric mean of spike IgG titers increased from 1,047 antibody units (AU/mL) (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 855-1282 AU/mL) after the first injection to 17,378 AU/mL (95% CI: 14,622-20,663 AU/mL) after the second injection. The median AE score increased from 2 to 5. Spike IgG levels after the second injection were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with spike IgG after the first injection. AE scores after the second injection were not significantly associated with log-transformed spike IgG after the second injection, when adjusted for age, sex, AE score after the first injection, and log-transformed spike IgG after the first injection. Conclusions: Although the sample size was relatively small, reactogenicity after the second injection may not accurately reflect antibody production."
4214,Acceptable performance of the Abbott ID NOW among symptomatic individuals with confirmed COVID-19.,"Introduction. The ID NOW is FDA approved for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals within the first 7 days of symptom onset for COVID-19 if tested within 1 h of specimen collection.Gap statement. Clinical data on the performance of the ID NOW are limited, with many studies varying in their study design and/or having small sample size.Aim. In this study we aimed to determine the clinical performance of the ID NOW compared to conventional RT-PCR testing.Methodology. Adults with COVID-19 in the community or hospital were recruited into the study. Paired throat swabs were collected, with one throat swab transported immediately in an empty sterile tube to the laboratory for ID NOW testing, and the other transported in universal transport media and tested by an in-house SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay targeting the E gene.Results. In total, 133 individuals were included in the study; 129 samples were positive on either the ID NOW and/or RT-PCR. Assuming any positive result on either assay represents a true positive, positive per cent agreement (PPA) of the ID NOW compared to RT-PCR with 95 % confidence intervals was 89.1 % (82.0-94.1%) and 91.6 % (85.1-95.9%), respectively. When analysing individuals with symptom duration â‰¤7 days and who had the ID NOW performed within 1 h (n=62), ID NOW PPA increased to 98.2 %.Conclusion. Results from the ID NOW were reliable, especially when adhering to the manufacturer's recommendations for testing."
4215,"Performance of Saliva, Oropharyngeal Swabs, and Nasal Swabs for SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are considered the highest-yield sample for diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The need to increase capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a variety of settings, combined with shortages of sample collection supplies, have motivated a search for alternative sample types with high sensitivity. We systematically reviewed the literature to understand the performance of alternative sample types compared to NP swabs. We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval 1 October 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types (saliva, oropharyngeal [OP], and nasal [NS] swabs) versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). A logistic-normal random-effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate % positive alternative-specimen, % positive NP, and % dual positives overall and in subgroups. The QUADAS 2 tool was used to assess bias. From 1,253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting inclusion criteria. Three specimen types captured lower % positives (NS [82%, 95% CI: 73 to 90%], OP [84%, 95% CI: 57 to 100%], and saliva [88%, 95% CI: 81 to 93%]) than NP swabs, while combined OP/NS matched NP performance (97%, 95% CI: 90 to 100%). Absence of RNA extraction (saliva) and utilization of a more sensitive NAAT (NS) substantially decreased alternative-specimen yield of positive samples. NP swabs remain the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, although alternative specimens are promising. Much remains unknown about the impact of variations in specimen collection, processing protocols, and population (pediatric versus adult, late versus early in disease course), such that head-to head studies of sampling strategies are urgently needed."
4216,Vaccine Breakthrough Infections with SARS-CoV-2 Variants.,"Emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of clinical concern. In a cohort of 417 persons who had received the second dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine at least 2 weeks previously, we identified 2 women with vaccine breakthrough infection. Despite evidence of vaccine efficacy in both women, symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 developed, and they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase-chain-reaction testing. Viral sequencing revealed variants of likely clinical importance, including E484K in 1 woman and three mutations (T95I, del142-144, and D614G) in both. These observations indicate a potential risk of illness after successful vaccination and subsequent infection with variant virus, and they provide support for continued efforts to prevent and diagnose infection and to characterize variants in vaccinated persons.

4218,Modeling and computation of multistep batch testing for infectious diseases.,"We propose a mathematical model based on probability theory to optimize COVID-19 testing by a multistep batch testing approach with variable batch sizes. This model and simulation tool dramatically increase the efficiency and efficacy of the tests in a large population at a low cost, particularly when the infection rate is low. The proposed method combines statistical modeling with numerical methods to solve nonlinear equations and obtain optimal batch sizes at each step of tests, with the flexibility to incorporate geographic and demographic information. In theory, this method substantially improves the false positive rate and positive predictive value as well. We also conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to verify this theory. Our simulation results show that our method significantly reduces the false negative rate. More accurate assessment can be made if the dilution effect or other practical factors are taken into consideration. The proposed method will be particularly useful for the early detection of infectious diseases and prevention of future pandemics. The proposed work will have broader impacts on medical testing for contagious diseases in general."
4219,"Early Laboratory Preparedness of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency and Response to Unknown Pneumonia Outbreak from Wuhan, China, in January 2020.","We report the response process of the Laboratory Analysis Task Force (LATF) for Unknown Disease Outbreaks (UDOs) at the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) during January 2020 to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which developed as a UDO in Korea. The advanced preparedness offered by the laboratory diagnostic algorithm for UDOs related to respiratory syndromes was critical for the rapid identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and enabled us to establish and expand the diagnostic capacity for COVID-19 on a national scale in a timely manner."
