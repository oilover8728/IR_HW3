5840,COVID-19 Vaccination-Related Uptake on FDG PET/CT: An Emerging Dilemma and Suggestions for Management.,"As mass COVID-19 vaccination is underway, radiologists are encountering transient FDG uptake in normal or enlarged axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes after ipsilateral deltoid vaccination. This phenomenon may confound interpretation in patients with cancer undergoing FDG PET/CT. In this article, we present our institutional approach for management of COVID-19 vaccine-related lymphadenopathy on FDG PET/CT according to early experience. We suggest performing PET/CT at least 2 weeks after vaccination in patients with a cancer for which interpretation is anticipated to be potentially impacted by the vaccination but optimally 4-6 weeks after vaccination given increased immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines and potentially longer time for resolution than lymphadenopathy after other vaccines. PET/CT should not be delayed when clinically indicated to be performed sooner. Details regarding vaccination should be collected at the time of PET/CT to facilitate interpretation. Follow-up recommendations for postvaccination lymphadenopathy are provided, considering the lymph node's morphology and likely clinical relevance. Consideration should be given to administering the vaccine in the arm contralateral to a unilateral cancer to avoid confounding FDG uptake on the side of cancer. Our preliminary experience and suggested institutional approach should guide radiologists in management of patients with cancer undergoing PET/CT after COVID-19 vaccination."
5841,Polymerase Chain Reaction Assays Reverted to Positive in 25 Discharged Patients With COVID-19.,"We report the observation that 14.5% of COVID-19 patients had positive RT-PCR testing again after discharge. We describe correlations between laboratory parameters and treatment duration (P = .002) and time to virus recrudescence (P = .008), suggesting the need for additional measures to confirm illness resolution in COVID-19 patients."
5842,Attitudes and Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination Among Nurses and Midwives in Cyprus: A Cross-Sectional Survey.,"Healthcare workers are at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic and have been identified as a priority target group for COVID-19 vaccines. This study aimed to determine the COVID-19 vaccination intention among nurses and midwives in Cyprus and reveal the influential factors that affected their decision. An Internet-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between December 8 and 28, 2020. Data collection was accomplished using a self-administered questionnaire with questions about socio-demographic characteristics, questions assessing general vaccination-related intentions and behaviors, and the intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination. A sample of 437 responders answered the survey, with 93% being nurses and 7% midwives. A small proportion of the participants would accept a vaccine against COVID-19, while 70% could be qualified as ""vaccine hesitant."" The main reasons for not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine were concerns about the vaccine's expedited development and fear of side effects. More females, individuals with a larger median age, and a higher number of years of working experience, intended to accept the COVID-19 vaccination, compared with those not intended to accept and undecided groups (p < 0.01). Having a seasonal flu vaccination in the last 5 years, receiving the vaccines recommended for health professionals, and working in the private sector were associated with a higher probability of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance. A considerable rate of nurses and midwives in Cyprus reported unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine due to vaccine-related concerns. Our findings highlight the need for forthcoming vaccination campaigns and programs to tackle coronavirus vaccine hesitancy barriers to achieve the desirable vaccination coverage."
5843,Determinants of IgG antibodies kinetics after severe and critical COVID-19.,"The kinetics of IgG antibodies after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain poorly understood. We investigated factors influencing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibody levels and time to seronegativation during the follow-up of severe and critically ill patients. We retrospectively reviewed serological evaluations drawn during the follow-up of severe or critical laboratory-proven COVID-19 patients hospitalized at a large academic hospital. Specific IgG titers were measured using a chemiluminescent assay targeting anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG. The influence of time, demographic factors, clinical and paraclinical characteristics, and COVID-19 therapeutics on IgG levels were assessed through linear regression using a mixed-effect model, and delay until IgG negativation through a Weibull regression model. The cohort included 116 patients with a total of 154 IgG measurements drawn at a median of 79 days after diagnosis. IgG antibodies were increased with age (p = 0.005) and decreased significantly over time (p = 0.0002). Using elapsed time and age as covariates, we demonstrated higher IgG levels in patients with a higher body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.0026) and lower IgG levels in immunocompromised patients (p = 0.032). A high BMI was further found to delay and immunodeficiency to hasten significantly seronegativation, whereas no significant effect was observed with corticosteroids. These data highlight the waning over time of IgG antibodies after severe or critical COVID-19. Age, BMI, and immunosuppression also appear to influence the IgG kinetics, while short-term corticotherapy does not. Those data improve the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 serology while further research should determine the determinants of long-term seroprotection."
5844,"Rapid Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a State Prison After Introduction by Newly Transferred Incarcerated Persons - Wisconsin, August 14-October 22, 2020.","SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread rapidly in prisons and can be introduced by staff members and newly transferred incarcerated persons (1,2). On September 28, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) contacted CDC to report a COVID-19 outbreak in a state prison (prison A). During October 6-20, a CDC team investigated the outbreak, which began with 12 cases detected from specimens collected during August 17-24 from incarcerated persons housed within the same unit, 10 of whom were transferred together on August 13 and under quarantine following prison intake procedures (intake quarantine). Potentially exposed persons within the unit began a 14-day group quarantine on August 25. However, quarantine was not restarted after quarantined persons were potentially exposed to incarcerated persons with COVID-19 who were moved to the unit. During the subsequent 8 weeks (August 14-October 22), 869 (79.4%) of 1,095 incarcerated persons and 69 (22.6%) of 305 staff members at prison A received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens from 172 cases among incarcerated persons showed that all clustered in the same lineage; this finding, along with others, demonstrated that facility spread originated with the transferred cohort. To effectively implement a cohorted quarantine, which is a harm reduction strategy for correctional settings with limited space, CDC's interim guidance recommendation is to serial test cohorts, restarting the 14-day quarantine period when a new case is identified (3). Implementing more effective intake quarantine procedures and available mitigation measures, including vaccination, among incarcerated persons is important to controlling transmission in prisons. Understanding and addressing the challenges faced by correctional facilities to implement medical isolation and quarantine can help reduce and prevent outbreaks."
5845,Evaluation of Routine Blood Tests for Diagnosis of Suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"Background: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, it is not universally available and may have limitations in response times. The aim was to evaluate the routine blood tests for diagnosis of COVID-19, determining the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers to differentiate between patients with and without COVID-19. Methods: Clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays from adult patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (fever, cough and/or dyspnea) at hospital admission were reviewed. Patients were classified into two groups according to RT-PCR COVID-19: positive (COVID-19) or negative (NON-COVID-19). Diagnostic accuracy was determined by analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the cutoff value. In order to reduce the number of false positives, the cutoff value with a specificity of 80% was considered. Results: Two hundred three patients (101 females, 102 males) with ages between 18 and 96 years (mean = 61.3) were studied. Ninety-four were COVID-19 and 109 were NON-COVID-19. Plasma ferritin level was the most accurate biomarker (AUC = 0.847 and 0.804 in women and men, respectively). The following diagnostic criteria for suspected COVID-19 were established with biomarker cutoff values to differentiate between COVID-19 and NON-COVID-19 patients: lymphocytes ≤ 1.0 x 109/L; eosinophils ≤ 0.02 x 109/L; ferritin > 125% of upper reference limit (URL); LDH > 125% of URL; hsCRP > 80 mg/L; and D-dimer > 1.2 mg/L. Sensitivity was 66%, 64% 62%, 46%, 43%, and 33% for ferritin, eosinophils, LDH, hsCRP, lymphocytes, and D-dimer, respectively. Of those determined to be COVID-19 patients, 91% met one or more of the diagnostic criteria with these blood biomarkers, and of the NON-COVID-19 patients, 47% did not met any diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: Blood counts of lymphocytes and eosinophils, and plasma levels of D-dimer, LDH, hsCRP, and ferritin can be used to differentiate patients with and without COVID-19 and as a tool for diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in adult patients at hospital admission."
5846,Sociodemographic factors associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine and clinical trials in Uganda: a cross-sectional study in western Uganda.,"Background: Health experts agree that widespread use of safe and effective vaccines will rapidly contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The big question is whether these vaccines can easily be accepted by their end-users. Our study aimed at determining sociodemographic factors associated with acceptance of vaccines and clinical trials of COVID-19 in western Uganda. Method: A simplified snowball sampling technique was used to select 1067 respondents of 18-70 years in western Uganda using an online questionnaire from July to September 2020. Vaccine acceptability and risk perception were assessed using odds ratio at 95% confidence interval in R software version 3.6.3. Results: There were 1067 participants in the study. The majority were males (73.2%) and age group 31-40 years (32.6%). The acceptance rate for COVID-19 vaccination was (53.6%; 572/1067) with those aged 18-20 years, males, elites at tertiary level of education (degree or diploma), students, Muslims, married, non-salary earners and rural dwellers having better odds and likeliness to accept vaccination. Only 44.6% (476/1067) showed interest in clinical trials among which; males, primary school leavers, students, Christians, un-married, respondents who didn't earn any salary and rural dwellers had better odds and likelihood to participate in clinical trials. Conclusion: There was a low level of vaccine acceptance and clinical trial interest in western Uganda. Minority groups in the study i.e., Muslims, students, primary school leavers, un-married rural dwellers among others showed more interest in vaccination and clinical trials. We anticipated fears in the larger part of this community that health experts need to address through reassurance of the community that vaccines are tested and that they are safe and important if we are to rapidly contain the COVID-19 pandemic."
5847,"Testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2: Challenges in Getting Good Specimens, Choosing the Right Test, and Interpreting the Results.","Objectives: We explore ways to reduce errors in laboratory diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 infection by considering preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic sources. To address preanalytic challenges, we first consider alternative anatomic sites for specimen collection, then discuss self-collection, alternative sampling devices, and transport media. Strengths and limitations of various analytic test systems are considered in the context of postanalytic challenges associated with making test results meaningful, specifically considering the complex relationship between ""positive"" test results and reproduction and shedding of intact virus. Finally, we provide recommendations regarding healthcare worker surveillance and release of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 from isolation. Data sources: Material was derived from a Webinar available to the public, manufacturer's websites, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites and from both peer-reviewed papers identified by PubMed search and nonpeer-reviewed papers posted on Biorxiv and Medrxiv. Unpublished data came from the Washington State Department of Health. Study selection: We included studies that compared diagnostic performance strategies without introducing bias due to use of an imperfect gold standard. Case series and case reports were included as necessary to illuminate the significance of results. Data extraction: Data were extracted manually. Data synthesis: Sensitivity, specificity, and CIs were computed from article data using a composite reference standard. Nucleic acid-based tests were assumed to perform at 100% specificity. Conclusions: Although sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples provide the highest diagnostic sensitivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2, nasopharyngeal, mid turbinate, and nasal specimens are suitable in most cases and require less use of personal protective equipment. When desired sampling materials are unavailable, alternatives may be substituted with no loss of performance. Both reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests and rapid nucleic acid-based tests offer good performance in most circumstances. Testing is not required to release most patients from isolation."
5848,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Febrile Neonates.,"Most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in pediatric patients are mild or asymptomatic. However, infants have emerged at higher risk of hospitalization and severe outcomes in pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report a case series of 4 full-term neonates hospitalized with fever and found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection with a spectrum of illness severities. Two neonates required admission to the intensive care unit for respiratory insufficiency and end organ involvement. Half of the patients were found to have a coinfection. One neonate received antiviral therapy with remdesivir and is, to our knowledge, the youngest patient to receive this drug for COVID-19. All neonates had favorable outcomes."
5849,"Perceived Social Norms as Determinants of Adherence to Public Health Measures Related to COVID-19 in Bali, Indonesia.","Introduction: Before the widespread availability of an effective COVID-19 vaccine, it is crucial to control the rate of transmission by ensuring adherence to behavioral modifications, such as wearing masks, physical distancing, and washing hands, all of which can be implemented as public health measures. Focusing on the conditions in Bali, this study explored the level of compliance to public health measures targeted at COVID-19 and identified the determinants of compliance via the values, rules, and knowledge approach. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study conducted an online survey using the Google Form application from June 29 to July 5, 2020. The minimum required sample size was 664. Inclusion criteria were set as follows: 18 years of age or older and residing in Bali during the data collection period. Adherence was measured based on nine protocol indicators that were rated using a four-point Likert scale. A multiple linear regression analysis was then conducted to determine the associated factors of adherence to public health measures. Results: Of the 954 survey respondents, data from 743 were included for analysis. The average level of adherence to public health measures was 32.59 (range of 20-36). The linear regression analysis showed that perceived health benefits from public health measures, being female, and having COVID-19 test histories were significantly associated with adherence to public health measures. Conclusions: For public health measures targeted at COVID-19, adherence was strongly associated with perceived social norms, in which individuals played social community roles by adapting to standardized public health measures. It is thus imperative for governments to support and monitor public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic."
