8980,"The COVID-19 pandemic, heart and cardiovascular diseases: What we have learned.","In 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic overwhelmed the world, temporarily paralyzing healthcare and economic systems. Until now, we have learned a lot about the symptoms, pathophysiology, and complications of the disease as well as about the laboratory findings concerning the disease, and we are rapidly acquiring new data on the influence of COVID-19 on other aspects of human health beside its effects on the respiratory system. Patients with co-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are more frequently hospitalized, more likely to be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) and have poorer prognoses.In this article, we discuss the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on CVD, starting from the mechanisms connected with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, and then describing the main pathologies in the heart and vessels detected in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, we comment on the problem of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which may be triggered by viral infection. Finally, we discuss how, in some countries, the pandemic has changed treatment patterns, lowering the rate of invasive diagnostics and even falsely reducing the prevalence of CVD as a result of patients' fear of being admitted to hospital."

8982,Mask use during COVID-19: A risk adjusted strategy.,"In the context of Coronavirus Disease (2019) (COVID-19) cases globally, there is a lack of consensus across cultures on whether wearing face masks is an effective physical intervention against disease transmission. This study 1) illustrates transmission routes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); 2) addresses controversies surrounding the mask from perspectives of attitude, effectiveness, and necessity of wearing the mask with evidence that the use of mask would effectively interrupt the transmission of infectious diseases in both hospital settings and community settings; and 3) provides suggestion that the public should wear the mask during COVID-19 pandemic according to local context. To achieve this goal, government should establish a risk adjusted strategy of mask use to scientifically publicize the use of masks, guarantee sufficient supply of masks, and cooperate for reducing health resources inequities."
8983,Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load Response among COVID-19 Patients Receiving Favipiravir.,"We retrospectively studied nasopharyngeal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who were hospitalized between January 13 and April 1, 2020. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted using primers and probes targeting the ORF1ab and N genes. All patients were classified in the following groups: Group 1: received favipiravir + chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir for 5-10 days, Group 2: received chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir for 5-10 days, and Group 3: no antiviral medication. Among the 115 patients, 38 (33%), 54 (47%), and 23 (20%) were in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median (IQR) baseline viral loads on day 0 of Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 7.2 (6.0-8.1), 6.9 (5.8-7.8), and 6.9 (5.8-7.6) log10 copies/mL, respectively. The reductions of mean viral loads on day 3 from baseline were 2.41, 1.38, and 2.19 log10 copies/mL in the corresponding groups (P < 0.05). There were no differences in the reduction of mean viral loads from baseline among the three groups on days 5 and 10 (P > 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that receiving favipiravir was associated with nasopharyngeal viral load reduction at three days (P = 0.001). Significant nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction was achieved in COVID-19 patients who received a favipiravir-containing regimen."

Several studies are being carried out in several countries and some have yielded promising results; however, still no effective treatment has been identified to combat COVID-19, one of the most serious threats humanity has suffered in the last 100 years."
8985,Endocytosis and Transcytosis of SARS-CoV-2 Across the Intestinal Epithelium and Other Tissue Barriers.,"Since 2003, the world has been confronted with three new betacoronaviruses that cause human respiratory infections: SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), MERS-CoV, which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and SARS-CoV-2, which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The mechanisms of coronavirus transmission and dissemination in the human body determine the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. An important problem is the possibility that viral particles overcome tissue barriers such as the intestine, respiratory tract, blood-brain barrier, and placenta. In this work, we will 1) consider the issue of endocytosis and the possibility of transcytosis and paracellular trafficking of coronaviruses across tissue barriers with an emphasis on the intestinal epithelium; 2) discuss the possibility of antibody-mediated transcytosis of opsonized viruses due to complexes of immunoglobulins with their receptors; 3) assess the possibility of the virus transfer into extracellular vesicles during intracellular transport; and 4) describe the clinical significance of these processes. Models of the intestinal epithelium and other barrier tissues for in vitro transcytosis studies will also be briefly characterized."
8986,"As COVID-19 cases, deaths and fatality rates surge in Italy, underlying causes require investigation.","COVID-19 case fatalities surged during the month of March 2020 in Italy, reaching over 10,000 by 28 March 2020. This number exceeds the number of fatalities in China (3,301) recorded from January to March, even though the number of diagnosed cases was similar (85,000 Italy vs. 80,000 China). Case Fatality Rates (CFR) could be somewhat unreliable because the estimation of total case numbers is limited by several factors, including insufficient testing and limitations in test kits and materials, such as NP swabs and PPE for testers. Sero prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may help in more accurate estimations of the total number of cases. Nevertheless, the disparity in the differences in the total number of fatalities between Italy and China suggests investigation into several factors, such as demographics, sociological interactions, availability of medical equipment (ICU beds and PPE), variants in immune proteins (e.g., HLA, IFNs), past immunity to related CoVs, and mutations in SARS-CoV-2, could impact survival of severe COVID-19 illness survival and the number of case fatalities."

Lower income and less education were associated with greater parental vaccine hesitancy/resistance; safety and lack of need were primary reasons for vaccine hesitancy/resistance."
