6420,Allergic Reactions After COVID-19 Vaccination-Putting Risk Into Perspective.,
6421,COVID-19 and thalassaemia: A position statement of the Thalassaemia International Federation.,"Objectives: Many patients with haemoglobinopathies, including thalassaemia and sickle cell disease, are at increased risk of developing severe complications from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although epidemiologic evidence concerning the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection in these patients is currently lacking, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant challenge for haemoglobinopathy patients, their families and their attending physicians. Methods: The present statement summarizes the key challenges concerning the management of haemoglobinopathies, with particular focus on patients with either transfusion-dependent or non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia, identifies the gaps in knowledge and suggests measures and strategies to deal with the pandemic, based on available evidence and expert opinions. Key areas covered include patients' risk level, adaptation of haemoglobinopathy care, safety of blood transfusions, blood supply challenges, and lifestyle and nutritional considerations. Conclusions: The proposed measures and strategies may be useful as a blueprint for other disorders which require regular hospital visits, as well as for the timely adaptation of patient care during similar future pandemics."
6422,Weak correlation between antibody titers and neutralizing activity in sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects.,"Plenty of serologic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed so far, thus documenting the importance of evaluating the relevant features of the immune response to this viral agent. The performance of these assays is currently under investigation. Amongst them, LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG by DiaSorin and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 cobas® by Roche are currently used by laboratory medicine hospital departments in Italy and many other countries. In the present study, we firstly compared two serologic tests on serum samples collected at two different time points from 46 laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) subjects. Secondly, 85 negative serum samples collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were analyzed. Thirdly, possible correlations between antibody levels and the resulting neutralizing activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. Results revealed that both tests are endowed with low sensitivity on the day of hospital admission, which increased to 97.8% and 100% for samples collected after 15 days for DiaSorin and Roche tests, respectively. The specificity evaluated for the two tests ranges from 96.5% to 100%, respectively. Importantly, a poor direct correlation between antibody titers and neutralizing activity levels was evidenced in the present study. These data further shed light on both potentials and possible limitations related to SARS-CoV-2 serology. In this context, great efforts are still necessary for investigating antibody kinetics to develop novel diagnostic algorithms. Moreover, further investigations on the role of neutralizing antibodies and their correlate of protection will be of paramount importance for the development of effective vaccines."
6423,"Appropriateness for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for otolaryngologist and head and neck surgeons in case of pregnancy, breastfeeding, or childbearing potential: Yo-IFOS and CEORL-HNS joint clinical consensus statement.","Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are a key step in fighting the pandemic. Nevertheless, their rapid development did not allow for testing among specific population subgroups such as pregnant and breastfeeding women, or elaborating specific guidelines for healthcare personnel working in high infection risk specialties, such as otolaryngology (ORL). This clinical consensus statement (CCS) aims to offer guidance for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to this high-risk population based on the best evidence available. Methods: A multidisciplinary international panel of 33 specialists judged statements through a two-round modified Delphi method survey. Statements were designed to encompass the following topics: risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection and use of protective equipment in ORL; SARS-Cov-2 infection and vaccines and respective risks for the mother/child dyad; and counseling for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnant, breastfeeding, or fertile healthcare workers (PBFHW). All ORL PBFHW were considered as the target audience. Results: Of the 13 statements, 7 reached consensus or strong consensus, 2 reached no consensus, and 2 reached near-consensus. According to the statements with strong consensus otorhinolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or with childbearing potential should have the opportunity to receive SARS-Cov-2 vaccination. Moreover, personal protective equipment (PPE) should still be used even after the vaccination. Conclusion: Until prospective evaluations on these topics are available, ORL-HNS must be considered a high infection risk specialty. While the use of PPE remains pivotal, ORL PBFHW should be allowed access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination provided they receive up-to-date information."
6424,Case Studies in Physiology: Temporal variations of the lung parenchyma and vasculature in asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia: a multispectral CT assessment.,"This study reports systematic longitudinal pathophysiology of lung parenchymal and vascular effects of asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia in a young, healthy never-smoking male. Inspiratory and expiratory noncontrast along with contrast dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) scans of the chest were performed at baseline on the day of acute COVID-19 diagnosis (day 0), and across a 90-day period. Despite normal vital signs and pulmonary function tests on the day of diagnosis, the CT scans and corresponding quantification metrics detected abnormalities in parenchymal expansion based on image registration, ground-glass (GGO) texture (inflammation) as well as DECT-derived pulmonary blood volume (PBV). Follow-up scans on day 30 showed improvement in the lung parenchymal mechanics as well as reduced GGO and improved PBV distribution. Improvements in lung PBV continued until day 90. However, the heterogeneity of parenchymal mechanics and texture-derived GGO increased on days 60 and 90. We highlight that even asymptomatic COVID-19 infection with unremarkable vital signs and pulmonary function tests can have measurable effects on lung parenchymal mechanics and vascular pathophysiology, which may follow apparently different clinical courses. For this asymptomatic subject, post COVID-19 regional mechanics demonstrated persistent increased heterogeneity concomitant with return of elevated GGOs, despite early improvements in vascular derangement.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We characterized the temporal changes of lung parenchyma and microvascular pathophysiology from COVID-19 infection in an asymptomatic young, healthy nonsmoking male using dual-energy CT. Lung parenchymal mechanics and microvascular disease followed different clinical courses. Heterogeneous perfused blood volume became more uniform on follow-up visits up to 90 days. However, post COVID-19 mechanical heterogeneity of the lung parenchyma increased after apparent improvements in vascular abnormalities, even with normal spirometric indices."

6426,SARS-CoV-2: From the pathogenesis to potential anti-viral treatments.,"Introduction: The world is witnessing the spread of one of the members of Coronaviruses (CoVs) family, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the 21st century. Considering the short time spent after its prevalence, limited information is known about the effect of the virus mechanism on different organs of the body; meanwhile the lack of specific treatment and vaccine for this virus has exposed millions of people to a big challenge. Areas covered: The review article aims to describe the general and particular characteristics of CoVs, their classification, genome structure, host cell infection, cytokine storm, anti-viral treatments, and inhibition of COVID-19-related ER-mitochondrial stress. In addition, it refers to drugs such as Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, darunavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, and favipiravir, which have undergone clinical trials for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. This analysis was derived from an extensive scientific literature search including Pubmed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar performed. Expert opinion: The effectiveness rate and complications of these drugs can reveal new insights into the potential therapeutic goals for the disease. Moreover, lifestyle change can effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection."
6427,Mesenchymal Stem Cells as a Treatment Strategy for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Need for Authority Regulations and Clinical Guidelines.,"The cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly designated 2019-nCoV) was first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It then spread rapidly worldwide. Investigation for the discovery of drugs to cure this disease continues. The currently accepted treatments are supportive, but there is no specific disease curing intervention found yet. Since mid-February, therapies involving Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells (MSCs) have been proposed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In light of these recent developments, this review will focus on: i) the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 action and the subsequent pathology in COVID-19, ii) the proposed mechanism( s) of outcome-improving action of MSCs or MSC-derived extracellular vesicles in COVID-19 pneumonia, iii) registered MSC-based clinical trials and interventions for the treatment of COVID-19, iv) published case studies/series/trials reporting the use of MSC-based treatments in COVID-19 cases, and finally v) the need for authority regulations and clinical guidelines for MSCbased treatment strategies for COVID-19."
6428,Binding and Neutralization Antibody Titers After a Single Vaccine Dose in Health Care Workers Previously Infected With SARS-CoV-2.,This study compares titers of binding and neutralizing antibodies after a single mRNA coronavirus vaccine dose in health care workers previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.
6429,"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Different Settings, Brunei.","We report the transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across different settings in Brunei. An initial cluster of SARS-CoV-2 cases arose from 19 persons who had attended the Tablighi Jama'at gathering in Malaysia, resulting in 52 locally transmitted cases. The highest nonprimary attack rates (14.8%) were observed from a subsequent religious gathering in Brunei and in households of attendees (10.6%). Household attack rates from symptomatic case-patients were higher (14.4%) than from asymptomatic (4.4%) or presymptomatic (6.1%) case-patients. Workplace and social settings had attack rates of <1%. Our analyses highlight that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 varies depending on environmental, behavioral, and host factors. We identify red flags for potential superspreading events, specifically densely populated gatherings with prolonged exposure in enclosed settings, persons with recent travel history to areas with active SARS-CoV-2 infections, and group behaviors. We propose differentiated testing strategies to account for differing transmission risk."
