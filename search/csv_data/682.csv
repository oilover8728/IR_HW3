6810,An imperative to offer pregnant and lactating women access to the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out programme.,"In view of the continuing worldwide spread of COVID-19 infection, the increased morbidity and mortality from the disease during pregnancy, and the current efficacy and safety of vaccines in non-pregnant individuals, vaccines should not be withheld from women simply because of pregnancy or lactation. All pregnant women, especially healthcare professionals, should be offered vaccination and counselled about its advantages and disadvantages by their maternity care providers. Complete eradication of COVID-19 infection will be possible if potential niduses of the infection, which may act as sources for future outbreaks, are protected against the pathogen. However, if a hypothetical medication is the only means yet proven of limiting severe compromise to maternal health, access to the medication should be at the pregnant woman's discretion. Shared decision-making requires physicians to actively engage with their patients and share their knowledge about the subject matter."
6811,Sars-Cov-2 Infection Screening Using Two Serological Testing Methods.,"The challenges associated with adequate deployment of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in developing countries underscores the important role of simple but sensitive and specific serological testing kits in COVID-19 diagnosis. Presently, there are a number of point-of-care tests for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening. However, the reliability of these test kits is poorly documented and hence, needs to be ascertained. This study was therefore designed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two serological test kits for COVID-19 screening with the view to providing necessary information on the suitability of their deployment as routine test kits for SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria. Forty-seven (47) asymptomatic adults who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) were enrolled into this study. Blood samples were obtained for qualitative determination of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to the S-antigen of SARS-CoV-2 using a commercially available IgM and IgG Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The association between the test kits (ELISA and RDT) and PCR in diagnosing COVID-19 was determined using the Fisher's Exact test at P<0.05. The sensitivity and specificity of the test kits were determined using ROC while the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Positive Likelihood Ratio (PLR), Negative Likelihood Ratio (NLR), Diagnostic Odds Ratio (DOR) and accuracy were calculated as appropriate. Twenty-eight (59.6%) of the study participants had positive PCR result. ELISA and RDT identified 20 (42.6%) and 13 (27.7%) participants respectively as having anti- SARS COV-2 specific antibodies. ELISA had a better sensitivity performance, NPV, PLR, DOR and accuracy than the RDT while the RDT had a better specificity performance than ELISA. The proportion of participants with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody identified using ELISA was significantly higher compared with RDT. In contrast, the proportion of participants with positive anti- SARS COV-2 IgG antibody identified using RDT was significantly higher compared with ELISA. ELISA has a better sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike-protein specific antibodies than the RDT. However, combination of RDT and ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies might be useful for population COVID-19 screening."

6813,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune plasma workflow.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Among the various treatment proposals for COVID-19 infection, passive immunotherapy using plasma from recovering patients - ""convalescent plasma"" (CP)- could be a promising option in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Immune (i.e. ""convalescent"") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the use of plasma therapy is permitted when faced with «serious diseases for which there are no effective pharmacological treatments». Several clinical trials are underway to test the effectiveness of hyperimmune plasma at various stages of SARS-CoV2.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. regulatory authority, has approved the use of CP for compassionate use in the treatment of patients with a critical COVID-19 infection. Below are the general indications for drawing up clinical protocols for the integral management of ""COVID-19-convalescent plasma"" for which the validation and approval of the Ethics Committees is still necessary."
6814,From COVID-19 to Cancer mRNA Vaccines: Moving From Bench to Clinic in the Vaccine Landscape.,"Recently, mRNA vaccines have become a significant type of therapeutic and have created new fields in the biopharmaceutical industry. mRNA vaccines are promising next-generation vaccines that have introduced a new age in vaccinology. The recent approval of two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2) has accelerated mRNA vaccine technology and boosted the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. These mRNA vaccines will help to tackle COVID-19 pandemic through immunization, offering considerable hope for future mRNA vaccines. Human trials with data both from mRNA cancer vaccines and mRNA infectious disease vaccines have provided encouraging results, inspiring the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to focus on this area of research. In this article, we discuss current mRNA vaccines broadly in two parts. In the first part, mRNA vaccines in general and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are discussed. We presented the mRNA vaccine structure in general, the different delivery systems, the immune response, and the recent clinical trials for mRNA vaccines (both for cancer mRNA vaccines and different infectious diseases mRNA vaccines). In the second part, different COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are explained. Finally, we illustrated a snapshot of the different leading mRNA vaccine developers, challenges, and future prospects of mRNA vaccines."
6815,"Polymer-based nano-therapies to combat COVID-19 related respiratory injury: progress, prospects, and challenges.","The recent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has increased at an alarming rate, representing a substantial cause of mortality worldwide. Respiratory injuries are major COVID-19 related complications, leading to poor lung circulation, tissue scarring, and airway obstruction. Despite an in-depth investigation of respiratory injury's molecular pathogenesis, effective treatments have yet to be developed. Moreover, early detection of viral infection is required to halt the disease-related long-term complications, including respiratory injuries. The currently employed detection technique (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or qRT-PCR) failed to meet this need at some point because it is costly, time-consuming, and requires higher expertise and technical skills. Polymer-based nanobiosensing techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations. Polymeric nanomaterials have the potential for clinical applications due to their versatile features like low cytotoxicity, biodegradability, bioavailability, biocompatibility, and specific delivery at the targeted site of action. In recent years, innovative polymeric nanomedicine approaches have been developed to deliver therapeutic agents and support tissue growth for the inflamed organs, including the lung. This review highlights the most recent advances of polymer-based nanomedicine approaches in infectious disease diagnosis and treatments. This paper also focuses on the potential of novel nanomedicine techniques that may prove to be therapeutically efficient in fighting against COVID-19 related respiratory injuries."
6816,Hand disinfection in the combat against COVID-19.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency over a new coronavirus. The new corona virus (SARS‐CoV‐2) has raised global attention with raising concerns of rapid spread from human‐to‐human. Like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐nCoV, 2019‐nCoV can be passed directly from person to person by respiratory droplets, and may also be transmitted through contact and fomites."
6817,Laboratory diagnosis of emerging human coronavirus infections - the state of the art.,"The three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus (HCoV) infections at the beginning of the twenty-first century have highlighted the necessity for readily available, accurate and fast diagnostic testing methods. The laboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients."
