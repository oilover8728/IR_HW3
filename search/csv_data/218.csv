2170,Are Lockdown Measures Effective Against COVID-19?,"As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic progresses, countries around the world are increasingly implementing a range of responses that are intended to help prevent the transmission of this disease. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of containment measures to suppress the virus transmission, thereby slowing down the growth rate of cases and rapidly reducing case incidence. The aim of this study is to show that country lockdown has a critical and significant impact on the pandemic. This is explored using real time incidence data in Lebanon. We analyze COVID-19 cases in Lebanon before and after lockdown measures have been implemented. The findings show that the nationwide lockdown was effective in reducing cases and has been successful in, so far, containing the virus. This study could be an evidence-based call to continue with the lockdown measures, based on real time incidence data. Further research is encouraged."

2173,ABO blood group and SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in a convalescent donor population.,"Background and objectives: ABO blood group may affect risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or severity of COVID-19. We sought to determine whether IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibody (nAb) to SARS-CoV-2 vary by ABO blood group. Materials and methods: Among eligible convalescent plasma donors, ABO blood group was determined via agglutination of reagent A1 and B cells, IgA and IgG were quantified using the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, and nAb titres were quantified using a microneutralization assay. Differences in titre distribution were examined by ABO blood group using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of high nAb titre (≥1:160) were estimated by blood group using multivariable modified Poisson regression models that adjusted for age, sex, hospitalization status and time since SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Results: Of the 202 potential donors, 65 (32%) were blood group A, 39 (19%) were group B, 13 (6%) were group AB, and 85 (42%) were group O. Distribution of nAb titres significantly differed by ABO blood group, whereas there were no significant differences in anti-spike IgA or anti-spike IgG titres by ABO blood group. There were significantly more individuals with high nAb titre (≥1:160) among those with blood group B, compared with group O (aPR = 1·9 [95%CI = 1·1-3·3], P = 0·029). Fewer individuals had a high nAb titre among those with blood group A, compared with group B (aPR = 0·6 [95%CI = 0·4-1·0], P = 0·053). Conclusion: Eligible CCP donors with blood group B may have relatively higher neutralizing antibody titres. Additional studies evaluating ABO blood groups and antibody titres that incorporate COVID-19 severity are needed."
2174,"Plastic residues produced with confirmatory testing for COVID-19: Classification, quantification, fate, and impacts on human health.","In March 2020, several international organizations started making recommendations regarding the need for prompt coronavirus-based diagnosis in order to prevent its spread among the world's population. The most widely used test for confirmation of COVID-19 is real-time PCR (RT-PCR). This technique uses plastic supplies in its procedures, which are 100% disposable to avoid cross-contamination and biological risks. The scientific community has become increasingly worried because of the environmental impacts associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, such as medical plastic residues. We classified and estimated the amount of plastic residues generated as a consequence of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and analyzed the relationships of the plastics generated with number of confirmed cases, population size, and gross domestic product in each country. We evidenced that the RT-PCR generates 37.27 g of plastic residues per sample. All patients COVID-19 tested with RT-PCR have generated 15,439.59 tons of plastic residue worldwide, until August 2020. The plastic residues generated by the COVID-19 tests have no relation with size population or gross domestic product of the countries. There is also no relationship between the plastic residues generated by the COVID-19 tests and the confirmed cases. About 97% of the plastic residues from diagnostic tests for coronavirus are incinerated due to their hazardous nature to humans, but toxic chemicals are released into the environment during the process. In the short term, there is a need to reduce plastic waste and improve controls of gas emissions from incineration plants in countries where there is a deficit. In the long term, biodegradable biomedical manufacturing that are free of releasing toxic chemicals when they are incinerated, must be considered."
2175,Chemotherapy vs. Immunotherapy in combating nCOVID19: An update.,"The nCOVID-19 pandemic initiated its course of contagion from the city of Wuhan and now it has spread all over the globe. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative virus and the infection as well as its symptoms are distributed across the multi-organ perimeters. Interactions between the host and virus governs the induction of 'cytokine storm' resulting various immunopathological consequences leading to death. Till now it has caused tens of millions of casualties and yet no credible cure has emerged to vision. This article presents a comprehensive overview on the two most promising remedial approaches that are being attempted for the management, treatment, and plausible cure of nCOVID-19. In this context, chemotherapeutic approach primarily aims to interrupt the interactions between the host and the virus causing inhibition of its entry into the host cell and/or its proliferation and suppressing the inflammatory milieu in the infected patients. On the other side, immunotherapeutic approaches aim to modulate the host immunity by fine tuning the inflammatory signaling cascades to achieve phylaxis from the virus and restoring immune-homeostasis. Considering most of the path-breaking findings, combinatorial therapy involving of chemotherapeutics as well as vaccine could usher to be a hope for all of us to eradicate the crisis."

2178,Back to normal; serological testing for COVID-19 diagnosis unveils missed infections.,"Background: The gold standard for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis has been the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). On the other hand, serological testing for COVID-19 may offer advantages in detecting possibly overlooked infections by NAAT. Methods: To evaluate seroconversion of NAAT-negative pneumonia patients, immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were semiquantified by an immunofluorescence assay. Seroconversion was confirmed by another serological method, targeting the nucleocapsid protein. Results: Eight suspected but unconfirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients (median age, 39 years; range, 21-55) were included. The median period between symptom onset and NAAT sample collection was 6 days (2-27 days). None of them had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NAAT. In contrast, all eight patients revealed seropositivity with the two serological methods, indicating actual seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. The median period between onset and blood sampling was 26.5 days (7-51 days). Conclusion: Eight patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, initially tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by NAAT, were finally confirmed of the diagnosis by serological testing. To cover the whole spectrum of this heterogenous infectious disease, serology testing should be implemented to the multitiered diagnostic algorithm for COVID-19."
2179,Detection of Coronavirus in Tear Samples of Hospitalized Patients With Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 From Oropharyngeal Swabs.,"Purpose: This study was designed to detect CoV-RNA in the tears of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Methods: We performed a prospective case series study of hospitalized patients who have been confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive by oropharyngeal swab within the previous 5 days. Tear samples obtained with a laboratory capillary and oropharyngeal swabs were analyzed by real-time PCR using the Altona SARS-CoV-2 Assay or the Roche SARS-CoV-2 LightMix PCR, depending on the availability. Patient history was documented, and ophthalmoscopy was used to assess for ocular surface disease. Results: Of all 18 patients recruited in April 2020, 5 suffered from respiratory failure and were submitted to an intensive care unit. None of our patients had signs of viral conjunctivitis although all patients in intensive care showed chemosis and conjunctival hyperemia because of third-spacing or fluid overload. The presence of coronavirus RNA was confirmed by PCR in 5 of 18 patients (28%) in tears and 72% for oropharyngeal swabs. Conclusions: Using a tear fluid sampling technique similar to oropharyngeal lavage presents a higher percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive tears in contrast to earlier reports that used a conjunctival swab. This does not automatically indicate viral shedding in ocular tissue or contagiousness of tear fluid."
