9050,The costs of an expanded screening criteria for COVID-19: A modelling study.,"Objectives: Nosocomial infection is an ongoing concern in the COVID-19 outbreak. The effective screening of suspected cases in the healthcare setting is therefore necessary, enabling the early identification and prompt isolation of cases for epidemic containment. We aimed to assess the cost and health outcomes of an extended screening strategy, implemented in Singapore on 07 February 2020, which maximizes case identification in the public healthcare system. Methods: We explored the effects of the expanded screening criteria which allow clinicians to isolate and investigate patients presenting with undifferentiated fever or respiratory symptoms or chest x-ray abnormalities. We formulated a cost appraisal framework which evaluated the treatment costs averted from the prevention of secondary transmission in the hospital setting, as determined by a branching process infection model, and compared these to the costs of the additional testing required to meet the criteria. Results: In the base case analysis, an R0 of 2.5 and incubation period of 4 days, an estimated 239 (95% CI: 201-287) cases could be averted over 150 days within the hospital setting through ESC. A corresponding $2.36 (2-2.85) million USD in costs could be averted with net cost savings of $124,000 (95% CI: -334,000 to 516,000). In the sensitivity analyses, when positive identification rates (PIR) were above 7%, regardless of R0 and incubation period, all scenarios were cost-saving. Conclusion: The expanded screening criteria can help to identify and promptly isolate positive COVID cases in a cost-saving manner or within acceptable cost margins where the costs incurred from the testing of negative patients could be negated by the averted costs. Outbreak control must be sustainable and effective; the proposed screening criteria should be considered to mitigate nosocomial transmission risk within healthcare facilities."
9051,"International trade as critical parameter of COVID-19 spread that outclasses demographic, economic, environmental, and pollution factors.","The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), generating high numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths, is still circulating in 2021 with new variants of the coronavirus, such that the state of emergency remains in manifold countries. Currently, there is still a lack of a full understanding of the factors determining the COVID-19 diffusion that clarify the causes of the variability of infections across different provinces and regions within countries. The main goal of this study is to explain new and main determinants underlying the diffusion of COVID-19 in society. This study focuses on international trade because this factor, in a globalized world, can synthetize different drivers of virus spread, such as mobility patterns, economic potentialities, and social interactions of an investigated areas. A case study research is performed on 107 provinces of Italy, one of the first countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Statistical analyses from March 2020 to February 2021 suggest that total import and export of provinces has a high association with confirmed cases over time (average r > 0.78, p-value <.001). Overall, then, this study suggests total import and export as complex indicator of COVID-19 transmission dynamics that outclasses other common parameters used to justify the COVID-19 spread, given by economic, demographic, environmental, and climate factors. In addition, this study proposes, for the first time, a time-dependent correlation analysis between trade data and COVID-19 infection cases to explain the relation between confirmed cases and social interactions that are a main source of the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent negative impact in society. These novel findings have main theoretical and practical implications directed to include a new parameter in modelling of the diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic to support effective policy responses of crisis management directed to constrain the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and similar infectious diseases in society."
9052,First Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 on the Surfaces of Tourist-Recreational Facilities in Italy.,"A Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a new virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spreads via direct contact through droplets produced by infected individuals. The transmission of this virus can also occur via indirect contact if objects and surfaces are contaminated by secretions from individuals with COVID-19 or asymptomatic carriers. Environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 is high in hospital settings; on the contrary, surface contamination in non-healthcare settings is still poorly studied. In this study, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the surfaces of 20 tourist-recreational facilities was investigated by performing a total of 100 swabs on surfaces, including refrigerator handles, handrails, counters, tables, and bathroom access doors. Six (6%) swabs from four (20%) tourist-recreational facilities tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; the surfaces that were involved were toilet door handles, refrigerator handles, handrails, and bar counters. This study highlights that SARS-CoV-2 is also present in non-healthcare environments; therefore, in order to limit this worrying pandemic, compliance with behavioral rules and the adoption of preventive and protective measures are of fundamental importance not only in healthcare or work environments but also in life environments."
9053,Xerostomia and Taste Alterations in COVID-19.,"A recent letter published in the Ear, Nose & Throat Journal called attention to the hypothesis that the xerostomia reported in patients with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurs due to the neuroinvasive and neurotropism potential of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In fact, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), the main site of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, was found to be present in the ductal elements of salivary gland and several other tissues. However, some points are worth to be addressed."
9054,An in-silico evaluation of different Saikosaponins for their potency against SARS-CoV-2 using NSP15 and fusion spike glycoprotein as targets.,"The Public Health Emergency of International Concern declared the widespread outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a global pandemic emergency, which has resulted in 1,773,086 confirmed cases including 111,652 human deaths, as on 13 April 2020, as reported to World Health Organization. As of now, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs declared to be officially useful against the infection. Saikosaponin is a group of oleanane derivatives reported in Chinese medicinal plants and are described for their anti-viral, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antinephritis and hepatoprotective activities. They have also been known to have anti-coronaviral property by interfering the early stage of viral replication including absorption and penetration of the virus. Thus, the present study was undertaken to screen and evaluate the potency of different Saikosaponins against different sets of SARS-CoV-2 binding protein via computational molecular docking simulations. Docking was carried out on a Glide module of Schrodinger Maestro 2018-1 MM Share Version on NSP15 (PDB ID: 6W01) and Prefusion 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VSB) from SARS-CoV-2. From the binding energy and interaction studies, the Saikosaponins U and V showed the best affinity towards both the proteins suggesting them to be future research molecule as they mark the desire interaction with NSP15, which is responsible for replication of RNA and also with 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein which manage the connection with ACE2.

9055,Discovery of re-purposed drugs that slow SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells.,"COVID-19 vaccines based on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been developed that appear to be largely successful in stopping infection. However, therapeutics that can help manage the disease are still required until immunity has been achieved globally. The identification of repurposed drugs that stop SARS-CoV-2 replication could have enormous utility in stemming the disease. Here, using a nano-luciferase tagged version of the virus (SARS-CoV-2-Î”Orf7a-NLuc) to quantitate viral load, we evaluated a range of human cell types for their ability to be infected and support replication of the virus, and performed a screen of 1971 FDA-approved drugs. Hepatocytes, kidney glomerulus, and proximal tubule cells were particularly effective in supporting SARS-CoV-2 replication, which is in-line with reported proteinuria and liver damage in patients with COVID-19. Using the nano-luciferase as a measure of virus replication we identified 35 drugs that reduced replication in Vero cells and human hepatocytes when treated prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and found amodiaquine, atovaquone, bedaquiline, ebastine, LY2835219, manidipine, panobinostat, and vitamin D3 to be effective in slowing SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells when used to treat infected cells. In conclusion, our study has identified strong candidates for drug repurposing, which could prove powerful additions to the treatment of COVID."

9057,Tocilizumab: From Rheumatic Diseases to COVID-19.,"Tocilizumab is a humanised interleukin-6 receptor-inhibiting monoclonal antibody that is currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other immune-related conditions. Recently, tocilizumab has been investigated as a possible treatment for severe coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite the lack of direct antiviral effects, tocilizumab could reduce the immune-induced organ damage caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. Until recently, most reports on tocilizumab for COVID-19 included a limited number of patients, preventing an overall evaluation of its efficacy and safety for this specific condition. Therefore, we reviewed the literature regarding the physiopathological rationale of tocilizumab for COVID-19 and its outcomes. We searched the MEDLINE database with the string ""(SARS-CoV-2 OR coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR MERS- cov OR SARS-cov) AND (IL-6 OR interleukin 6 OR tocilizumab)"". While the scientific rationale supporting tocilizumab for COVID-19 is solid, the evidence regarding the outcomes remains controversial. Available data and results from ongoing trials will provide useful information in the event of new COVID-19 outbreaks or future pandemics from different coronaviruses."
9058,Dating the Common Ancestor from an NCBI Tree of 83688 High-Quality and Full-Length SARS-CoV-2 Genomes.,"All dating studies involving SARS-CoV-2 are problematic. Previous studies have dated the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) between SARS-CoV-2 and its close relatives from bats and pangolins. However, the evolutionary rate thus derived is expected to differ from the rate estimated from sequence divergence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Here, I present dating results for the first time from a large phylogenetic tree with 86,582 high-quality full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The tree contains 83,688 genomes with full specification of collection time. Such a large tree spanning a period of about 1.5 years offers an excellent opportunity for dating the MRCA of the sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The MRCA is dated 16 August 2019, with the evolutionary rate estimated to be 0.05526 mutations/genome/day. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the root-to-tip distance (D) and the collection time (T) is 0.86295. The NCBI tree also includes 10 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from cats, collected over roughly the same time span as human COVID-19 infection. The MRCA from these cat-derived SARS-CoV-2 is dated 30 July 2019, with r = 0.98464. While the dating method is well known, I have included detailed illustrations so that anyone can repeat the analysis and obtain the same dating results. With 16 August 2019 as the date of the MRCA of sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes, archived samples from respiratory or digestive tracts collected around or before 16 August 2019, or those that are not descendants of the existing SARS-CoV-2 lineages, should be particularly valuable for tracing the origin of SARS-CoV-2."
9059,One hundred thirty-three observed COVID-19 deaths in 10 months: unpacking lower than predicted mortality in Rwanda.,"The African region was predicted to have worse COVID-19 infection and death rates due to challenging health systems and social determinants of health. However, in the 10 months after its first case, Rwanda recorded 10316 cases and 133 COVID-19-related deaths translating to a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.3%, which raised the question: why does Rwanda have a low COVID-19 CFR? Here we analysed COVID-19 data and explored possible explanations to better understand the disease burden in the context of Rwanda's infection control strategies.We investigated whether the age distribution plays a role in the observed low CFR in Rwanda by comparing the expected number of deaths for 10-year age bands based on the CFR reported in other countries with the observed number of deaths for each age group. We found that the age-specific CFRs in Rwanda are similar to or, in some older age groups, slightly higher than those in other countries, suggesting that the lower population level CFR reflects the younger age structure in Rwanda, rather than a lower risk of death conditional on age. We also accounted for Rwanda's comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies and reliable documentation of COVID-19-related deaths and deduced that these measures may have allowed them to likely identify more asymptomatic or mild cases than other countries and reduced their reported CFR.Overall, the observed low COVID-19 deaths in Rwanda is likely influenced by the combination of effective infection control strategies, reliable identification of cases and reporting of deaths, and the population's young age structure."
