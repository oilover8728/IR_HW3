8830,"Evaluation of Abbott BinaxNOW Rapid Antigen Test for SARS-CoV-2 Infection at Two Community-Based Testing Sites - Pima County, Arizona, November 3-17, 2020.","Rapid antigen tests, such as the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card (BinaxNOW), offer results more rapidly (approximately 15-30 minutes) and at a lower cost than do highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) (1). Rapid antigen tests have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in symptomatic persons (2), but data are lacking on test performance in asymptomatic persons to inform expanded screening testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons (3). To evaluate the performance of the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test, it was used along with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to analyze 3,419 paired specimens collected from persons aged ≥10 years at two community testing sites in Pima County, Arizona, during November 3-17, 2020. Viral culture was performed on 274 of 303 residual real-time RT-PCR specimens with positive results by either test (29 were not available for culture). Compared with real-time RT-PCR testing, the BinaxNOW antigen test had a sensitivity of 64.2% for specimens from symptomatic persons and 35.8% for specimens from asymptomatic persons, with near 100% specificity in specimens from both groups. Virus was cultured from 96 of 274 (35.0%) specimens, including 85 (57.8%) of 147 with concordant antigen and real-time RT-PCR positive results, 11 (8.9%) of 124 with false-negative antigen test results, and none of three with false-positive antigen test results. Among specimens positive for viral culture, sensitivity was 92.6% for symptomatic and 78.6% for asymptomatic individuals. When the pretest probability for receiving positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 is elevated (e.g., in symptomatic persons or in persons with a known COVID-19 exposure), a negative antigen test result should be confirmed by NAAT (1). Despite a lower sensitivity to detect infection, rapid antigen tests can be an important tool for screening because of their quick turnaround time, lower costs and resource needs, high specificity, and high positive predictive value (PPV) in settings of high pretest probability. The faster turnaround time of the antigen test can help limit transmission by more rapidly identifying infectious persons for isolation, particularly when used as a component of serial testing strategies."
8831,Dentistry and the COVID-19 Outbreak.,"Introduction: Infection prevention in dental practice is a principle of utmost importance aiming to protect patients, the dental team, and ultimately, public health. The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has instigated worldwide public concern. This highly contagious disease has called for profound changes in patient care around the world. The goal of this article is to review the current literature and introduce essential knowledge about COVID-19, recommend management protocols and adequate protection for dental professionals during the outbreak. Material and methods: The literature search was conducted from April to June 2020. After full-text screening a total of 85 studies were included. Results: Given the novelty of SARS-CoV-2, some characteristics of the virus remain yet unknown. The virus is aerosol-transmissible and, because of the nature of dental procedures, this puts dental professionals and patients at a high risk of contamination by this pathogen. Adequate management protocols and specific protective approaches are essential to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in dental settings during the outbreak. Discussion: The overall impact of COVID-19 in health care worldwide is yet to be determined. This constitutes a significant limitation to this review because the information obtained risks being outdated as the pandemic progresses. The prudent practitioner will use this review as a starting point and continue to proactively update themselves as the outbreak continues. Further studies are required to investigate the potential impact of infections with SARS-CoV-2 within dental settings."
8832,COVID-19 convalescent plasma treatment of moderate and severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection: A multicenter interventional study.,"Objective: To study the effectiveness of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) therapy for patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 disease. Methods: This non-randomized prospective cohort study was conducted from May 21 to June 30, 2020, at four major tertiary hospitals in Kuwait. CCP was administered to 135 patients. The control group comprised 233 patients who received standard treatment. All patients (N = 368, median age 54 [range 15-82]) had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and either moderate or severe COVID-19 disease. Results: CCP treatment was associated with a higher rate of clinical improvement in patients with moderate or severe disease. Among those with moderate COVID-19 disease, time to clinical improvement was 7 days in the CCP group, versus 8 days in the control group (p = 0·006). For severe COVID-19 disease, time to clinical improvement was 7 days in the CCP group, versus 15.5 days in the control group (p = 0·003). In the adjusted analysis, patients with moderate disease treated with CCP had a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate. Compared to the control group, oxygen saturation improved within 3 days of CCP transfusion, and lymphocyte counts improved from day 7 in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease and day 11 in patients with severe disease. C-reactive protein levels declined throughout the first 14 days after CCP transfusion. None of the CCP patients developed a serious transfusion reaction. Conclusions: The data show that administration of CCP is a safe treatment option for patients with COVID-19 disease with a favorable outcome in the rate of, and time to, clinical improvement."
8833,Intractable Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Prolonged Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Replication in a Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Modified T-Cell Therapy Recipient: A Case Study.,"A chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell therapy recipient developed severe coronavirus disease 2019, intractable RNAemia, and viral replication lasting >2 months. Premortem endotracheal aspirate contained >2 × 1010 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA copies/mL and infectious virus. Deep sequencing revealed multiple sequence variants consistent with intrahost virus evolution. SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cell-mediated immunity were minimal. Prolonged transmission from immunosuppressed patients is possible."
8834,[Treatment strategy and thought on classical herbal formulae for coronavirus disease 2019].,"Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) refers to the pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection in 2019. It is highly infectious, with quick spreading and a wide range of impact. It has been broken out in many countries around the world and has become a public health emergency of international concern. Chinese medicine has a long history in treating plague, and viral disease is the clinical advantage in Chinese medicine. Under the premise that there is currently no specific drug treatment, Chinese medicine has achieved certain effects in the treatment of COVID-19, which has attracted much attention and has been upgraded to a national strategy. Regarding the treatment of COVID-19 with Chinese medicine, it is believed that in terms of the name of Chinese medicine, the modern connotation of &quot;uniform of typhoid and febrile disease&quot; should be re-recognized, and it is advisable to use drugs based on specific clinical prescriptions and indications. In terms of pathogenesis, the COVID-19 has the pathogenesis rules including from the mild to severe conditions, from the surface to the inside, from the excess syndrome to the deficiency syndrome. We should pay attention to the Taiyang syndrome damaged by wet disease in initial stage, Shaoyang syndrome complicated with Yangming syndrome in the middle stage, phlegm-heat obstructing lung in critical period, lung and spleen deficiency in the recovery stage. In terms of clinical treatment strategies, Dayuan Yin is recommended to induce sweat and disperse the stasis in early stage. Xiaochaihu Decoction and Maxing Shigan Decoction is used to relieve both exterior and interior symptoms in middle stage. In critical stage, Tingli Dazao Xiefei Decoction, Weijing Decoction, Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction, Xiaoxianxiong Decoction, and Sanzi Yangqin Decoction are considered to reduce phlegm and clear heat. We should pay attention to nourishing Qi and strengthening the spleen by Zhuye Shigao Decoction, Sha-shen Maidong Decoction, and Liujunzi Decoction in the later recovery period. It shall be noted that, no matter in the initial mild stage, the middle and critical stages, or in the later recovery stage, Chinese medicine plays an important role, including preventing mild to severe disease, shortening the fever time, improving cough symptoms, increasing blood oxygen saturation and reducing mortality. Many studies have shown that the classical herbal formulae can alleviate the cytokine storm, regulate the immune imbalance, and produce the potential effect of synergistic treatment for COVID-19 through multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways."
8835,"Epidemiology of Coronavirus Disease Outbreak among Crewmembers on Cruise Ship, Nagasaki City, Japan, April 2020.","In April 2020, a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak occurred on the cruise ship Costa Atlantica in Nagasaki, Japan. Our outbreak investigation included 623 multinational crewmembers onboard on April 20. Median age was 31 years; 84% were men. Each crewmember was isolated or quarantined in a single room inside the ship, and monitoring of health status was supported by a remote health monitoring system. Crewmembers with more severe illness were hospitalized. The investigation found that the outbreak started in late March and peaked in late April, resulting in 149 laboratory-confirmed and 107 probable cases of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Six case-patients were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, including 1 in severe condition and 2 who required oxygen administration, but no deaths occurred. Although the virus can spread rapidly on a cruise ship, we describe how prompt isolation and quarantine combined with a sensitive syndromic surveillance system can control a COVID-19 outbreak."
8836,Alcohol-free hand sanitizer and other quaternary ammonium disinfectants quickly and effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the current global pandemic, COVID-19. Because this virus is novel, little is known about its sensitivity to disinfection. Methods: We performed suspension tests against SARS-CoV-2 using three commercially available quaternary ammonium compound (Quat) disinfectants and one laboratory-made 0.2% benzalkonium chloride solution. Findings: Three of the four formulations completely inactivated the virus within 15 s of contact, even in the presence of a soil load or when diluted in hard water. Conclusion: Quats rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2, making them potentially useful for controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread in hospitals and the community."
8837,Vaccine development for emerging infectious diseases.,"Examination of the vaccine strategies and technical platforms used for the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of those used for previous emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and pandemics may offer some mutually beneficial lessons. The unprecedented scale and rapidity of dissemination of recent emerging infectious diseases pose new challenges for vaccine developers, regulators, health authorities and political constituencies. Vaccine manufacturing and distribution are complex and challenging. While speed is essential, clinical development to emergency use authorization and licensure, pharmacovigilance of vaccine safety and surveillance of virus variants are also critical. Access to vaccines and vaccination needs to be prioritized in low- and middle-income countries. The combination of these factors will weigh heavily on the ultimate success of efforts to bring the current and any future emerging infectious disease pandemics to a close."
8838,COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Focus on immunosuppression management.,"Background: The coronavirus disease of 2019, also known as COVID-19, has been declared a global pandemic. Significant controversies exist regarding treatment modalities for this novel disease, especially in immunocompromised patients. Experience with management of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients is scarce; effects of this virus on immunosuppressed individuals are not well understood. Methods: We identified 30 renal transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to inpatient between March 2020 and April 2020. All patients received a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; half of the patients received methylprednisolone. During hospitalization, calcineurin inhibitors and antimetabolites were held; prednisone was continued. Results: Clinical presentation of flu-like symptoms was similar to those in the general population. Hyponatremia, lymphopenia, acute kidney injury, and elevated inflammatory markers were common. Over the course of follow-up, 23 have been discharged home with a functioning allograft and in stable condition; 4 experienced acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy; 7 patients were intubated, and 6 expired. The mortality rate in our cohort was 20%. Conclusion: Our findings described the characteristics and outcomes of this highly fatal illness in a multi-ethnic kidney transplant cohort, with insights on immunosuppression management that could further our understanding of this unique disease in immunocompromised populations."
8839,SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by the numbers.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a harsh reminder of the fact that, whether in a single human host or a wave of infection across continents, viral dynamics is often a story about the numbers. In this article we provide a one-stop, curated graphical source for the key numbers (based mostly on the peer-reviewed literature) about the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is responsible for the pandemic. The discussion is framed around two broad themes: i) the biology of the virus itself; ii) the characteristics of the infection of a single human host."
