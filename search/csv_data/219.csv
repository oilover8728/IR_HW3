2180,Saliva samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.,"Background: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has been rapidly spreading throughout the world with confirmed case numbers already exceeding 75 million. Although nasopharyngeal swabs are the most commonly utilized samples for based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection, collecting these specimens requires healthcare workers and necessitates the use of personal protective equipment as it presents a nosocomial transmission risk. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with confirmed Covid-19. Methods: We performed a cohort study to validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19. Saliva samples of the patients were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: In May 2020, 28 asymptomatic and 25 mildly symptomatic patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 37 years (range 4-70). None of the patients had a fever on presentation. Among 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected in the nasopharyngeal sample, the real-time RT-PCR was positive in the saliva specimens in 48 (90.56%) patients. The mean cycle threshold (CT) values for nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens (27.80 ± 3.44 and 30.64 ± 2.83, respectively) were significantly correlated between the two sample types (p = .016). The mean CT values of nasopharyngeal and saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (27.18 ± 3.53 and 30.24 ± 3.29 vs. 28.36 ± 3.31 and 30.98 ± 2.39, respectively) were not significantly different (p = .236 and p = .733, respectively). Conclusions: Saliva specimens can be considered as a reliable and less resource-intensive alternative to nasopharyngeal specimens for screening asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections."
2181,"Direct and Indirect Effectiveness of mRNA Vaccination against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Long-Term Care Facilities, Spain.","We conducted a registries-based cohort study of long-term care facility residents >65 years of age offered vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 before March 10, 2021, in Spain. Risk for infection in vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons was compared with risk in the same persons in a period before the vaccination campaign, adjusted by daily-varying incidence and reproduction number. We selected 299,209 persons; 99.0% had >1 dose, 92.6% had 2 doses, and 99.8% of vaccines were Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2). For vaccinated persons with no previous infection, vaccine effectiveness was 81.8% (95% CI 81.0%-82.7%), and 11.6 (95% CI 11.3-11.9) cases were prevented per 10,000 vaccinated/day. In those with previous infection, effectiveness was 56.8% (95% CI 47.1%-67.7%). In nonvaccinated residents with no previous infection, risk decreased by up to 81.4% (95% CI 73.3%-90.3%). Our results confirm vaccine effectiveness in this population and suggest indirect protection in nonvaccinated persons."
2182,Seroprevalence Study and Cross-Sectional Survey on COVID-19 for a Plan to Reopen the University of Alicante (Spain).,"The implementation of strategies to mitigate possible cases of COVID-19 were addressed at the University of Alicante for the safe reopening of the 2020/2021 academic year. To discover the prevalence of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, a study was designed using a rapid immunoassay test (carried out between 6 and 22 July 2020), and in addition a cross-sectional survey was conducted on risk factors, symptoms, predisposition for becoming vaccinated, and sources of information about COVID-19. A random sample, stratified by students, faculty, and administrative staff, was selected. The seroprevalence found was 2.64% (39/1479; 95% CI 1.8-3.4), and the adjusted seroprevalence was 2.89% (95% CI 2.1-3.7). The average age of the students was 23.2 years old, and 47.6 years old for staff. In relation to COVID-19, the following was found: 17.7% pauci-symptomatic, 1.3% symptomatic, 5.5% contact with cases, 4.9% confined, and 0.3% PCR positive. More than 90% complied with preventive measures. The proportion willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was 91%. Their sources of information were the Internet (74%) and television (70.1%). They requested that the university offer information (45.1%), training (27%), and provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (26.3%). Lastly, 87.9% would repeat the test. A plan was established that included the follow-up of cases and contacts, random sample testing, training courses, bimodal teaching, a specific website, and the distribution of PPE."
2183,Cocooning against COVID-19: The argument for vaccinating caregivers of patients with cancer.,"Current national COVID‐19 vaccination guidelines and recommendations focus vaccine guidance on patients with cancer. In this COVID‐19 vaccination race, “cocoon vaccination” strategies which include informal caregivers and household contacts as priority groups for SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination could be an additional strategy used to protect patients with cancer who may have limited immune responses to current vaccinations. Medical systems specializing in cancer care should support education and vaccination campaigns which target informal caregivers and household contacts in addition to cancer patients."

2186,COVID-19 and Bangladesh: Challenges and How to Address Them.,"As the coronavirus outbreak quickly surges worldwide, many countries are adopting non-therapeutic preventive measures, which include travel bans, remote office activities, country lockdown, and most importantly, social distancing. However, these measures face challenges in Bangladesh, a lower-middle-income economy with one of the world's densest populations. Social distancing is difficult in many areas of the country, and with the minimal resources the country has, it would be extremely challenging to implement the mitigation measures. Mobile sanitization facilities and temporary quarantine sites and healthcare facilities could help mitigate the impact of the pandemic at a local level. A prompt, supportive, and empathic collaboration between the Government, citizens, and health experts, along with international assistance, can enable the country to minimize the impact of the pandemic."

2188,Vaccines for COVID-19: Where do we stand in 2021?,"As of July 2021, over 3 billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally, and there are now 19 COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in at least one country. Several of these have been shown to be highly effective both in clinical trials and real-world observational studies, some of which have included special populations of interest. A small number of countries have approved a COVID-19 vaccine for use in adolescents or children. These are laudable achievements, but the global vaccination effort has been challenged by inequitable distribution of vaccines predominantly to high income countries, with only 0.9% of people in low-income countries having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Addressing this inequity is of critical importance and will result in better control of SARS-CoV-2 globally. Other challenges include: the reduced protection from COVID-19 vaccines against some strains of SARS-CoV-2, necessitating the development of variant specific vaccines; and uncertainties around the duration of protection from vaccine-induced immunity."
2189,Multiplexed Serum Antibody Screening Platform Using Virus Extracts from Endemic Coronaviridae and SARS-CoV-2.,"The presence of antibodies against endemic coronaviruses has been linked to disease severity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assays capable of concomitantly detecting antibodies against endemic coronaviridae such as OC43, 229E, NL63, and SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate this question. We developed a serum screening platform using a bead-based Western blot system called DigiWest, capable of running hundreds of assays using microgram amounts of protein prepared directly from different viruses. Characterization of the immunoassay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies revealed a sensitivity of 90.3% and a diagnostic specificity of 98.1%. Concordance analysis with the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays available by Roche, Siemens, and Euroimmun indicates comparable assay performances (Cohen's κ ranging from 0.8874 to 0.9508). Analogous assays for OC43, 229E, and NL63 were established and combined into one multiplex with the SARS-CoV-2 assay. Seroreactivity for different coronaviruses was detected with high incidence, and the multiplex assay was adapted for serum screening."
