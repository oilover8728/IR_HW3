4100,Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG after BNT162b2 vaccination.,"Deployment of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine in Israel began in December 2020. This is a retrospective analysis of serological data, showing SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG kinetics in 116 Israeli health care workers receiving BNT162b2. Sero-conversion occurred in 14 days in all study participants, with IgG levels peaking approximately 30 days after initiation of the vaccination series. A statistically significant difference was observed in IgG levels between subjects younger than 50 years and older participants, although in all cases, IgG levels were well above the level considered reactive by the test's manufacturer. The importance of this difference needs to be studied further, but a potential difference in vaccine efficacy and vaccine effect length could possibly be present between these two groups."

4102,"SARS-CoV-2 serology in 4000 health care and administrative staff across seven sites in Lombardy, Italy.","Lombardy is the Italian region most affected by COVID-19. We tested the presence of plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 3985 employees across 7 healthcare facilities in areas of Lombardy with different exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Subjects filled a questionnaire to self-report on COVID-19 symptoms, comorbidities, smoking, regular or remote working, and the exposure to COVID-infected individuals. We show that the number of individuals exposed to the virus depended on the geographical location of the facility, ranging between 3 and 43%, consistent with the spatial variation of COVID-19 incidence in Lombardy, and correlated with family interactions. We observed a higher prevalence of females than males positive for IgG, however the level of antibodies was similar, suggesting a comparable magnitude of the anti-spike antibody response. IgG positivity among smokers was lower (7.4% vs 13.5%) although without difference in IgG plasma levels. We observed 11.9% of IgG positive asymptomatic individuals and another 23.1% with one or two symptoms. Interestingly, among the IgG positive population, 81.2% of subjects with anosmia/dysgeusia and fever were SARS-CoV-2 infected, indicating that these symptoms are strongly associated to COVID-19. In conclusion, the frequency of IgG positivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the geographical exposure to the virus and primarily to family rather than hospital exposure."
4103,A new generation of vaccines based on alphavirus self-amplifying RNA.,"DNA or mRNA vaccines have potential advantages over conventional vaccines since they are easier to manufacture and have higher safety profiles. In particular, self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) derived from alphavirus expression vectors has shown to be very efficient to induce humoral and cellular responses against many antigens in preclinical models, being superior to non-replicating mRNA and DNA. This is mainly due to the fact that saRNA can provide very high expression levels and simultaneously induces strong innate responses, potentiating immunity. saRNA can be administered as viral particles or DNA, but direct delivery as RNA represents a safer and more simple approach. Although saRNA can be delivered as naked RNA, in vivo transfection can be enhanced by electroporation or by complexing it with cationic lipids or polymers. Alphavirus saRNA could have broad application to vaccinate against human pathogens, including emerging ones like SARS-CoV-2, for which clinical trials have been recently initiated."
4104,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Binding and Neutralizing Antibodies in Healthcare Workers during the Epidemic Peak in Referral Hospitals and Quarantine Sites: Saudi Arabia.,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population. Here, we aimed to evaluate and characterize the SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rate in randomly collected samples among HCWs from the largest referral hospitals and quarantine sites during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the city of Jeddah, the second largest city in Saudi Arabia, using a cross-sectional analytic study design. Out of 693 participants recruited from 29 June to 10 August 2020, 223 (32.2%, 95% CI: 28.8-35.8) were found to be confirmed seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and among those 197 (88.3%) had never been diagnosed with COVID-19. Seropositivity was not significantly associated with participants reporting COVID-19 compatible symptoms as most seropositive HCW participants 140 (62.8%) were asymptomatic. The large proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases detected in our study demands periodic testing as a general hospital policy."

4106,Association Between Race and COVID-19 Outcomes Among 2.6 Million Children in England.,"Importance: Although children mainly experience mild COVID-19 disease, hospitalization rates are increasing, with limited understanding of underlying factors. There is an established association between race and severe COVID-19 outcomes in adults in England; however, whether a similar association exists in children is unclear. Objective: To investigate the association between race and childhood COVID-19 testing and hospital outcomes. Design, setting, participants: In this cohort study, children (0-18 years of age) from participating family practices in England were identified in the QResearch database between January 24 and November 30, 2020. The QResearch database has individually linked patients with national SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital admission, and mortality data. Exposures: The main characteristic of interest is self-reported race. Other exposures were age, sex, deprivation level, geographic region, household size, and comorbidities (asthma; diabetes; and cardiac, neurologic, and hematologic conditions). Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was hospital admission with confirmed COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2-positive test result and any hospital attendance with confirmed COVID-19 and intensive care admission. Results: Of 2 576 353 children (mean [SD] age, 9.23 [5.24] years; 48.8% female), 410 726 (15.9%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 26 322 (6.4%) tested positive. A total of 1853 children (0.07%) with confirmed COVID-19 attended hospital, 343 (0.01%) were admitted to the hospital, and 73 (0.002%) required intensive care. Testing varied across race. White children had the highest proportion of SARS-CoV-2 tests (223 701/1 311 041 [17.1%]), whereas Asian children (33 213/243 545 [13.6%]), Black children (7727/93 620 [8.3%]), and children of mixed or other races (18 971/147 529 [12.9%]) had lower proportions. Compared with White children, Asian children were more likely to have COVID-19 hospital admissions (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.12-2.36), whereas Black children (adjusted OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.90-2.31) and children of mixed or other races (adjusted OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.93-2.10) had comparable hospital admissions. Asian children were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (adjusted OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.07-4.14), and Black children (adjusted OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.08-4.94) and children of mixed or other races (adjusted OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.25-3.65) had longer hospital admissions (≥36 hours). Conclusions and relevance: In this large population-based study exploring the association between race and childhood COVID-19 testing and hospital outcomes, several race-specific disparities were observed in severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, ascertainment bias and residual confounding in this cohort study should be considered before drawing any further conclusions. Overall, findings of this study have important public health implications internationally."
4107,"SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 UK Variant of Concern Lineage-Related Perceptions, COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Travel Worry Among Healthcare Workers.","Background: Healthcare workers' (HCWs') travel-related anxiety needs to be assessed in light of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Methods: An online, cross-sectional questionnaire among HCWs between December 21, 2020 to January 7, 2021. The outcome variables were HCWs' knowledge and awareness of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage that was recently reported as the UK variant of concern, and its associated travel worry and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. Results: A total of 1,058 HCWs completed the survey; 66.5% were female, 59.0% were nurses. 9.0% indicated they had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. Regarding the B.1.1.7 lineage, almost all (97.3%) were aware of its emergence, 73.8% were aware that it is more infectious, 78.0% thought it causes more severe disease, and only 50.0% knew that current COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing it. Despite this, 66.7% of HCWs were not registered to receive the vaccine. HCWs' most common source of information about the new variant was social media platforms (67.0%), and this subgroup was significantly more worried about traveling. Nurses were more worried than physicians (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Most HCWs were aware of the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and expressed substantial travel worries. Increased worry levels were found among HCWs who used social media as their main source of information, those with lower levels of COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and those with higher GAD-7 scores. The utilization of official social media platforms could improve accurate information dissemination among HCWs regarding the Pandemic's evolving mutations. Targeted vaccine campaigns are warranted to assure HCWs about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines toward SARS-CoV-2 variants."
4108,Voltammetric-based immunosensor for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen.,"Since the COVID-19 disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) was declared a pandemic, it has spread rapidly, causing one of the most serious outbreaks in the last century. Reliable and rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are crucial to control and manage the outbreak. Here, a label-free square wave voltammetry-based biosensing platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples is reported. The sensor was constructed on screen-printed carbon electrodes coated with gold nanoparticles. The electrodes were functionalized using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) which was used for the immobilization of an antibody against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein). The binding of the immunosensor with the N protein caused a change in the electrochemical signal. The detection was realised by measuring the change in reduction peak current of a redox couple using square wave voltammetry at 0.04 V versus Ag ref. electrode on the immunosensor upon binding with the N protein. The electrochemical immunosensor showed high sensitivity with a linear range from 1.0 pg.mL-1 to 100 ng.mL-1 and a limit of detection of 0.4 pg.mL-1 for the N protein in PBS buffer pH 7.4. Moreover, the immunosensor did not exhibit significant response with other viruses such as HCoV, MERS-CoV, Flu A and Flu B, indicating the high selectivity of the sensor for SARS-CoV-2. However, cross reactivity of the biosensor with SARS-CoV is indicated, which gives ability of the sensor to detect both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The biosensor was successfully applied to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical samples showing good correlation between the biosensor response and the RT-PCR cycle threshold values. We believe that the capability of miniaturization, low-cost and fast response of the proposed label-free electrochemical immunosensor will facilitate the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID 19 and help prevent further spread of infection."
