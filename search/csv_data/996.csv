9950,The effect of favipiravir on QTc interval in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019.,"Background: The effect of favipiravir on the QTc interval during the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is unclear. Thus, the current study objective was to evaluate any change in the QTc interval in patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 receiving favipiravir treatment. Method: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were assessed in this single-center retrospective study. 189 patients, whose diagnosis was confirmed using real-time PCR, were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups: those using hydroxychloroquine (Group 1, n = 66), hydroxychloroquine plus favipiravir (Group 2, n = 66), and favipiravir only (Group 3, n = 57). The QTc interval was measured before treatment (QTc-B) and 48 h after (i.e., the median) starting treatment (QTc-AT). Results: The median age was 53 (39-66 IQR) and 97 (51%) of patients were female. The median QTc(Bazett)-change was 7 ms (p = 0.028) and 12 ms (p < 0.001) and in Group 1 and 2, respectively. In Group 3, the median QTc(Bazett)-change was observed as -3 ms and was not statistically significant (p = 0.247). In multivariable analysis, while there was a significant relationship between QTc-AT(Bazett) and hydroxychloroquine (β coefficient = 2687, 95%CI 2599-16,976, p = 0,008), there was no significant relationship with favipiravir (β coefficient = 0,180, 95% CI -6435-7724, p = 0,858). Similarly, there was a significant relationship between the QTc-AT interval calculated using the Fredericia formula and hydroxychloroquine (β coefficient = 2120, 95% CI 0,514-14,398, p = 0,035), but not with favipiravir (β coefficient = 0,111, 95% CI -6450- 7221, p = 0,911). Conclusion: In the ECG recordings received in the following days after the treatment was started in COVID-19 patients, there was a significant prolongation in the QTc interval with hydroxychloroquine, but there was no significant change with favipiravir."
9951,Dysregulation of Cell Signaling by SARS-CoV-2.,"Pathogens usurp host pathways to generate a permissive environment for their propagation. The current spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presents the urgent need to understand the complex pathogen-host interplay for effective control of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 reorganizes the host cytoskeleton for efficient cell entry and controls host transcriptional processes to support viral protein translation. The virus also dysregulates innate cellular defenses using various structural and nonstructural proteins. This results in substantial but delayed hyperinflammation alongside a weakened interferon (IFN) response. We provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 and its uniquely aggressive life cycle and discuss the interactions of various viral proteins with host signaling pathways. We also address the functional changes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, relative to SARS-CoV. Our comprehensive assessment of host signaling in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis provides some complex yet important strategic clues for the development of novel therapeutics against this rapidly emerging worldwide crisis."
9952,Viewpoint of a WHO Advisory Group Tasked to Consider Establishing a Closely-monitored Challenge Model of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthy Volunteers.,"WHO convened an Advisory Group (AG) to consider the feasibility, potential value, and limitations of establishing a closely-monitored challenge model of experimental severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthy adult volunteers. The AG included experts in design, establishment, and performance of challenges. This report summarizes issues that render a COVID-19 model daunting to establish (the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to cause severe/fatal illness, its high transmissibility, and lack of a ""rescue treatment"" to prevent progression from mild/moderate to severe clinical illness) and it proffers prudent strategies for stepwise model development, challenge virus selection, guidelines for manufacturing challenge doses, and ways to contain SARS-CoV-2 and prevent transmission to household/community contacts. A COVID-19 model could demonstrate protection against virus shedding and/or illness induced by prior SARS-CoV-2 challenge or vaccination. A limitation of the model is that vaccine efficacy in experimentally challenged healthy young adults cannot per se be extrapolated to predict efficacy in elderly/high-risk adults."
9953,Wildland firefighter exposure to smoke and COVID-19: A new risk on the fire line.,"Throughout the United States, wildland firefighters respond to wildfires, performing arduous work in remote locations. Wildfire incidents can be an ideal environment for the transmission of infectious diseases, particularly for wildland firefighters who congregate in work and living settings. In this review, we examine how exposure to wildfire smoke can contribute to an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Human exposure to particulate matter (PM), a component of wildfire smoke, has been associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory responses; increasing the likelihood for adverse respiratory symptomology and pathology. In multiple epidemiological studies, wildfire smoke exposure has been associated with acute lower respiratory infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Co-occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and wildfire smoke inhalation may present an increased risk for COVID-19 illness in wildland firefighters due to PM based transport of SARS CoV-2 virus and up-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-2) (i.e. ACE-2 functions as a trans-membrane receptor, allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to gain entry into the epithelial cell). Wildfire smoke exposure may also increase risk for more severe COVID-19 illness such as cytokine release syndrome, hypotension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current infection control measures, including social distancing, wearing cloth masks, frequent cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, frequent hand washing, and daily screening for COVID-19 symptoms are very important measures to reduce infections and severe health outcomes. Exposure to wildfire smoke may introduce additive or even multiplicative risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of disease in wildland firefighters. Thus, additional mitigative measures may be needed to prevent the co-occurrence of wildfire smoke exposure and SARS-CoV-2 infection."

The aim is to provide evidence-based recommendations defining the risks of COVID-19 in clinic, the importance of pre-visit screening in addition to testing, along with ways to adhere to CDC guidelines for environmental, source, and engineering controls."
9956,Documenting COVID-19 screening before surgery during lockdown (COVID Screen): an audit with routinely collected health data.,"Objective This study analysed screening for COVID-19 before surgery and outcomes of any perioperative testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection during pandemic-restricted surgery. Methods An audit was conducted with routinely collected health data before both elective and non-elective surgery at two large Melbourne hospitals during April and early May 2020. We looked for documented systematic screening for COVID-19 disease and fever (>38°C) and results of SARS-COV-2 testing, and proposed a minimum acceptable documenting rate of 85%. Results The study included 2197 consecutive patients (1279 (58%) undergoing elective surgery, 917 (42%) undergoing non-elective surgery) across most specialities. Although 926 (72%) patients undergoing elective surgery had both systematic screening and temperature documented, approximately half that percentage undergoing non-elective surgery (n=347; 38%) had both documented. However, 871 (95%) of non-elective surgery patients had temperature documented. Acknowledging limited screening, 85 (9.3%) non-elective surgery patients had positive screening, compared with 39 (3.0%) elective surgery patients. All 152 (7%) patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and no cases were reported from external contact tracing. Conclusions Although 'not documented' does not necessarily equal 'not done', we found that documenting of COVID-19 screening could be improved. Better understanding of implementing screening practices in pandemics and other crises, particularly for non-elective surgery patients, is warranted. What is known about the topic? Little is known about routine screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection among surgical patients. However, it is well established that implementing effective uptake of safety and quality initiatives can be difficult. What does this paper add? We found that although most patients had documented temperature, fewer than 75% had a documented systematic questionnaire screen for COVID, particularly patients undergoing non-elective surgery. What are the implications for practitioners? Clear documenting is important in managing patients. Pandemics and other crises can require rapid changes in practice. Implementing such measures may be less complete than anticipated and may require greater use of evidence-based implementation strategies, particularly in the less predictable care of non-elective surgery patients."
9957,Experimental characterization of speech aerosol dispersion dynamics.,"Contact and inhalation of virions-carrying human aerosols represent the primary transmission pathway for airborne diseases including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Relative to sneezing and coughing, non-symptomatic aerosol-producing activities such as speaking are highly understudied. The dispersions of aerosols from vocalization by a human subject are hereby quantified using high-speed particle image velocimetry. Syllables of different aerosol production rates were tested and compared to coughing. Results indicate aerosol productions and penetrations are not correlated. E.g. 'ti' and 'ma' have similar production rates but only 'ti' penetrated as far as coughs. All cases exhibited a rapidly penetrating ""jet phase"" followed by a slow ""puff phase."" Immediate dilution of aerosols was prevented by vortex ring flow structures that concentrated particles toward the plume-front. A high-fidelity assessment of risks to exposure must account for aerosol production rate, penetration, plume direction and the prevailing air current."

9959,Comparison analysis of different swabs and transport mediums suitable for SARS-CoV-2 testing following shortages.,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) assessed COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, as a pandemic. As of June 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has had a documented effect of over 6 million cases world-wide, amounting to over 370,000 deaths (World Health Organization, 2020. Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Situation. http://https://covid19.who.int/). Consequently, the high demand for testing has resulted in a depletion of commercially available consumables, including the recommended swabs and viral transport media (VTM) required for nasopharyngeal sampling. Therefore, the potential use of unvalidated alternatives must be explored to address the global shortage of testing supplies. To tackle this issue, we evaluated the utility of different swabs and transport mediums for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. This study compared the performance of six swabs commonly found in primary and tertiary health care settings (PurFlock Ultra, FLOQSwab, Puritan Pur-Wraps cotton tipped applicators, Puritan polyester tipped applicators, MedPro 6"" cotton tipped applicators, and HOLOGIC Aptima) for their efficacy in testing for SARS-CoV-2. Separately, the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 was completed from different transport mediums (DMEM, PBS, 100 % ethanol, 0.9 % normal saline and VTM), which were kept up to three days at room temperature (RT). The results indicate that there is no meaningful difference in viral yield from different swabs and most transport mediums for the collection and detection of SARS-CoV-2, indicating swab and medium alternatives could be used if supplies run out."
