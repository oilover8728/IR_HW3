1750,Could live attenuated vaccines better control COVID-19?,"In an effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic, large-scale vaccination is being implemented in various countries using anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on mRNAs, adenovirus vectors, and inactivated viruses. However, there are concerns regarding adverse effects, such as the induction of fever attributed to mRNA vaccines and pre-existing immunity against adenovirus vectored vaccines or their possible involvement in the development of thrombosis. The induction of antibodies against the adenovirus vector itself constitutes another hindrance, rendering boosting vaccinations ineffective. Additionally, it has been questioned whether inactivated vaccines that predominantly induce humoral immunity are effective against newly arising variants, as some isolated strains were found to be resistant to the serum from COVID-19-recovered patients. Although the number of vaccinated people is steadily increasing on a global scale, it is still necessary to develop vaccines to address the difficulties and concerns mentioned above. Among the various vaccine modalities, live attenuated vaccines have been considered the most effective, since they closely replicate a natural infection without the burden of the disease. In our attempt to provide an additional option to the repertoire of COVID-19 vaccines, we succeeded in isolating temperature-sensitive strains with unique phenotypes that could serve as seeds for a live attenuated vaccine. In this review article, we summarize the characteristics of the currently approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, we focus on the novel temperature-sensitive variants of SARS-CoV-2 that we have recently isolated, and their potential application as live-attenuated vaccines. Based on a thorough evaluation of the different vaccine modalities, we argue that it is important to optimize usage not only based on efficacy, but also on the phases of the pandemic. Our findings can be used to inform vaccination practices and improve global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic."
1751,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Survey Estimates Are Affected by Anti-Nucleocapsid Antibody Decline.,"We analyzed 21 676 residual specimens from Ontario, Canada collected March-August 2020 to investigate the effect of antibody decline on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates. Testing specimens orthogonally using Abbott (anti-nucleocapsid) and Ortho (anti-spike) assays, seroprevalence estimates were 0.4%-1.4%, despite ongoing disease activity. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of antibody-positive specimens decreased over time (P = .015), and GMC of antibody-negative specimens increased over time (P = .0018). Association between the 2 tests decreased each month (P < .001), suggesting anti-nucleocapsid antibody decline. Lowering Abbott antibody index cutoff from 1.4 to 0.7 resulted in a 16% increase in positive specimens."

1753,The Need for a Practical Approach to Evaluate the Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines for Low- and Middle-Income Countries.,"The global demand for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines currently far outweighs the available global supply and manufacturing capacity. As a result, securing doses of vaccines for low- and middle-income countries has been challenging, particularly for African countries. Clinical trial investigation for COVID-19 vaccines has been rare in Africa, with the only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for COVID-19 vaccines having been conducted in South Africa. In addition to addressing the current inequities in the vaccine roll-out for low- and middle-income countries, there is a need to monitor the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in these regions. Although RCTs are the superior method for evaluating vaccine efficacy, the feasibility of conducting RCTs to monitor COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness during mass vaccine campaigns will likely be low. There is still a need to evaluate the effectiveness of mass COVID-19 vaccine distribution in a practical manner. We discuss how target trial emulation, the application of trial design principles from RCTs to the analysis of observational data, can be used as a practical, cost-effective way to evaluate real-world effectiveness for COVID-19 vaccines. There are several study design considerations that need to be made in the analyses of observational data, such as uncontrolled confounders and selection biases. Target trial emulation accounts for these considerations to improve the analyses of observational data. The framework of target trial emulation provides a practical way to monitor the effectiveness of mass vaccine campaigns for COVID-19 using observational data."
1754,Evaluation of a Surrogate Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay-Based Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cPass Neutralization Antibody Detection Assay and Correlation With Immunoglobulin G Commercial Serology Assays.,"Context.—: Emerging evidence shows correlation between the presence of neutralization antibodies (nAbs) and protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently available commercial serology assays lack the ability to specifically identify nAbs. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based nAb assay (GenScript cPass neutralization antibody assay) has recently received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Objective.—: To evaluate the performance characteristics of this assay and compare and correlate it with the commercial assays that detect SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG). Design.—: Specimens from SARS-COV-2 infected patients (n = 124), healthy donors obtained prepandemic (n = 100), and patients with non-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory infections (n = 92) were analyzed using this assay. Samples with residual volume were also tested on 3 commercial serology platforms (Abbott, Euroimmun, Siemens). Twenty-eight randomly selected specimens from patients with COVID-19 and 10 healthy controls were subjected to a plaque reduction neutralization test. Results.—: The cPass assay exhibited 96.1% (95% CI, 94.9%-97.3%) sensitivity (at >14 days post-positive PCR), 100% (95% CI, 98.0%-100.0%) specificity, and zero cross-reactivity for the presence of non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. When compared with the plaque reduction assay, 97.4% (95% CI, 96.2%-98.5%) qualitative agreement and a positive correlation (R2 = 0.76) was observed. Comparison of IgG signals from each of the commercial assays with the nAb results from plaque reduction neutralization test/cPass assays displayed greater than 94.7% qualitative agreement and correlations with R2 = 0.43/0.68 (Abbott), R2 = 0.57/0.85 (Euroimmun), and R2 = 0.39/0.63 (Siemens), respectively. Conclusions.—: The combined data support the use of cPass assay for accurate detection of the nAb response. Positive IgG results from commercial assays associated reasonably with nAbs presence and can serve as a substitute."
1755,"Highly Sensitive and Specific Multiplex Antibody Assays To Quantify Immunoglobulins M, A, and G against SARS-CoV-2 Antigens.","Reliable serological tests are required to determine the prevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to characterize immunity to the disease in order to address key knowledge gaps in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Quantitative suspension array technology (qSAT) assays based on the xMAP Luminex platform overcome the limitations of rapid diagnostic tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with their higher precision, dynamic range, throughput, miniaturization, cost-efficiency, and multiplexing capacity. We developed three qSAT assays for IgM, IgA, and IgG against a panel of eight SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), and membrane protein (M) constructs. The assays were optimized to minimize the processing time and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. We evaluated their performances using 128 prepandemic plasma samples (negative controls) and 104 plasma samples from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive controls), of whom 5 were asymptomatic, 51 had mild symptoms, and 48 were hospitalized. Preexisting IgG antibodies recognizing N, M, and S proteins were detected in negative controls, which is suggestive of cross-reactivity to common-cold coronaviruses. The best-performing antibody/antigen signatures had specificities of 100% and sensitivities of 95.78% at ≥14 days and 95.65% at ≥21 days since the onset of symptoms, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.977 and 0.999, respectively. Combining multiple markers as assessed by qSAT assays has the highest efficiency, breadth, and versatility to accurately detect low-level antibody responses for obtaining reliable data on the prevalence of exposure to novel pathogens in a population. Our assays will allow gaining insights into antibody correlates of immunity and their kinetics, required for vaccine development to combat the COVID-19 pandemic."

1757,The BCG Vaccine for COVID-19: First Verdict and Future Directions.,"Despite of the rapid development of the vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it will take several months to have enough doses and the proper infrastructure to vaccinate a good proportion of the world population. In this interim, the accessibility to the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) may mitigate the pandemic impact in some countries and the BCG vaccine offers significant advantages and flexibility in the way clinical vaccines are administered. BCG vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against tuberculosis (TB) and many low-and lower-middle-income countries would likely have the infrastructure, and health care personnel sufficiently familiar with the conventional TB vaccine to mount full-scale efforts to administer novel BCG-based vaccine for COVID-19. This suggests the potential for BCG to overcome future barriers to vaccine roll-out in the countries where health systems are fragile and where the effects of this new coronavirus could be catastrophic. Many studies have reported cross-protective effects of the BCG vaccine toward non-tuberculosis related diseases. Mechanistically, this cross-protective effect of the BCG vaccine can be explained, in part, by trained immunity, a recently discovered program of innate immune memory, which is characterized by non-permanent epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages that leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production and consequently potent immune responses. In this review, we summarize recent work highlighting the potential use of BCG for the treatment respiratory infectious diseases and ongoing SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials. In situations where no other specific prophylactic tools are available, the BCG vaccine could be used as a potential adjuvant, to decrease sickness of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or to mitigate the effects of concurrent respiratory infections."
1758,SARS-CoV-2-mediated immune system activation and potential application in immunotherapy.,"Although novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-mediated pulmonary inflammation has recently attracted great attention, its pathology and pathogenesis are not clear. Notably, due to both its high infective and pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause a severe sometimes fatal respiratory disease. A specific vaccine, which relies on the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 structural protein-derived antigenic peptides, is indispensable for restraining the spread and reducing the mortality of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infections activate cytototxic, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, as well as natural killer, B, helper T, and regulatory T cells, thus further stimulating innate and antigen-specific immune responses. Nevertheless, many immune effector cells cause hyperinflammation and pulmonary immunopathology by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, MIP1B, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-18, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, and induced protein 10. Interestingly, related products derived from SARS-CoV-2 are likely to trigger immune evasion. Therefore, investigating SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines, blocking immunopathology, and prohibiting immune evasion are urgently required for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we emphatically illuminated the development of a SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccine based on the analysis of epitopes, also expounding the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Furthermore, we comprehensively discussed SARS-CoV-2-associated immune evasion and lung immunopathology. Lastly, potential therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 were explored."
1759,Development and characterization of an indirect ELISA to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies.,"The current Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern. Sensitive and precise diagnostic tools are urgently needed. In this study, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The SARS-CoV-2 S1 ELISA was found to be specific [97.8% (95% CI, 96.7% - 98.5%)], reproducible and precise (intra-assay coefficient of variability (CV) 5.3%, inter-assay CV 7.9%). A standard curve and the interpolation of arbitrary ELISA units per milliliter served to reduce the variability between different tests and operators. Cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses was addressed by using sera positive for MERS-CoV- and hCoV HKU1-specific antibodies. Monitoring antibody development in various samples of twenty-three and single samples of twenty-nine coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients revealed seroconversion and neutralizing antibodies against authentic SARS-CoV-2 in all cases. The comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 (S1) ELISA with a commercially available assay showed a better sensitivity for the in-house ELISA. The results demonstrate a high reproducibility, specificity and sensitivity of the newly developed ELISA, which is suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein-specific antibody responses."
