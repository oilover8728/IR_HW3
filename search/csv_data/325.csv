3242,Optimizing RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 for developing countries using pool testing.,"The global shortage of reagents and kits for nucleic acid extraction and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 requires new cost-effective strategies for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases, especially in countries that need to increase detection capacity. Pooled nucleic acid testing has been extensively used as a cost-effective strategy for HIV, HepB, HepC and influenza. Also, protocols dispensing of RNA extraction appears as an attractive option for detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we found that pooling of 5 samples showed that CT variations were in the range of 1.0-4,5 units, with less likelihood of a false negative result. Results of the sample without nucleic acid ex-traction, was unsatisfactory, with a significant increase in CT values, and thus for risk of a false negative result. In conclusion, pooling nasopharyngeal samples with both automated and manual extraction proved reliable, and thus a potential efficient alternative for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in developing countries."
3243,A Structural Landscape of Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain.,"SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has been spreading rampantly. The global scientific community has responded rapidly to understand immune correlates of protection to develop vaccines and immunotherapeutics against the virus. The major goal of this mini review is to summarize current understanding of the structural landscape of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral spike (S) glycoprotein. The RBD plays a critical role in the very first step of the virus life cycle. Better understanding of where and how nAbs bind the RBD should enable identification of sites of vulnerability and facilitate better vaccine design and formulation of immunotherapeutics. Towards this goal, we compiled 38 RBD-binding nAbs with known structures. Review of these nAb structures showed that (1) nAbs can be divided into five general clusters, (2) there are distinct non-neutralizing faces on the RBD, and (3) maximum of potentially four nAbs could bind the RBD simultaneously. Since most of these nAbs were isolated from virus-infected patients, additional analyses of vaccine-induced nAbs could facilitate development of improved vaccines."
3244,B-cell engineering: A promising approach towards vaccine development for COVID-19.,"With the number of cases crossing six million (and more than three hundred and seventy thousand deaths) worldwide, there is a dire need of a vaccine (and repurposing of drugs) for SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). It can be argued that a vaccine may be the most efficient way to contain the spread of this disease and prevent its future onset. While many attempts are being made to design and develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, pertinent technological hitches do exist. That is perhaps one of the reasons that we don't have vaccine for coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS). Recently developed CRISPR-mediated genome editing approach can be repurposed into a cell-modification endeavor in addition to (and rather than) correcting defective parts of genome. With this premise, B-cells can be engineered into universal donor, antigen specific, perpetually viable, long lasting, non-oncogenic, relatively benign, antibody producing cells which may serve as an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and, by the same rationale, other viruses and pathogens."

Moreover, if some variants of concern have increased transmissibility or virulence, the importance of efficient public health measures and vaccination programs will increase. The global response must be both timely and science based."
3249,Hemorrhagic stroke associated to COVID-19 infection in Mexico General Hospital.,"Introducción: en la actual pandemia de COVID-19, existe evidencia creciente que ha identificado el neurotropismo del virus SARS-CoV-2 y sus complicaciones neurológicas, incluida la enfermedad cerebrovascular isquémica y escasamente hemorragia cerebral (HC). Objetivo: describir las características clínicas, radiológicas, de laboratorio y pronósticas de los pacientes con HC asociada al SARS-CoV-2. Métodos: se incluyeron pacientes consecutivos con prueba de PCR confirmatoria para infección por SARS-CoV-2 y HC. Resultados: en un período de 90 días, en un centro de referencia COVID-19 en México, de 1108 pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2, se encontraron 4 pacientes (0.36%) con HC. Tenían una edad de 71(±12.2) años, 2 eran mujeres. Se encontró que dos tenían factores de riesgo cardiovascular previos. En dos casos se encontró el origen en el núcleo dentado mientras que los otros dos correspondieron al tálamo. Tres de los cuatro pacientes murieron. Postulamos que el descontrol hipertensivo, coagulopatía, trombocitopenia y la respuesta inmune inducida por el virus SARS-CoV-2 podrían desencadenar HC en un paciente con riesgo previo. Conclusiones: la HC se asocia a la infección por SARS-CoV-2 con mal pronóstico cuando se presenta. Los equipos de neurocirugía deben estar preparados para el tratamiento oportuno de estos pacientes. Introduction: In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing body of evidence that has identified the neurotropism of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its neurological complications, including cerebrovascular disease, focusing mainly in ischemic and scarcely about hemorrhagic stroke (HS). Objective: The objective of the study was to describe clinical, radiological, laboratory tests, and prognostic characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated HS. Methods: Consecutive patients with a confirmatory PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and a HS demonstrated by head CT were included in the study. Results: Over a period of 90 days, in a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico, out of a total of 1108 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, it found 4 patients (0.36%) who meet criteria. They had an age of 71 (±12.2) years, 2 were women. It was found that two had prior cardiovascular risk factors. Two of the HS originated in the dentate nucleus while the other two corresponded to the thalamus. Three of the four patients died. We suggest that catastrophic uncontrolled blood pressure, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 could in a specific patient trigger HS. Conclusions: HS is associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection with poor prognosis when it presented. Neurosurgery teams should prepare for the timely and appropriate treatment of this patients."
