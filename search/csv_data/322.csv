3210,Cardiovascular Complication following Covishield Vaccination in Nepal: A Case Report.,"Nepal started the COVID-19 vaccination on 27 January 2021 with AstraZeneca/Oxford Coronavirus Disease-19 AZD1222 (Covishield) vaccine to control the Coronavirus disease pandemic. The vaccine has a good safety profile, with cardiovascular complications being rare. Herein we report a rare case of cardiovascular complication following Covishield vaccination in a 33 years old female who had dizziness and elevated blood pressure immediately following vaccination and abnormal electrocardiogram showing T wave inversions followed by left bundle branch block. The patient was kept on observation, following which the blood pressure and electrocardiogram changes were normal by seven days. This cardiovascular complication following the vaccination demands further investigation into the adverse event of the vaccine. However, since the benefit of the vaccine outweighs the risk, World Health Organization has recommended the continuity of the vaccine as of now."

3212,"Atypical symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 test results and immunisation rates in 456 residents from eight nursing homes facing a COVID-19 outbreak.","Background: Frail older persons may have an atypical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The value of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nursing homes (NHs) residents is not known. Objective: To determine whether (i) atypical symptoms may predict rRT-PCR results and (ii) rRT-PCR results may predict immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 in NH residents. Design: A retrospective longitudinal study. Setting: Eight NHs with at least 10 rRT-PCR-positive residents. Subjects: A total of 456 residents. Methods: Typical and atypical symptoms recorded in residents' files during the 14 days before and after rRT-PCR testing were analysed. Residents underwent blood testing for IgG-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 6 to 8 weeks after testing. Univariate and multivariate analyses compared symptoms and immunisation rates in rRT-PCR-positive and negative residents. Results: A total of 161 residents had a positive rRT-PCR (35.3%), 17.4% of whom were asymptomatic before testing. Temperature >37.8°C, oxygen saturation <90%, unexplained anorexia, behavioural change, exhaustion, malaise and falls before testing were independent predictors of a further positive rRT-PCR. Among the rRT-PCR-positive residents, 95.2% developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies vs 7.6% in the rRT-PCR-negative residents. Among the residents with a negative rRT-PCR, those who developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies more often had typical or atypical symptoms (P = 0.02 and <0.01, respectively). Conclusion: This study supports a strategy based on (i) testing residents with typical or unexplained atypical symptoms for an early identification of the first SARS-CoV-2 cases, (ii) rT-PCR testing for identifying COVID-19 residents, (iii) repeated wide-facility testing (including asymptomatic cases) as soon as a resident is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and (iv) implementing SARS-CoV-2 infection control measures in rRT-PCR-negative residents when they have unexplained typical or atypical symptoms."
3213,"Perinatology clinic in the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic: what harms, often teaches.","Background: Compartmental models simplify the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases based on reported cases. In the absence of precautions, personal protective equipment, quarantine and social distancing, a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SuEIR) model with Unscented Kalman Filter for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) Forecasts in Turkey has revealed 174 641 infected people on August 15, 2020, whilst the reported case was 12 216. Through numerical experiments, the effects of quarantine, social distancing, and COVID-19 testing on the dynamics of the outbreak varies. We herein present the documentation of the work in a perinatology clinic during COVID-19 pandemic to find the reflection in a pandemic hospital as even in the pandemic, pregnancy complications and fetal diagnosis/therapy are time-sensitive and cannot be delayed. During the prevention of the horizontal transmission to the health-care workers (HCWs), testing all pregnant women with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) undergoing birth, ultrasound examinations, invasive procedures appear to be the gold standard so that appropriate precautions can be taken if the screen is positive. Though it is logical, it may be incompatible with a busy obstetric practise as a pending polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result should never delay any emergent procedure. Objective: We aim to describe the development of COVID-19 disease of 408 HCW out of 1462 by the exposure to pregnant women while providing obstetric care in a single tertiary perinatology unit under strict clinical triage, recommended precautions and wearing personal protective equipment and compare the maternal and perinatal outcome with those of the preceding three months. Study design: A prospective cohort study involving the pregnant women and the HCW with positive PCR for SARS-COV-2 were carried out to correlate with the horizontal transmission while documenting the perinatal work. Results: 25 HCW, including nurses/midwives: 11, doctors: 7 and health technicians: 3 and support staff: 4 developed positive PCR for SARS-COV-2 while providing healthcare to 162 cases: mild-moderate (n = 146), severe (n = 12) and critical (n = 1) and asymptomatic (n = 3) in obstetric population. 22 out of 25 HCW were working in the perinatology unit. COVID-19 clinic was asymptomatic (n = 8), mild-moderate (13) or severe (n = 2) in HCW. However, ""Exposed"" group in the SuEIR model, both the pregnant women and the HCW that have already been infected and have not been tested, which have been also capable of infecting the ""Susceptible"" group could not be determined. Some of the HCW and the pregnant women in the ""Exposed"" group were tested and transferred to the ""Infectious"" group (which were reported to be PCR positive), while the rest of them who recovered, transitted to the so-called ""Unreported Recovered"" group. The ratio of the women with severe pre-eclampsia admitted to intensive care unit increased significantly during the lockdown (p = .01). Conclusions: In a nonstop pandemic perinatology clinic, exposure to 162 PCR positive pregnant women may be correlated with a 5.4% (22/408) documented horizontal transmission in the frontline HCW despite clinical triage and personal protective equipment."
3214,Dental students' attitudes and hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccine.,"Background: Dentists are a group of providers who have been identified by CDC at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 through their contact with patients. This would apply to dental students as well. Thus, it is important to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination rates in this group. Further, as healthcare providers, they are entrusted with providing health recommendations and advocating for their patients, community, and profession, including vaccinations. Methods: Using ualtricsXM an online platform, in 2020, a survey was administered anonymously to dental students at three dental schools to assess the attitudes of dental students to the novel COVID-19 vaccine. Factors and reasons associated with vaccine hesitancy and acceptance toward the COVID-19 vaccine and likelihood of recommending and giving the vaccination to patients were assessed. Results: Nearly, all participants had positive attitudes toward vaccines in general, agreed they would likely be exposed to COVID-19, and personally knew someone who had COVID-19; however, only 56% are willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as an FDA-approved vaccine was available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine, 63% reported they would take it if mandated by the health systems/dental school; however, 16.3% of the overall respondents would not take the COVID-19 vaccine even if mandated. Several factors are associated with vaccine acceptance and the likelihood of recommending the vaccination, such as trusting public health experts, concerns about side effects, and agreeing with vaccine mandates. Conclusion: Our results highlight the need for an educational curriculum about the safety and effectiveness to promote the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine."
3215,Coronavirus testing in women attending antenatal care.,"Background: Universal screening has been proposed as a strategy to identify asymptomatic individuals infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mitigate transmission. Aim: To investigate the rate of positive tests among pregnant women in Melbourne, Australia. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional prevalence study at three maternity hospitals (one tertiary referral hospital and two secondary maternities) in Melbourne, Australia. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered to all pregnant women attending face-to-face antenatal visits and to those attending the hospital with symptoms of possible coronavirus disease, between 6th and 19th of May 2020. Testing was performed by multiplex-tandem polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs. The primary outcome was the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. Findings: SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in 350 women, of whom 19 had symptoms of possible COVID-19. The median maternal age was 32 years (IQR 28-35 years), and the median gestational age at testing was 33 weeks and four days (IQR 28 weeks to 36 weeks and two days). All 350 tests returned negative results (p̂=0%, 95% CI 0-1.0%). Conclusion: In a two-week period of low disease prevalence, the rate of asymptomatic coronavirus infection among pregnant women in Australia during the study period was negligible, reflecting low levels of community transmission."
3216,COVID-19 Vaccine and Fitness to Fly.,"INTRODUCTION: On December 2020 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This new vaccine has several side effects that can potentially impair function, which warrants special attention regarding aircrews fitness to fly following vaccination.METHODS: A survey was conducted in the Israeli Air Force (IAF) Aeromedical Center in order to characterize the side effects and their duration following Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine administration to aviators.RESULTS: The most common side effect was injection site pain. Headache, chills, myalgia, fatigue, and weakness were more common following the second dose administration. The difference is statistically significant. Following the second vaccine, duration of side effects was longer compared to the first vaccine (P-value 0.002).CONCLUSION: The IAF Aeromedical center policy for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine recipients among aircrew members, based on side effects duration and severity, is to temporarily ground from flight duties for 24 and 48 h following the first and the second dose, respectively.Gabbai D, Ekshtein A, Tehori O, Ben-Ari O, Shapira S.

3218,Abdominal Surgery in Patients With COVID-19: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Abdominal and Adipose Tissues.,"Multiple tissue samples were obtained during emergent abdominal surgery in 4 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to examine for tissue involvement by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder empyema and died from severe respiratory failure. The second patient with Crohn disease underwent emergent laparotomy for a perforation in the terminal ileum and recovered. The third patient underwent an open appendectomy and recovered. The fourth patient underwent emergent laparotomy for a perforated peptic ulcer and died from sepsis. Although the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the feces of 3 patients and in the duodenal wall of the patient with perforated peptic ulcer, real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examination of abdominal fluid was negative for the virus. The RT-PCR did not detect viral RNA in the wall of small intestine, appendix, gallbladder, bile, liver, and urine. Visceral fat (omentum) and abdominal subcutaneous fat of 4 patients were also not infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Although this limited experience did not show direct involvement of abdominal fluid and omentum, assessment in large series is suggested to provide answers about the safety of abdominal surgery in patients with COVID-19."
3219,Do we have serological evidences that chilblain-like lesions are related to SARS-CoV-2? A review of the literature.,"The outbreak of chilblain-like lesions (CLL) coincidentally to the COVID-19 pandemic is a topic of great concern. SARS-CoV-2 was initially hypothesized as the etiologic agent of CLL, but, since nasopharyngeal swabs seldom resulted positive, dermatologists' attention focused on the search for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Many papers were published contemporarily on this topic, reporting limited case series. We reviewed the English literature up to the first July 2020 and, excluding single case reports, we considered 13 studies that serologically investigated 220 patients. The presence of specific antibodies was detected in 18 subjects (8.2%): isolated IgA were found in 6 patients, IgA and IgG in 1, isolated IgG in 5, and IgM in 2. In 4 patients, isotypes were not specified. Our review demonstrated a high prevalence of negative serological results in CLL: antibodies were observed only in a few patients, that are even less excluding those with positive IgA, not clearly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. In conclusion, although it is still uncertain whether CLL are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients affected by CLL seem not to be prone to shedding the virus, hence, if they are asymptomatic, we can reassure them, thus avoiding hospital referral."
