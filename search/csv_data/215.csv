2141,Anti-BCMA CAR T administration in a relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patient after COVID-19 infection: a case report.,"Background: Very little is known about the risk that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection poses to cancer patients, many of whom are immune compromised causing them to be more susceptible to a host of infections. As a precautionary measure, many clinical studies halted enrollment during the initial surge of the global Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. In this case report, we detail the successful treatment of a relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patient treated with an anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy immediately following clinical recovery from COVID-19. Case presentation: The 57 year old Caucasian male patient had a 4-year history of MM and was considered penta-refractory upon presentation for CAR T cell therapy. He had a history of immunosuppression and received one dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC) the day prior to COVID-19 diagnosis; this patient was able to mount a substantial immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antiviral antibodies remain detectable 2 months after receiving anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy. The recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this patient did not exacerbate CAR T-associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and conversely the CAR T cell therapy did not result in COVID-19-related complications. One month after CAR T cell infusion, the patient was assessed to have an unconfirmed partial response per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Conclusion: Our case adds important context around treatment choice for MM patients in the era of COVID-19 and whether CAR T therapy can be administered to patients who have recovered from COVID-19. As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues, the decision of whether to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion weighing the potential risks and benefits of therapy. This case suggests that it is possible to successfully complete anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy after recovery from COVID-19. CRB-402 study registered 6 September 2017 at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03274219)."

2144,Antisense Peptide Technology for Diagnostic Tests and Bioengineering Research.,"Antisense peptide technology (APT) is based on a useful heuristic algorithm for rational peptide design. It was deduced from empirical observations that peptides consisting of complementary (sense and antisense) amino acids interact with higher probability and affinity than the randomly selected ones. This phenomenon is closely related to the structure of the standard genetic code table, and at the same time, is unrelated to the direction of its codon sequence translation. The concept of complementary peptide interaction is discussed, and its possible applications to diagnostic tests and bioengineering research are summarized. Problems and difficulties that may arise using APT are discussed, and possible solutions are proposed. The methodology was tested on the example of SARS-CoV-2. It is shown that the CABS-dock server accurately predicts the binding of antisense peptides to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain without requiring predefinition of the binding site. It is concluded that the benefits of APT outweigh the costs of random peptide screening and could lead to considerable savings in time and resources, especially if combined with other computational and immunochemical methods."

2146,"Evaluation of four commercial, fully automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests suggests a revision of the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay.","Objectives: Serological tests detect antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Independent external clinical validation of performance characteristics is of paramount importance. Methods: Four fully automated assays, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total (COV2T) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (COV2G) were evaluated using 350 pre-pandemic samples and 700 samples from 245 COVID-19 patients (158 hospitalized, 87 outpatients). Results: All tests showed very high diagnostic specificity. Sensitivities in samples collected at least 14 days after disease onset were slightly lower than manufacturers' claims for Roche (93.0%), Abbott (90.8%), and Siemens COV2T (90.3%), and distinctly lower for Siemens COV2G (78.8%). Concordantly negative results were enriched for immunocompromised patients. ROC curve analyses suggest a lowering of the cut-off index for the Siemens COV2G assay. Finally, the combination of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is feasible when considering borderline reactive results. Conclusions: Thorough on-site evaluation of commercially available serologic tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remains imperative for laboratories. The potentially impaired sensitivity of the Siemens COV2G necessitates a switch to the company's newly filed SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay for follow-up studies. A combination of tests could be considered in clinical practice."
2147,"COVID-19 Outbreak Associated with a SARS-CoV-2 R.1 Lineage Variant in a Skilled Nursing Facility After Vaccination Program - Kentucky, March 2021.","Although COVID-19 mRNA vaccines demonstrated high efficacy in clinical trials (1), they were not 100% efficacious. Thus, some infections postvaccination are expected. Limited data are available on effectiveness in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and against emerging variants. The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) and a local health department investigated a COVID-19 outbreak in a SNF that occurred after all residents and health care personnel (HCP) had been offered vaccination. Among 83 residents and 116 HCP, 75 (90.4%) and 61 (52.6%), respectively, received 2 vaccine doses. Twenty-six residents and 20 HCP received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including 18 residents and four HCP who had received their second vaccine dose >14 days before the outbreak began. An R.1 lineage variant was detected with whole genome sequencing (WGS). Although the R.1 variant has multiple spike protein mutations, vaccinated residents and HCP were 87% less likely to have symptomatic COVID-19 compared with those who were unvaccinated. Vaccination of SNF populations, including HCP, is critical to reduce the risk for SARS-CoV-2 introduction, transmission, and severe outcomes in SNFs. An ongoing focus on infection prevention and control practices is also essential."
2148,An ultrafast SARS-CoV-2 virus enrichment and extraction method compatible with multiple modalities for RNA detection.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic RNA virus characterized by high transmission rates and pathogenicity worldwide. Continued control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires the diversification of rapid, easy to use, sensitive, and portable methods for SARS-CoV-2 sample preparation and analysis. Here, we propose a method for SARS-CoV-2 viral enrichment and enzymatic extraction of RNA from clinically relevant matrices in under 10 min. This technique utilizes affinity-capture hydrogel particles to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from solution, and leverages existing PDQeX technology for RNA isolation. Characterization of our method is accomplished with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for relative, comparative RNA detection. In a double-blind study analyzing viral transport media (VTM) obtained from clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, our sample preparation method demonstrated both comparable results to a routinely used commercial extraction kit and 100% concordance with laboratory diagnoses. Compatibility of eluates with alternative forms of analysis was confirmed using microfluidic RT-PCR (Î¼RT-PCR), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The alternative methods explored here conveyed successful amplification from all RNA eluates originating from positive clinical samples. Finally, this method demonstrated high performance within a saliva matrix across a broad range of viral titers and dilutions up to 90% saliva matrix, and sets the stage for miniaturization to the microscale."
2149,A Real-World Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Testing versus PCR Testing in Florida.,"The reported sensitivity of rapid, antigen-based diagnostics for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection varies. Few studies have evaluated rapid antigen tests in real-world settings or among large populations. Beginning October 2020, Florida offered individuals presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing PCR testing if they tested positive by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 antigen (Ag) card, were symptomatic, or required or requested PCR testing. We compared results among individuals who received both types of tests at four publicly accessible testing sites across Florida. We calculated the positive percent agreement (PPA) between the two test types by symptom status. Subsequently, we evaluated the PPA among individuals regardless of symptoms with lower cycle threshold values (<30). Overall, 18,457 individuals were tested via both methods, of which 3,153 (17.1%) were positive by PCR. The PPA for the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card using the PCR comparator was 49.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.4% to 50.9%). Among symptomatic individuals the PPA was 51.9% (95% CI, 49.7% to 54.0%). When restricted to positive PCR tests with a cycle threshold value of <30, regardless of symptom status, the PPA was 75.3% (95% CI, 72.8% to 77.6%). The PPA of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card compared with PCR was lower than that previously reported. Our findings may reflect the performance of the BinaxNOW antigen test in real-world settings."
