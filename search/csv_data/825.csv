8240,Myopericarditis in a previously healthy adolescent male following COVID-19 vaccination: A case report.,"We report the case of a previously healthy 16-year-old male who developed myopericarditis following the second dose of his Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, with no other identified triggers. Adolescents and young adults experiencing chest pain after COVD-19 vaccination should seek emergent medical care, and emergency providers should have a low threshold to consider and evaluate for myopericarditis. More data are needed to better understand the potential association between COVID-19 vaccines and myopericarditis. If a true causal link is identified, the risk must also be viewed in context with the millions of patients who have been safely vaccinated and the known morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. As we see widespread vaccine rollout, it is important that all potential adverse reactions are reported as we continue to monitor for more rare but potentially serious side effects not identified in vaccination trials."
8241,Different dose regimens of a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) in younger and older adults: A phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"Background: NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins and Matrix-M1 adjuvant. Methods and findings: The phase 2 component of our randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 to 2 trial was designed to identify which dosing regimen of NVX-CoV2373 should move forward into late-phase studies and was based on immunogenicity and safety data through Day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The trial was conducted at 9 sites in Australia and 8 sites in the United States. Participants in 2 age groups (aged 18 to 59 and 60 to 84 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 1 or 2 intramuscular doses of 5-μg or 25-μg NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, 21 days apart. Primary endpoints were immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response, 7-day solicited reactogenicity, and unsolicited adverse events. A key secondary endpoint was wild-type virus neutralizing antibody response. After enrollment, 1,288 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 vaccine groups or placebo, with 1,283 participants administered at least 1 study treatment. Of these, 45% were older participants 60 to 84 years. Reactogenicity was predominantly mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (median <3 days) after first and second vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, with higher frequencies and intensity after second vaccination and with the higher dose. Reactogenicity occurred less frequently and was of lower intensity in older participants. Both 2-dose regimens of 5-μg and 25-μg NVX-CoV2373 induced robust immune responses in younger and older participants. For the 2-dose regimen of 5 μg, geometric mean titers (GMTs) for IgG anti-spike protein were 65,019 (95% confidence interval (CI) 55,485 to 76,192) and 28,137 (95% CI 21,617 to 36,623) EU/mL and for wild-type virus neutralizing antibody (with an inhibitory concentration of 50%-MN50%) were 2,201 (95% CI 1,343 to 3,608) and 981 (95% CI 560 to 1,717) titers for younger and older participants, respectively, with seroconversion rates of 100% in both age groups. Neutralizing antibody responses exceeded those seen in a panel of convalescent sera for both age groups. Study limitations include the relatively short duration of safety follow-up to date and current lack of immune persistence data beyond the primary vaccination regimen time point assessments, but these data will accumulate over time. Conclusions: The study confirmed the phase 1 findings that the 2-dose regimen of 5-μg NVX-CoV2373 is highly immunogenic and well tolerated in younger adults. In addition, in older adults, the 2-dose regimen of 5 μg was also well tolerated and showed sufficient immunogenicity to support its use in late-phase efficacy studies. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04368988."
8242,Neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and its neuropathological alterations: Similarities with other coronaviruses.,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China, and spread quickly around the world. In addition to fever, cough and shortness of breath, it was confirmed that the patients also have manifestations towards the central nervous system (CNS), especially those critically ill ones. In this review, we will discuss how SARS-CoV-2 gain access to the CNS and the possible consequences. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 share the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can be found in the brain and mediate the disease process. Both direct attack of SARS-CoV-2 and the abnormal immune response in the CNS would contribute to the disease. Also, there is a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the occurrence of acute cerebrovascular diseases."
8243,Evidence of increasing diversification of emerging Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 strains.,"On 30th January 2020, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by a novel betacoronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization. For this reason, a detailed evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains currently circulating in different geographic regions of the world was performed. A compositional analysis as well as a Bayesian coalescent analysis of complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains recently isolated in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia was performed. The results of these studies revealed a diversification of SARS-CoV-2 strains in three different genetic clades. Co-circulation of different clades in different countries, as well as different genetic lineages within different clades were observed. The time of the most recent common ancestor was established to be around 1st November 2019. A mean rate of evolution of 6.57 × 10-4 substitutions per site per year was found. A significant migration rate per genetic lineage per year from Europe to South America was also observed. The results of these studies revealed an increasing diversification of SARS-CoV-2 strains. High evolutionary rates and fast population growth characterizes the population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 strains."

8245,"Will they, or Won't they? Examining patients' vaccine intention for flu and COVID-19 using the Health Belief Model.","Background: The twindemic of influenza and COVID-19 places pharmacists in a position of high-impact to inform and manage vaccination uptake. Given prior vaccine hesitancy in the US and the current high impact of COVID-19 on the population, it is imperative to understand and address factors that drive perceptions and intention to get vaccinated. Objectives: The objectives of the study were to 1) determine impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on influenza vaccine uptake, on patient perceptions of vaccinations, vaccine intention, and health behaviors and 2) determine vaccine intention through the Health Belief Model. Methods: An IRB-approved prospective Qualtrics-based survey was administered online to eligible respondents: non-pregnant panel respondents 18 years or older within the United States who could independently complete the entire questionnaire in English. Data analyses included descriptive statistics, psychometric analyses of the 5C and CoBQ tools, one-way ANOVA to compare demographic groups and vaccine intention items with survey scores, and mapping and path analysis of the HBM with one added domain (Decision Making Determinant, DMD). Results: 525 respondents completed the survey from October 23-29, 2020. Respondents aged 18-49, making less than $20,000 or an undisclosed income, and not having anyone close to them directly affected by COVID-19 showed a significant, negative impact of COVID-19 on health behavior and a significantly lower vaccine acceptance. The 5C and CoBQ showed moderately strong reliability. Mapping for the HBM revealed significant correlations between all modifying factors with Individual Perceptions except for Race/Ethnicity. Of the Individual Perceptions, Perceived Benefits (-.114) and Perceived Barriers (.307) significantly predicted DMD and directly impacted Vaccine Intention. DMD was not a significant mediator of Vaccination Intention. Conclusions: Vaccination messaging should focus on a simple yet balanced view of benefits and risks, targeting those under age 50 and living in low-income households, to motivate uptake of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines."
8246,Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19): An Updated Review.,"The current outbreak of novel Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major pandemic situation and a catastrophe for humans. COVID-19 is a severe infectious disease particularly of the respiratory system characterized by fatal complications such as severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmia, kidney failure/ multiple organ failure and even death. Since its discovery, the SARS-CoV-2 has spread across 213 countries or territories, causing more than 8.5 million people with a rising death toll over 5.5 million people (as of June 2020, WHO). In fact, the current looming crisis of COVID-19 has become an increasingly serious concern to public health. It has affected lives of millions of people with severe impact on health systems and economies globally. Since there are no specific drugs and/or vaccines available so far, combating COVID-19 remains to be a major challenging task. Therefore, development of potential and effective treatment regimens (prophylactic/therapeutic) is urgently required which could resolve the issue. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the coronavirus, disease epidemiology, clinical manifestations and risk factors, replication of the virus, pathophysiology and host immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The therapeutic interventions and prophylactic measures along with precautionary measures are the frontline approaches that could be undertaken in order to control and prevent the spread of the deadly and highly contagious COVID-19 are also detailed herein."
8247,Outcome of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients: A preliminary report from Northwestern Italy.,"Covid-19 pandemic is deeply affecting transplant activity worldwide. It is unclear whether solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing severe complications and how they should be managed, also concerning immunosuppression. This is a report about the course and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients from a single center in Northwestern Italy in the period March-April 2020. Three patients who were treated at our institution are reported in detail, whereas summary data are provided for those managed at peripheral Hospitals. Presentation varied from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive respiratory failure due to bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, treatment and changes to immunosuppression were adapted to the severity of the disease. Overall mortality was 20%, whereas Covid-related mortality was 10%. Two cases of prolonged (>2 months) viral carriage were observed in two asymptomatic patients who contracted the infection in the early course after transplant. Besides depicting Covid-19 course and possible treatment scenarios in liver transplant patients, these cases are discussed in relation to the changes in our practice prompted by Covid-19 epidemic, with potential implications for other transplant programs."
8248,Cellular host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed millions of lives and caused a global economic crisis. No effective antiviral drugs are currently available to treat infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The medical need imposed by the pandemic has spurred unprecedented research efforts to study coronavirus biology. Every virus depends on cellular host factors and pathways for successful replication. These proviral host factors represent attractive targets for antiviral therapy as they are genetically more stable than viral targets and may be shared among related viruses. The application of various 'omics' technologies has led to the rapid discovery of proviral host factors that are required for the completion of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. In this Review, we summarize insights into the proviral host factors that are required for SARS-CoV-2 infection that were mainly obtained using functional genetic and interactome screens. We discuss cellular processes that are important for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, as well as parallels with non-coronaviruses. Finally, we highlight host factors that could be targeted by clinically approved molecules and molecules in clinical trials as potential antiviral therapies for COVID-19."
8249,Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a Cat with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has claimed millions of human lives worldwide since the emergence of the zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China in December 2019. Notably, most severe and fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans have been associated with underlying clinical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. Here, we describe a case of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in a domestic cat (Felis catus) that presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a chronic heart condition that has been described as a comorbidity of COVID-19 in humans and that is prevalent in domestic cats. The lung and heart of the affected cat presented clear evidence of SARS-CoV-2 replication, with histological lesions similar to those observed in humans with COVID-19 with high infectious viral loads being recovered from these organs. The study highlights the potential impact of comorbidities on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and provides important information that may contribute to the development of a feline model with the potential to recapitulate the clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 in humans."
