8530,BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is significantly less effective in patients with hematologic malignancies.,"Patients with hematologic malignancies have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Vaccination against COVID-19 is especially important in these patients, but whether they develop an immune response following vaccination is unknown. We studied serologic responses to the BNT162b2 vaccine in this population. A lower proportion of patients were seropositive following vaccination (75%) than in a comparison group (99%; p < 0.001), and median (interquartile range [IQR]) antibody titers in patients were lower (90 [12.4-185.5] and 173 [133-232] AU/ml, respectively; p < 0.001). Older age, higher lactate dehydrogenase, and number of treatment lines correlated with lower seropositivity likelihood and antibody titers, while absolute lymphocyte count, globulin level, and time from last treatment to vaccination correlated with higher seropositivity likelihood and antibody titers. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients had the lowest seropositivity rate followed by indolent lymphoma. Patients recently treated with chemo-immunotherapy, anti-CD20 antibodies, BCL2, BTK or JAK2 inhibitors had significantly less seropositive responses and lower median (IQR) antibody titers (29%, 1.9 [1.9-12] AU/ml; 0%, 1.9 [1.9-1.9] AU/ml; 25%, 1.9 [1.9-25] AU/ml; 40%, 1.9 [1.9-92.8] AU/ml; and 42%, 10.9 [5.7-66.4] AU/ml, respectively; p < 0.001). Serological response to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with hematologic malignancies is considerably impaired, and they could remain at risk for severe COVID-19 infection and death."

8533,Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in FFPE Samples and Histopathologic Findings in Fatal SARS-CoV-2 Cases.,"Objectives: To report methods and findings of 2 autopsies with molecular evaluation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive individuals. Methods: Postmortem examination was completed following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public guidelines. Numerous formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue types from each case were surveyed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) from FFPE lung tissue blocks. Results: Postmortem examinations revealed diffuse alveolar damage, while no viral-associated hepatic, cardiac, or renal damage was observed. Viral RNA was detected in lungs, bronchi, lymph nodes, and spleen in both cases using qRT-PCR method. RNA sequencing using NGS in case 1 revealed mutations most consistent with Western European Clade A2a with ORF1a L3606F mutation. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 testing and viral sequencing can be performed from FFPE tissue. Detection and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in combination with morphological findings from postmortem tissue examination can aid in gaining a better understanding of the virus's pathophysiologic effects on human health."

8535,"Analysis of Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by Specimen Transport Media, Nucleic Acid Extraction Reagents, Detergents, and Fixatives.","The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a multifaceted rapid response by the scientific community, bringing researchers, health officials, and industry together to address the ongoing public health emergency. To meet this challenge, participants need an informed approach for working safely with the etiological agent, the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is currently restricted to high-containment laboratories, but material can be handled at a lower containment level after inactivation. Given the wide array of inactivation reagents that are being used in laboratories during this pandemic, it is vital that their effectiveness is thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated a total of 23 commercial reagents designed for clinical sample transportation, nucleic acid extraction, and virus inactivation for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, as well as seven other common chemicals, including detergents and fixatives. As part of this study, we have also tested five filtration matrices for their effectiveness at removing the cytotoxic elements of each reagent, permitting accurate determination of levels of infectious virus remaining following treatment. In addition to providing critical data informing inactivation methods and risk assessments for diagnostic and research laboratories working with SARS-CoV-2, these data provide a framework for other laboratories to validate their inactivation processes and to guide similar studies for other pathogens."
8536,Why is it important to report early possible COVID-19 PET/CT findings in cancer patients? Explaining with a case series.,"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) causing a pandemic mostly results in mild symptoms; however, it can evolve into serious complications. It is emphasized that if the term from the recent anticancer treatment to the diagnosis of COVID-19 was short, the probability of serious events increased in cancer patients. Therefore, early detection of COVID-19 and prevention of serious events is very important. We aimed to investigate whether it is possible to detect COVID-19 early by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the images and clinical findings of patients who underwent PET/CT due to malignancy and whose COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test were detected positive subsequently. Results: Eight cancer patients with positive COVID-19 PCR tests were included in the study. PET/CT revealed subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGOs) showing mild fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake that could be compatible with COVID-19 in 4 of 8 patients. The number of affected lobes ranged from 1-4. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR test when symptoms and/or lung findings worsened on the days after PET/CT. The time interval between the last anticancer treatment and COVID-19 diagnosis in five patients was â‰¤7 days. During the follow-up, six of the cases (75%) needed mechanical ventilation and died later. Conclusion: COVID-19 may be recognised early by detecting incidental findings in PET/CT, especially in asymptomatic cancer patients. Potential complications may be prevented by early diagnosis and anticancer therapy changes. Therefore, possible COVID-19 findings in PET/CT should be reported and the patient should be referred to relevant clinician."
8537,Dynamic changes of acquired maternal SARS-CoV-2 IgG in infants.,"At present, there are still ambiguous reports about the perinatal infection of infants born to mothers infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The dynamic characteristics of infantile serum antibodies born to mother with SARS-CoV-2 has not been well described. In this study, we analyzed the seroconversion of 27 newborns born to 26 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive rate of parturient was 80.8%, and half of their infants obtained maternal IgG. IgG transfer rates were 18.8% and 81.8% in those infants whose mother infected less and more than 2 weeks before delivery. In the first two months of life, the IgG level of infants dropped sharply to one tenth of that at birth. These results suggest that maternal SARS-CoV-2 IgG provides limited protection for infants."
8538,SARS2 simplified scores to estimate risk of hospitalization and death among patients with COVID-19.,"Although models have been developed for predicting severity of COVID-19 from the medical history of patients, simplified models with good accuracy could be more practical. In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic records were queried (02/26-07/14/2020) to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit generalized linear models for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. In the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95% CI 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization, and 0.84 [95% CI 0.74-0.94] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, Black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The models can be applied to predict the absolute risks of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid in individualizing the decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not readily available."
8539,Magnetic beads combined with carbon black-based screen-printed electrodes for COVID-19: A reliable and miniaturized electrochemical immunosensor for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva.,"The diffusion of novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus over the world generated COVID-19 pandemic event as reported by World Health Organization on March 2020. The huge issue is the high infectivity and the absence of vaccine and customised drugs allowing for hard management of this outbreak, thus a rapid and on site analysis is a need to contain the spread of COVID-19. Herein, we developed an electrochemical immunoassay for rapid and smart detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in saliva. The electrochemical assay was conceived for Spike (S) protein or Nucleocapsid (N) protein detection using magnetic beads as support of immunological chain and secondary antibody with alkaline phosphatase as immunological label. The enzymatic by-product 1-naphtol was detected using screen-printed electrodes modified with carbon black nanomaterial. The analytical features of the electrochemical immunoassay were evaluated using the standard solution of S and N protein in buffer solution and untreated saliva with a detection limit equal to 19 ng/mL and 8 ng/mL in untreated saliva, respectively for S and N protein. Its effectiveness was assessed using cultured virus in biosafety level 3 and in saliva clinical samples comparing the data using the nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested with Real-Time PCR. The agreement of the data, the low detection limit achieved, the rapid analysis (30 min), the miniaturization, and portability of the instrument combined with the easiness to use and no-invasive sampling, confer to this analytical tool high potentiality for market entry as the first highly sensitive electrochemical immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 detection in untreated saliva."
