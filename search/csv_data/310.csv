3090,Deep learning for COVID-19 detection based on CT images.,"COVID-19 has tremendously impacted patients and medical systems globally. Computed tomography images can effectively complement the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing. This study adopted a convolutional neural network for COVID-19 testing. We examined the performance of different pre-trained models on CT testing and identified that larger, out-of-field datasets boost the testing power of the models. This suggests that a priori knowledge of the models from out-of-field training is also applicable to CT images. The proposed transfer learning approach proves to be more successful than the current approaches described in literature. We believe that our approach has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in identification thus far. Based on experiments with randomly sampled training datasets, the results reveal a satisfactory performance by our model. We investigated the relevant visual characteristics of the CT images used by the model; these may assist clinical doctors in manual screening."
3091,Effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in a Veterans Affairs Cohort of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease With Diverse Exposure to Immunosuppressive Medications.,"Background & aims: Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly expanded; however, clinical trials excluded patients taking immunosuppressive medications such as those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we explored real-world effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination on subsequent infection in patients with IBD with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients in the Veterans Health Administration with IBD diagnosed before December 18, 2020, the start date of the Veterans Health Administration patient vaccination program. IBD medication exposures included mesalamine, thiopurines, anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic agents, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, methotrexate, and corticosteroid use. We used inverse probability weighting and Cox's regression with vaccination status as a time-updating exposure and computed vaccine effectiveness from incidence rates. Results: The cohort comprised 14,697 patients, 7321 of whom received at least 1 vaccine dose (45.2% Pfizer, 54.8% Moderna). The cohort had median age 68 years, 92.2% were men, 80.4% were White, and 61.8% had ulcerative colitis. In follow-up data through April 20, 2021, unvaccinated individuals had the highest raw proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection (197 [1.34%] vs 7 [0.11%] fully vaccinated). Full vaccination status, but not partial vaccination status, was associated with a 69% reduced hazard of infection relative to an unvaccinated status (hazard ratio, 0.31, 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.56; P < .001), corresponding to an 80.4% effectiveness. Conclusions: Full vaccination (> 7 days after the second dose) against SARS-CoV-2 infection has an âˆ¼80.4% effectiveness in a broad IBD cohort with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. These results may serve to increase patient and provider willingness to pursue vaccination in these settings."

3095,Source and symptoms of COVID-19 among hospital workers in Milan.,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are commonly infected by SARS-CoV-2 and represent one of the most vulnerable groups. Adequate prevention strategies are necessary to guarantee HCWs' safety, as well as to prevent dissemination of the infection among patients. Aims: To describe a case series of SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs in a large public healthcare organization in Milan (Italy) during the most devastating weeks of the epidemic and analyse the sources, symptoms and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: This study included 172 SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs who were infected between the 25th of February and the 7th of April 2020. A nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and RT-PCR were used to indicate. Results: Initially, the most common sources of infection were other positive HCWs (49%). Medical doctors and nursing assistants were most frequently infected, with infection rates of 53/1000 and 50/1000, respectively. COVID-19 departments were less affected than internal medicine, surgery, intensive care, or emergency room. The most commonly reported symptom was mild cough, while loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia) were reported as moderate and severe by 30-40% of HCWs. The time necessary for 50% of workers to recover from the infection was 23 days, while it took 41 days for 95% of HCWs to become virus-free. Conclusions: HCWs are commonly infected due to close contacts with other positive HCWs, and non-COVID departments were most affected. Most HCWs were asymptomatic or subclinical but contact tracing and testing of asymptomatic HCWs help identify and isolate infected workers."
3096,"Antibodies against Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induced by BNT162b2 vaccine: results from a pragmatic, real-life study.","Background: As part of the fight against SARS CoV2 infection, vaccination program for health workers at Giannina Gaslini pediatric hospital (IGG) in Genoa, Italy, started on December 2020. We evaluated the anti-Spike protein response in healthcare workers after a complete vaccination scheme of 2 doses spaced by 3 weeks. Methods: Immunoglobulin class G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD were detected by means of a chemiluminescence immunoassay for quantitative IgG antibodies using Maglumi SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD IgG kit during the 3rd week after vaccination completion. Results: IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were detected in 99.88% of 1765 healthcare workers 3 weeks after 2nd dose of BNT162b2. Higher median IgG values were observed in younger subjects (807 UA/mL in under 30 vs 429 UA/mL in over 60; p < 0.001) and those with previous COVID-19 (1284 vs 574 UA/mL; p < 0.001). Conclusion: BNT162b2 is effective in inducing anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies even in real-life setting. The higher antibody title observed in workers with a previous documented SARS CoV2 infection confirms the possibility to carry out only one dose of BNT162b2 in a context of vaccines shortage."
3097,An International survey on living kidney donation and transplant practices during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The scope of the impact of the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic on living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) practices across the world is not well-defined. We received survey responses from 204 transplant centers internationally from May to June 2020 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on LDKT practices. Respondents represented 16 countries on five continents. Overall, 75% of responding centers reported that LDKT surgery was on hold (from 67% of North American centers to 91% of European centers). The majority (59%) of centers reported that new donor evaluations were stopped (from 46% of North American centers to 86% of European centers), with additional 23% of centers reporting important decrease in evaluations. Only 10% of centers reported slight variations on their evaluations. For the centers that continued donor evaluations, 40% performed in-person visits, 68% by video, and 42% by telephone. Center concerns for donor (82%) and recipient (76%) safety were the leading barriers to LDKT during the pandemic, followed by patients concerns (48%), and government restrictions (46%). European centers reported more barriers related to staff limitations while North and Latin American centers were more concerned with testing capacity and insufficient resources including protective equipment. As LDKT resumes, 96% of the programs intend to screen donor and recipient pairs for coronavirus infection, most of them with polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples. The COVID-19 pandemic has had broad impact on all aspects of LDKT practice. Ongoing research and consensus-building are needed to guide safe reopening of LDKT programs."
3098,Artificial intelligence predicts the immunogenic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 leading to universal blueprints for vaccine designs.,"The global population is at present suffering from a pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The goal of this study was to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant ""epitope hotspot"" regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3,400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA haplotypes of approximately 22,000 individuals to develop a ""digital twin"" type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population; the approach identified an optimal constellation of epitope hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identified a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population."
3099,CRISPR is a useful biological tool for detecting nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 in human clinical samples.,"The recent pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally and infected millions of people. The quick and specific detection of the nucleic acid of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a challenge within healthcare providers. Currently, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the widely used method to detect the SARS-CoV-2 from the human clinical samples. RT-qPCR is expensive equipment and needs skilled personnel as well as lengthy detection time. RT-qPCR limitation needed an alternative healthcare technique to overcome with a fast and cheaper detection method. By applying the principles of CRISPR technology, several promising detection methods giving hope to the healthcare community. CRISPR-based detection methods include SHERLOCK-Covid, STOP-Covid, AIOD-CRISPR, and DETECTR platform. These methods have comparative advantages and drawbacks. Among these methods, AIOD-CRISPR and DETECTR are reasonably better diagnostic methods than the others if we compare the time taken for the test, the cost associated with each test, and their capability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical samples. It may expect that the promising CRISPR-based methods would facilitate point-of-care (POC) applications in the CRISPR-built next-generation novel coronavirus diagnostics."
