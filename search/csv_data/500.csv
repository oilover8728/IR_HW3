4990,Reserving coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines for global access: cross sectional analysis.,"Objective: To analyze the premarket purchase commitments for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccines from leading manufacturers to recipient countries. Design: Cross sectional analysis. Data sources: World Health Organization's draft landscape of covid-19 candidate vaccines, along with company disclosures to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, company and foundation press releases, government press releases, and media reports. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: Premarket purchase commitments for covid-19 vaccines, publicly announced by 15 November 2020. Main outcome measures: Premarket purchase commitments for covid-19 vaccine candidates and price per course, vaccine platform, and stage of research and development, as well as procurement agent and recipient country. Results: As of 15 November 2020, several countries have made premarket purchase commitments totaling 7.48 billion doses, or 3.76 billion courses, of covid-19 vaccines from 13 vaccine manufacturers. Just over half (51%) of these doses will go to high income countries, which represent 14% of the world's population. The US has reserved 800 million doses but accounts for a fifth of all covid-19 cases globally (11.02 million cases), whereas Japan, Australia, and Canada have collectively reserved more than one billion doses but do not account for even 1% of current global covid-19 cases globally (0.45 million cases). If these vaccine candidates were all successfully scaled, the total projected manufacturing capacity would be 5.96 billion courses by the end of 2021. Up to 40% (or 2.34 billion) of vaccine courses from these manufacturers might potentially remain for low and middle income countries-less if high income countries exercise scale-up options and more if high income countries share what they have procured. Prices for these vaccines vary by more than 10-fold, from $6.00 (£4.50; €4.90) per course to as high as $74 per course. With broad country participation apart from the US and Russia, the COVAX Facility-the vaccines pillar of the World Health Organization's Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator-has secured at least 500 million doses, or 250 million courses, and financing for half of the targeted two billion doses by the end of 2021 in efforts to support globally coordinated access to covid-19 vaccines. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of how high income countries have secured future supplies of covid-19 vaccines but that access for the rest of the world is uncertain. Governments and manufacturers might provide much needed assurances for equitable allocation of covid-19 vaccines through greater transparency and accountability over these arrangements."

4992,Indian citizen's perspective about side effects of COVID-19 vaccine - A machine learning study.,"Background and aims: Ever since the vaccination drive for COVID-19 has started in India, the citizens have been sharing their views on social media about it. The present study examines the attitude of Indian citizens towards the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: Social media posts were used for this research. Using Python, we have collected social media posts of Indians focusing on side effects of COVID -19 vaccines. In study one, sentimental analysis was done to find overall attitude of Indian citizens towards the side effects of COVID-19 vaccine and in study two, topic modeling done to analyze the major side effects voiced out by the citizens after taking COVID-19 vaccine. Results: The studies conducted have revealed that nearly 78.5% of tweets posted by Indian citizens about the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine were either in neutral or positive sentiments. Our topic modeling studies have found that fear of efficiency in the workplace and the fear of death as the prime two issues that contributes Indian citizens to have negative sentiment about the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: While it is important for the Indian government to actively encourage its citizens to have vaccine, it is also important to help the citizens understand the important of the vaccination program. The best way to educate citizens regarding the positive aspect of the vaccination program is by addressing the fears, Indian citizens have voiced in their social media post about the COVID-19 vaccines."
4993,Immune responses to a single dose of the AZD1222/Covishield vaccine in health care workers.,"Several COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency approval. Here we assess the immunogenicity of a single dose of the AZD1222 vaccine, at one month, in a cohort of health care workers (HCWs) (629 naïve and 26 previously infected). 93.4% of naïve HCWs seroconverted, irrespective of age and gender. Haemagglutination test for antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD), surrogate neutralization assay (sVNT) and ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot assays were carried out in a sub-cohort. ACE2 blocking antibodies (measured by sVNT) were detected in 67/69 (97.1%) of naïve HCWs. Antibody levels to the RBD of the wild-type virus were higher than to RBD of B.1.1.7, and titres to B.1.351 were very low. Ex vivo T cell responses were observed in 30.8% to 61.7% in naïve HCWs. Previously infected HCWs, developed significantly higher (p < 0.0001) ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to the RBD for the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. This study shows high seroconversion after one vaccine dose, but also suggests that one vaccine dose may be insufficient to protect against emerging variants."
4994,Mechanisms of socioeconomic differences in COVID-19 screening and hospitalizations.,"Background: Social and ecological differences in early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic screening and outcomes have been documented, but the means by which these differences have arisen are not well understood. Objective: To characterize socioeconomic and chronic disease-related mechanisms underlying these differences. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Outpatient and emergency care. Patients: 12900 Cleveland Clinic Health System patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 testing between March 17 and April 15, 2020. Interventions: Nasopharyngeal PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Measurements: Test location (emergency department, ED, vs. outpatient care), COVID-19 symptoms, test positivity and hospitalization among positive cases. Results: We identified six classes of symptoms, ranging in test positivity from 3.4% to 23%. Non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity was disproportionately represented in the group with highest positivity rates. Non-Hispanic Black patients ranged from 1.81 [95% confidence interval: 0.91-3.59] times (at age 20) to 2.37 [1.54-3.65] times (at age 80) more likely to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus than non-Hispanic White patients, while test positivity was not significantly different across the neighborhood income spectrum. Testing in the emergency department (OR: 5.4 [3.9, 7.5]) and cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.5 [1.7, 3.8]) were related to increased risk of hospitalization among the 1247 patients who tested positive. Limitations: Constraints on availability of test kits forced providers to selectively test for SARS-Cov-2. Conclusion: Non-Hispanic Black patients and patients from low-income neighborhoods tended toward more severe and prolonged symptom profiles and increased comorbidity burden. These factors were associated with higher rates of testing in the ED. Non-Hispanic Black patients also had higher test positivity rates."
4995,Factors influencing Covid-19 vaccine acceptance across subgroups in the United States: Evidence from a conjoint experiment.,"Public health officials warn that the greatest barrier to widespread vaccination against Covid-19 will not be scientific or technical, but the considerable public hesitancy to take a novel vaccine. Understanding the factors that influence vaccine acceptance is critical to informing public health campaigns aiming to combat public fears and ensure broad uptake. Employing a conjoint experiment embedded on an online survey of almost 2,000 adult Americans, we show that the effects of seven vaccine attributes on subjects' willingness to vaccinate vary significantly across subgroups. Vaccine efficacy was significantly more influential on vaccine acceptance among whites than among Blacks, while bringing a vaccine to market under a Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization had a stronger adverse effect on willingness to vaccinate among older Americans and women. Democrats were more sensitive to vaccine efficacy than Republicans, and both groups responded differently to various endorsements of the vaccine. We also explored whether past flu vaccination history, attitudes toward general vaccine safety, and personal contact with severe cases of Covid-19 can explain variation in group vaccination hesitancy. Many subgroups that exhibit the greatest Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy did not report significantly lower frequencies of flu vaccination. Several groups that exhibited greater Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy also reported greater concerns about vaccine safety generally, but others did not. Finally, subgroup variation in reported personal contact with severe cases of Covid-19 did not strongly match subgroup variation in vaccine acceptance."
4996,Clinical and immunologic implications of COVID-19 in patients with melanoma and renal cell carcinoma receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors.,"The clinical and immunologic implications of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for patients with cancer receiving systemic anticancer therapy have introduced a multitude of clinical challenges and academic controversies. This review summarizes the current evidence, discussion points, and recommendations regarding the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with cancer during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with a focus on patients with melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). More specifically, we summarize the theoretical concepts and available objective data regarding the relationships between ICIs and the antiviral immune response, along with recommended clinical approaches to the management of melanoma and RCC patient cohorts receiving ICIs throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional insights regarding the use of ICIs in the setting of current and upcoming COVID-19 vaccines and broader implications toward future pandemics are also discussed."
4997,Understanding COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Pakistan: an echo of previous immunizations or prospect of change?,"Background: As countries ramp up their COVID-19 vaccination programs, attitudes of the population remain a determining player in the success of these plans. This study analyses the factors associated with intent to vaccinate against COVID-19 in the Pakistani population. Methodology: This cross-sectional, anonymous, online survey was carried out in April 2021. Participants' demographic details, experiences relating to COVID-19 and its vaccination, and their health beliefs were inquired and divided across Health Belief Model constructs. Multivariable regression was used to determine factors associated with a No/Not sure vs Yes response for vaccination intention. Results: Of the 655 respondents, 62.0% were willing to get vaccinated. Significant predictors of a less likelihood of resisting vaccination included advanced age (AOR 0.25; 95% CI 0.07-0.88), fear of contracting COVID-19 (AOR 0.47; 95% CI 0.27-0.82), hope of preventing its spread (AOR 0.30; 95% CI 0.19-0.49), and community pressure (AOR 0.22; 95% CI 0.13-0.37). Concerns about vaccine reliability (AOR 2.75; 95% CI 1.67-4.53) and religious inhibitions (AOR 2.45; 95% CI 1.34-4.48) swayed people away from vaccination. Conclusion: Despite a reasonably good response of Pakistanis to vaccination, factors negatively influencing their intention need to be timely addressed to control this pandemic."
4998,"Association between laboratory parameters and CT severity in patients infected with Covid-19: A retrospective, observational study.","Introduction: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have presented to emergency departments (EDs) worldwide with a wide range of symptoms. In this study we reported the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of the cases diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: This is a single-center, retrospective, descriptive, and observational study. The patients who have admitted to ED between March 11 and May 31, 2020 and diagnosed COVID-19 infection. Results: 130 (73 male and 57 female) patients with COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive test were included in the study. The average age of the study group was calculated as 52.63 ± 17.95 year. While 15.4% of the patients were asymptomatic, the most common symptom was identified as cough (46.2%), followed by dyspnea (23.1%), fever (17.7%). The computed tomography (CT) severity scores proved significantly higher in the patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) than in those without these diseases (p = 0.010 and p = 0.042, respectively). The moderate positive correlation between serum ferritin level and CT severity score is another finding worth noting (rho = 0.530 and p = 0.0001). In a similar vein, the high level of D-dimer in the CT-positive group and its positive moderate correlation with CT severity (rho = 0.375 and p = 0.0001). Conclusion: In our study, serum ferritin and D-dimer levels were observed to be high in the CT-positive group and have moderate positive correlation with CT severity. We thus argue that D-dimer and ferritin levels measured at the time of admission to the ED can be taken into consideration to predict radiological severity."
4999,COVID-19 Outbreak and Presymptomatic Transmission in Pilgrim Travelers Who Returned to Korea from Israel.,"Background: On February 21, 2020, 2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in pilgrim travelers from Korea to Israel were identified. We investigated the source of infection, clinical features of COVID-19, and transmission potential of presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Methods: All 39 pilgrim travelers were aggressively tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Their clinical features and possible source of infection were investigated by interview and review of their medical records. Ten confirmed cases without symptoms at the first sampling dates were selected for follow-up reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests. Results: Of 39 pilgrim travelers, 30 (77%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the 30 positive COVID-19 cases, 4 (13%) were asymptomatic. Available follow-up cycle threshold values from 10 cases gradually increased over time and were lower during the presymptomatic period than during the postsymptomatic period. Out of 328 contacts related to the COVID-19 cases in the pilgrim travelers, 22 additional cases (7%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Three tertiary cases were identified to be transmitted by presymptomatic secondary cases. Conclusion: To prevent transmission of COVID-19, we need to focus on presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and massive testing for SARS-CoV-2 is required. More research about the possibility of presymptomatic transmission over 2 days before symptom onset is required."
