7240,In-silico homology assisted identification of inhibitor of RNA binding against 2019-nCoV N-protein (N terminal domain).,"The N terminal domain (NTD) of Nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of coronavirus (CoV) binds to the viral (+) sense RNA and results in CoV ribonucleoprotien (CoV RNP) complex, essential for the virus replication. In this study, the RNA-binding N terminal domain (NTD) of the N protein was targeted for the identification of possible inhibitors of RNA binding. Two NTD structures of N proteins were selected (2OFZ and 1SSK, 92% homology) for virtual screening of 56,079 compounds from Asinex and Maybridge library to identify top 15 hits for each of the targets based on 'docking score'. These top-hits were further screened for MM-GBSA binding free energy, pharmacokinetic properties (QikProp) and drug-likeness (SwissADME) and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) studies. Two suitable binders (ZINC00003118440 and ZINC0000146942) against the target 2OFZ were identified. ZINC00003118440 is a theophylline derivative under the drug class 'bronchodilators' and further screening with approved bronchodilators was also studied to identify their ability to bind to the RNA binding region on the N protein. The other identified top hit is ZINC0000146942, which is a 3,4dihydropyrimidone class molecule. Hence this study suggests two important class of compounds, theophylline and pyrimidone derivaties as possible inhibitors of RNA binding to the N terminal domain of N protein of coronavirus, thus opening new avenues for in vitro validations.

7242,The possible of immunotherapy for COVID-19: A systematic review.,"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first described in late December 2019 and causes a severe respiratory infection in humans. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, international attention has raised to develop treatment and control options such as types of immunotherapies. The immunotherapy is an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. These methods include several types of vaccines, monoclonal antibody candidates, and etc. This systematic review article was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to immunotherapy for 2019-nCoV. Web of Science (ISI), PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to search for suitable keywords such as 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus, Immunotherapy, interleukin, vaccine and the related words for relevant publications up to 24.3.2020. The present systematic review was performed based on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction and quality valuation of articles were performed by two reviewers. 51 articles were the results of the search and based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 7 articles were included in the final review. As a conclusion of these studies demonstratedthat although no serious research has been done on this subject at the time of writing this article, similar studies on the related viruses showed notable results. So immunotherapy for this virus can also be a suitable option."

7246,Green giant-a tiny chloroplast genome with mighty power to produce high-value proteins: history and phylogeny.,"Free-living cyanobacteria were entrapped by eukaryotic cells ~2 billion years ago, ultimately giving rise to chloroplasts. After a century of debate, the presence of chloroplast DNA was demonstrated in the 1960s. The first chloroplast genomes were sequenced in the 1980s, followed by ~100 vegetable, fruit, cereal, beverage, oil and starch/sugar crop chloroplast genomes in the past three decades. Foreign genes were expressed in isolated chloroplasts or intact plant cells in the late 1980s and stably integrated into chloroplast genomes, with typically maternal inheritance shown in the 1990s. Since then, chloroplast genomes conferred the highest reported levels of tolerance or resistance to biotic or abiotic stress. Although launching products with agronomic traits in important crops using this concept has been elusive, commercial products developed include enzymes used in everyday life from processing fruit juice, to enhancing water absorption of cotton fibre or removal of stains as laundry detergents and in dye removal in the textile industry. Plastid genome sequences have revealed the framework of green plant phylogeny as well as the intricate history of plastid genome transfer events to other eukaryotes. Discordant historical signals among plastid genes suggest possible variable constraints across the plastome and further understanding and mitigation of these constraints may yield new opportunities for bioengineering. In this review, we trace the evolutionary history of chloroplasts, status of autonomy and recent advances in products developed for everyday use or those advanced to the clinic, including treatment of COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."

7249,Low Rates of Urologic Side Effects Following Coronavirus Disease Vaccination: An Analysis of the Food and Drug Administration Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.,"Objective: To quantify and describe urologic adverse events and symptoms after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Methods and materials: We queried the FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for all reported symptoms following the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines as of February 12th, 2021. All urologic symptoms were isolated and the reported adverse events associated with each symptom were reviewed. Results: Out of 15,785 adverse event reports, only 0.7% (113) described urologic symptoms. A total of 156 urologic symptoms were described amongst the 113 adverse event reports. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was responsible for 61% of these reports and the Moderna vaccine was responsible for 39%. These symptoms were grouped into five different categories: Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (n = 34, 22%), Hematuria (n = 22, 14%), Urinary Infection (n = 41, 26%), Skin and/or Soft Tissue (n = 16, 10%), and Other (n = 43, 28%). The median age of the patients reporting urologic symptoms was 63 years (IQR 44-79, Range: 19-96) and 54% of the patients were female. Conclusion: Urologic symptoms reported after COVID-19 vaccination are extremely rare. Given the common prevalence of many of these reported symptoms in the general population, there does not appear to be a correlation between vaccination and urologic symptoms, but as the vaccination criteria expands, further monitoring of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is needed."
