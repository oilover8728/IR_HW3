3200,"One swab, two tests: Validation of dual SARS-CoV-2 testing on the Abbott ID NOW.","Background: Point-of-care tests (POCT) are promising tools to detect SARS-CoV-2 in specific settings. Initial reports suggest the ID NOW™ COVID-19 assay (Abbott Diagnostics Inc, USA) is less sensitive than standard real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. This has raised concern over false negatives in SARS-CoV-2 POCT. Objectives: We compared the performance of the ID NOW™ COVID-19 assay to our in-house rRT-PCR assay to assess whether dry swabs used in ID NOW™ testing could be stored in transport media and be re-tested by rRT-PCR for redundancy and to provide material for further investigation. Methods: Paired respiratory swabs collected from patients at three acute care hospitals were used. One swab in transport media (McMaster Molecular Media (MMM)) was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by a laboratory-developed two-target rRT-PCR assay. The second was stored dry in a sterile container and tested by the ID NOW™ COVID-19 assay. Following ID NOW™ testing, dry swabs were stored in MMM for up to 48 h and re-tested by rRT-PCR. Serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 particles were used to assess the impact of heat inactivation and storage time. Results: Respiratory swabs (n = 343) from 179 individuals were included. Using rRT-PCR results as the comparator, the ID NOW™ COVID-19 assay had positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreements of 87.0% (95% CI:0.74-0.94) and 99.7% (95% CI:0.98-0.99). Re-tested swabs placed in MMM following ID NOW testing had PPA and NPA of 88.8% (95% CI:0.76-0.95) and 99.7% (95% CI:0.98-0.99), respectively. Conclusions: Storing spent dry swabs in transport media for redundancy rRT-PCR testing is a potential approach to address possible false negatives with the ID NOW™ COVID-19 assay."

3205,Family Physicians' Perception of the New mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines.,"Introduction: This study was conducted to assess family physicians' perception of the US Food and Drug Administration-approved mRNA Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, their plans to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and their support for vaccination of patients and family members. Methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of 307 practicing family physicians, full-time faculty physicians, and resident physicians in Kansas from December 14, 2020, to December 31, 2020. The study participants completed an anonymous, 20-item survey assessing family physicians' concerns about exposure to COVID-19 and their perceptions of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. A mixed-method approach was used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. Results: There was a 51.1% response rate. The proportion of family physicians who reported their intentions to be vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly higher than those who were hesitant to receive the mRNA vaccines (90.6% vs 9.4%; χ2 [1, n = 307] = 201.9.1; P < .0001). Among those who were willing to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the main reasons were to prevent COVID-19 infection; protect self, family, and community; contribute to herd immunity; inspire confidence that the vaccines are safe and end the pandemic and bring life back to normal. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a significantly positive association between a physician's concerns and their willingness to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. With the authorization of 2 new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, future studies should investigate the number of physicians in our study who received the vaccine."

3207,SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: A critical perspective through efficacy data and barriers to herd immunity.,"Non-pharmacological interventions and tracing-testing strategy proved insufficient to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spreading worldwide. Several vaccines with different mechanisms of action are currently under development. This review describes the potential target antigens evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in the context of both conventional and next-generation platforms. We reported experimental data from phase-3 trials with a focus on different definitions of efficacy as well as factors affecting real-life effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including logistical issues associated to vaccine availability, delivery, and immunization strategies. On this background, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed. We also provided a critical view on vaccination in special populations at higher risk of infection or severe disease as elderly people, pregnant women and immunocompromised patients. A final paragraph addresses safety on the light of the unprecedented reduction of length of the vaccine development process and faster authorization."
3208,[COVID-19: Would compulsory vaccination be legally possible?].,"As the pandemic continues, there is increasing hope vaccinations are becoming available. As a solution for a nationwide immunization against the virus, a compulsory vaccination is repeatedly discussed. However, some opponents of vaccination are threatened by the idea of a possible mandatory vaccination. It is therefore necessary to discuss whether such a compulsory vaccination is theoretically legally enforceable. This article discusses the current legal situation in Germany. The introduction of a potential compulsory vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus represents an encroachment on the fundamental right of physical integrity. According to § 20 (6) IfSG, a protective vaccination for threatened parts of the population is permissible by statutory order, if a transmissible disease with clinically severe courses occurs and its epidemic spread can be expected."
3209,"Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 East Java isolate, Indonesia.","Background: Incidents of SARS-CoV-2 in East Java increased steadily, and it became the second epicenter in Indonesia. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a dire multisectoral crisis all around the world. This study investigates and characterizes local isolates from East Java, Indonesia. Methods: There were 54 patients suspected with SARS-COV-2 infection and 27 patients were COVID-19 positive. Virus isolates were obtained from COVID-19 inpatients' nasopharyngeal swabs at the Dr Soetomo Teaching Hospital, Surabaya. There were only three isolates (#6, #11, #35) with good growth characteristics. Serial blind passage and cytopathic effect observation in the Vero E6 cell line were performed for virus isolation. Confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was proven by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions using SARS-CoV-2 specific primers, scanning electron microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy examination. Whole genome sequencing was performed using ARTIC protocol. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 characterization was identified through a western blot using rabbit serum immunized with inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and human natural COVID-19 infection serum. Results: Spike gene analysis of three samples (#6, #11, #35) found that the D614G mutation was detected in all isolates, although one isolate exhibited the D215Y and E484D mutation. Based on whole genome analysis, those three isolates were included in clade 20A, and two isolates were included in lineage B.1.6 with one isolate belongs to lineage B.1.4.7. Conclusion: Based on molecular characterization and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 East Java, Indonesia showed high titer and it has mutation in some regions."
