9630,First description of immune complex vasculitis after COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2: a case report.,"Background: Cases of immune complex vasculitis have been reported following COVID-19 infections; so far none in association with novel mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination. This case report describes a cutaneous immune complex vasculitis after vaccination with BNT162b2. Case presentation: A 76-year old male with liver cirrhosis developed an immune complex vasculitis 12 days after the second injection of BNT162b2. On physical examination, the patient presented with pruritic purpuric macules on hands and feet, flexor and extensor parts of both legs and thighs and lower abdomen, and bloody diarrhoea. Laboratory testing showed elevated inflammatory markers. After short treatment with oral steroids all clinical manifestations and laboratory findings resolved. Conclusions: An increasing number of clinical manifestations have been attributed to COVID-19 infection and vaccination. This is the first written report of immune complex vasculitis after vaccination with BNT162b2. We present our case report and a discussion in the light of type three hypersensitivity reaction."
9631,Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Agents Based on Multivalent Inhibitors of Viral Infectivity.,"The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), caused by the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), highlights the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In this Essay, it is argued that such agents already exist and are readily available while highlighting the challenges that remain to translate them into the clinic. Multivalent inhibitors of viral infectivity based on polymers or supramolecular agents and nanoparticles are shown to be broadly acting against diverse pathogens in vitro as well as in vivo. Furthermore, uniquely, such agents can be virucidal. Polymers and nanoparticles are stable, do not require cold chain of transportation and storage, and can be obtained on large scale. Specifically, for the treatment of respiratory viruses and pulmonary diseases, these agents can be administered via inhalation/nebulization, as is currently investigated in clinical trials as a treatment against SARS CoV-2/Covid-19. It is believed that with due optimization and clinical validation, multivalent inhibitors of viral infectivity can claim their rightful position as broad-spectrum antiviral agents."
9632,The emotional impact of Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (new Coronavirus disease).,"Background: A novel form of Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan has created a confused and rapidly evolving situation. In this situational framework, patients and front-line healthcare workers are vulnerable. Method: Studies were identified using large-circulation international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. Results: Populations of patients that may require tailored interventions are older adults and international migrant workers. Older adults with psychiatric conditions may be experiencing further distress. The COVID-19 epidemic has underscored potential gaps in mental health services during emergencies. Conclusions: Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training for providing mental health care. Fear seems more certainly a consequence of mass quarantine."
9633,"Autoantibodies to heat shock protein 60, 70, and 90 are not altered in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-seropositive humans without or with mild symptoms.","Highly conserved heat shock proteins (Hsps) are localized in the cytoplasm and cellular organelles, and act as molecular chaperones or proteases. Members of Hsp families are released into the extracellular milieu under both normal and stress conditions. It is hypothesized that the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to elicit autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between human extracellular Hsps and immunogenic proteins of the virus. To confirm the above hypothesis, levels of circulating autoantibodies directed to the key human chaperones i.e., Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-seropositive participants have been evaluated. Twenty-six healthy volunteers who got two doses of the mRNA vaccine encoding the viral spike protein, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive participants (n = 15), and healthy naïve (anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-negative) volunteers (n = 51) have been included in this study. We found that the serum levels of anti-Hsp60, anti-Hsp70, and anti-Hsp90 autoantibodies of the IgG, IgM, or IgA isotype remained unchanged in either the anti-COVID-19-immunized humans or the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive participants when compared to healthy naïve volunteers, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results showing that the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 did not include the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that also recognized extracellular heat shock protein 60, 70, and 90 represent a partial evaluation of the autoimmunity hypothesis stated above. Further testing for cell-based immunity will be necessary to fully evaluate this hypothesis."
9634,Risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission from donor corneal tissue: A review.,"Since the outbreak of respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there is an ongoing discussion about whether the virus could be transmitted through corneal transplantation from donor to recipient. The purpose of this review was to summarize the current knowledge in the scientific community to provide aid in risk evaluation for potential virus transfer by corneal transplants. Literature was searched in PubMed.gov for relevant articles on coronavirus in conjunction with cornea processing, cornea transplantation and eye banking. Further, guidelines of health authorities and eye banking associations were reviewed. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in ocular swabs and/or fluid of patients with COVID-19. However, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission through these ocular tissues or fluid of patients is judged differently. To date, per literature and official guidelines, no evidence of viable virus in ocular tissue and no cases of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via tissue preparations have been reported."
9635,Perspectives on therapeutic neutralizing antibodies against the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome across the world. Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high homology with that of SARS-CoV. Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority."
9636,Identification of novel compounds against three targets of SARS CoV-2 coronavirus by combined virtual screening and supervised machine learning.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major threat worldwide due to its fast spreading. As yet, there are no established drugs available. Speeding up drug discovery is urgently required. We applied a workflow of combined in silico methods (virtual drug screening, molecular docking and supervised machine learning algorithms) to identify novel drug candidates against COVID-19. We constructed chemical libraries consisting of FDA-approved drugs for drug repositioning and of natural compound datasets from literature mining and the ZINC database to select compounds interacting with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins (spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, and 2'-o-ribose methyltransferase). Supported by the supercomputer MOGON, candidate compounds were predicted as presumable SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Interestingly, several approved drugs against hepatitis C virus (HCV), another enveloped (-) ssRNA virus (paritaprevir, simeprevir and velpatasvir) as well as drugs against transmissible diseases, against cancer, or other diseases were identified as candidates against SARS-CoV-2. This result is supported by reports that anti-HCV compounds are also active against Middle East Respiratory Virus Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. The candidate compounds identified by us may help to speed up the drug development against SARS-CoV-2."

9638,A systematic review of human coronaviruses survival on environmental surfaces.,"The current pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led people to implement preventive measures, including surface disinfection and use of alcohol-based hand gel, in order to avoid viral transmission via fomites. However, the role of surface transmission is still debated. The present systematic review aims to summarize all the evidence on surface survival of coronaviruses infecting humans. The analysis of 18 studies showed the longest coronavirus survival time is 28 days at room temperature (RT) on different surfaces: polymer banknotes, vinyl, steel, glass, and paper banknotes. Concerning SARS-CoV-2 human infection from contaminated surfaces, dangerous viral load on surfaces for up to 21 days was determined on polymer banknotes, steel, glass and paper banknotes. For viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, the longest period of survival was 14 days, recorded on glass. Environmental conditions can affect virus survival, and indeed, low temperatures and low humidity support prolonged survival of viruses on contaminated surfaces independently of surface type. Furthermore, it has been shown that exposure to sunlight significantly reduces the risk of surface transmission. Although studies are increasingly investigating the topic of coronavirus survival, it is difficult to compare them, given the methodology differences. For this reason, it is advisable to define a reference working protocol for virus survival trials, but, as an immediate measure, there is also a need for further investigations of coronavirus survival on surfaces."
