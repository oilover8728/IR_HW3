2580,Maintaining Maternal-Newborn Safety During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. In addition to older individuals and those with underlying chronic health conditions, maternal and newborn populations were also identified as being at greater risk. It became critical for hospitals and clinicians to maintain the safety of individuals in the facility and minimize the transmission of COVID-19 while continuing to strive for optimized outcomes by providing family-centered care. Rapid change during the pandemic made it appropriate to use the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle to continually evaluate proposed and standard practices. Our team established an obstetric COVID-19 unit for women and newborns, developed guidelines for visitation and for the use of personal protective equipment, initiated universal COVID-19 testing, and provided health education to emphasize shared decision making."

2582,Advances of Inorganic Materials in the Detection and Therapeutic Uses against Coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with particle-like characteristics and a diameter of 60-140 nm, positively charged, and single-stranded RNA genomes, which caused a major outbreak of human fatal pneumonia in the beginning of the 21st century. COVID-19 is currently considered a continuous potential pandemic threat across the globe. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to develop innovative methods and technologies for suppressing the spread of viruses as well as inactivating the viruses but COVID-19 vaccines are still in the development phase. This perspective focuses on the sensing, detection and therapeutic applications of CoVs using inorganic- based nanomaterials, metal complexes, and metal-conjugates. Synthetic inorganic- based nanoparticles interact strongly with proteins of viruses due to their morphological similarities, and therefore, numerous antivirals have been tested for efficacy against different viruses in vitro through colorimetric and electrochemical assays. Metal complexes- based agents such as bismuth complexes form an attractive class of drugs with a number of therapeutic applications, including the inhibition and duplex-unwinding activity of SARS-CoV helicase by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR), phosphate release assay and radioassay studies. Metal-conjugates show major effects on inhibiting the 3Clike protease of SARS-CoV and the replication of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We anticipate that these approaches will provide rapid and accurate antiviral strategies in the development of these innovative sensors for the detection, inhibition and antiviral activities of coronaviruses."
2583,Global access to COVID-19 vaccines: a scoping review of factors that may influence equitable access for low and middle-income countries.,"Objective: To identify the factors contributing to equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Methods: We conducted a scoping review following the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews and a five-stage framework for scoping studies. We performed systematic searches for published peer-reviewed literature in five databases: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Global Index Medicus and COVID-19 Evidence Epistemonikos (August 2020, updated May 2021). Results: Systematic selection according to predefined criteria resulted in the final inclusion of 45 peer-reviewed articles, with no limitations on study design or publication type. We derived four key factors that potentially influence equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines in LMICs: (1) collectively agreed global mechanisms or frameworks; (2) bilateral purchasing, contracting, and vaccine prices; (3) vaccine manufacturing that is supported by sharing know-how; and (4) countries' strength in implementing vaccination programmes. Conclusions: This scoping review highlights the ongoing challenges for the international community in ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for LMICs. The literature suggests that vaccine manufacturing can influence the supply of vaccines, as can the role of patent holders who can influence global governance through their role in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Our findings indicate that including the principles of equitable access throughout vaccine research and development, procurement, scale-up and distribution processes can support equitable access for LMICs. Advances made with mRNA vaccines may have additional benefits in relation to expanding the manufacturing of other vaccine. Finally, the exploration and scale-up of such capacities of LMICs are likely to prove to be a valuable investment, even after the pandemic."

The analyses of 30 kb RNA SARS-CoVs genome sequences, protein structures, and functions have provided us a perspective of how host-virus protein-protein complexes act to mediate virus infection. The open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b translation yields 16 non-structural (nsp1-16) and 6 accessory proteins (p6, p7a, p8ab, p9b) with multiple functional domains. Viral proteins recruit over 300 host partners forming hetero-oligomeric complexes enabling the viral RNA synthesis, packing, and virion release. Many cellular host factors and the innate immune cells through pattern-recognition receptors and intracellular RNA sensor molecules act to inhibit virus entry and intracellular replication. However, non-structural ORF proteins hijack them and suppress interferon synthesis and its antiviral effects. Pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines storm leads to dysfunctional inflammation, lung injury, and several clinical symptoms in patients. During the global pandemic, COVID-19 patients were identified with non-synonymous substitution of G614D in the spike protein, indicating virus co-evolution in host cells. We review findings that suggest that host RNA editing and DNA repair systems, while carrying on recombination, mutation, and repair of viral RNA intermediates, may facilitate virus evolution. Understanding how the host cell RNA replication process may be driven by SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome fitness will help the testing of vaccines effectiveness to multiple independent mutated coronavirus strains that will emerge."

2588,[Evaluation of fast nucleic acid detection system in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2].,"Objective: To evaluate the performance and application of a fast nucleic acid detection system for testing severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-COV-2). Methods: Clinical samples were collected from February to July 2020 from Beijing Center for Diseases Prevention and Control and the Laboratory Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, anti-interference ability, precision and clinical sample coincidence rate of fast nucleic acid detection system for SARS-CoV-2. The analytical sensitivity was determined by a dilution series of 20 replications for each concentration. Analytical specificity study was performed by testing organisms whose infection produces symptoms similar to those observed at the onset of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and of the normal or pathogenic microflora that may be present in specimens collected. Potential interference substances were evaluated with different concentration in the interference study. Precision study was conducted by estimating intra-and inter-batch variability. Clinical evaluation was performed by testing 230 oropharyngeal swab specimens and 95 sputum specimens in fast nucleic acid detection system, comparing with conventional real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and clinical diagnostic results. Results: The analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 using fast nucleic acid detection system was 400 copies/ml. The result is negative for testing with the organisms that may likely in the circulating area or causing similar symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 and human nucleic acid, indicating that no cross reactivity with organisms. The results of precision test showed that the Coefficient of variation of Ct value of high, medium and low concentration samples was 1.90%-3.92%, and all of them were less than 5% in intra-and inter-batch testing. The results of the samples were still positive after adding the potential interfering substances, indicating that the possible interfering substances in the samples had no effect on the results. 98.46% and 97.85% diagnosis results of fast nucleic acid detection system were consistent with RT-qPCR and clinical diagnostic results, respectively. Conclusion: The fast nucleic acid detection system based on molecular parallel reaction can be used as a selection method for SARS-CoV-2 testing."
