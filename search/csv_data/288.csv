2870,Rapid development of neutralizing and diagnostic SARS-COV-2 mouse monoclonal antibodies.,"The need for high-affinity, SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is critical in the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic, as such reagents can have important diagnostic, research, and therapeutic applications. Of greatest interest is the ~ 300 amino acid receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit of the spike protein because of its key interaction with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor present on many cell types, especially lung epithelial cells. We report here the development and functional characterization of 29 nM-affinity mouse SARS-CoV-2 mAbs created by an accelerated immunization and hybridoma screening process. Differing functions, including binding of diverse protein epitopes, viral neutralization, impact on RBD-hACE2 binding, and immunohistochemical staining of infected lung tissue, were correlated with variable gene usage and sequence."
2871,Direct diagnostic testing of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for prior RNA extraction.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an urgent need for a rapid, point of care diagnostic testing that could be rapidly scaled on a worldwide level. We developed and tested a highly sensitive and robust assay based on reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) that uses readily available reagents and a simple heat block using contrived spike-in and actual clinical samples. RT-LAMP testing on RNA-spiked samples showed a limit of detection (LoD) of 2.5 copies/Î¼l of viral transport media. RT-LAMP testing directly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples in viral transport media had an 85% positive percentage agreement (PPA) (17/20), and 100% negative percentage agreement (NPV) and delivered results in 30 min. Our optimized RT-LAMP based testing method is a scalable system that is sufficiently sensitive and robust to test for SARS-CoV-2 directly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples in viral transport media in 30 min at the point of care without the need for specialized or proprietary equipment or reagents. This cost-effective and efficient one-step testing method can be readily available for COVID-19 testing world-wide, especially in resource poor settings."
2872,SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using medical imaging techniques and artificial intelligence: A review.,"Objective: SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health emergency with unrecognized clinical features. This paper aims to review the most recent medical imaging techniques used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and their potential contributions to attenuate the pandemic. Recent researches, including artificial intelligence tools, will be described. Methods: We review the main clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by different medical imaging techniques. First, we present the clinical findings of each technique. Then, we describe several artificial intelligence approaches introduced for the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Results: CT is the most accurate diagnostic modality of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, ground-glass opacities and consolidation are the most common signs of SARS-CoV-2 in CT images. However, other findings such as reticular pattern, and crazy paving could be observed. We also found that pleural effusion and pneumothorax features are less common in SARS-CoV-2. According to the literature, the B lines artifacts and pleural line irregularities are the common signs of SARS-CoV-2 in ultrasound images. We have also stated the different studies, focusing on artificial intelligence tools, to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 severity. We found that most of the reported works based on deep learning focused on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from medical images while the challenge for the radiologists is how to differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections with the same clinical features. Conclusion: The identification of SARS-CoV-2 manifestations on medical images is a key step in radiological workflow for the diagnosis of the virus and could be useful for researchers working on computer-aided diagnosis of pulmonary infections."

2875,Transforming COVID-19 vaccines into vaccination : Challenges and opportunities for management scientists.,"Amid the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, the miraculous breakthroughs of multiple effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines offer hopeful prospects. Yet, the endgame of the pandemic is not vaccines; it is vaccination. The daunting challenge of vaccinating the world offers ample investigative opportunities for management scientists who are interested in improving the efficiency and equity of vaccine supply chains. In this article, we provide a brief overview of these opportunities through three constituent parts: (1) supply, (2) demand, and (3) matching supply with demand."
2876,Universal symptom monitoring to address presenteeism in healthcare workers.,"Background: The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic has required rapid development of both governmental and institutional policies and protocols to minimize transmission. We describe our institution's implementation of a symptom monitoring program with this goal. Methods: We developed a symptom monitoring tool based on our return-to-work guidelines using a Qualtrics survey tool. We implemented this for healthcare workers (HCWs) and provided individualized real time guidance and linkage to COVID-19 testing if indicated. Results: During the period from April 2nd to April 17th, 2020, 9446 HCWs had enrolled in the symptom tracking survey, with 5,035 HCWs completing the survey daily at the end of this period. 1,318 HCWs had been identified as being symptomatic with an indication for SARS-CoV-2 testing and were directed to the hotline to have this ordered. Of these, 82% reported not currently staying home from work due to illness or quarantine when first reporting symptoms. Discussion and conclusions: A survey based symptom monitoring tool can be rapidly designed and implemented, and incorporated with a testing strategy. Our results show the potential for quick uptake, and effectiveness in identifying and addressing presenteeism. We report our large academic institution's experience as a model to be adapted for use in this and future pandemics."

2878,"Acceptability of COVID-19 Certificates: A Qualitative Study in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2020.","Immunity certificates related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been under discussion since the beginning of the pandemic with conflicting opinions. In order to identify arguments in favor of and against the possible implementation of documents certifying immunity of an individual based on serological testing, we developed a qualitative study in Geneva, Switzerland. The study took place between two lockdowns with a sense of semi-normalcy during summer 2020 in Switzerland but at a time when no vaccine was available and seroprevalence was below 21%. Eleven focus groups with members of the public and 14 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders were conducted between July and November 2020, with a total of 68 participants with an age range between 24 and 77 years. Interviews and focus groups transcripts were coded with the ATLAS.ti CAQDAS. Few participants considered immunity certificates based on serological testing as an acceptable public health measure. Major concerns included the reliability of scientific data related to COVID-19 immunity and serological testing potential re-infection as well as the possibility that the use of certificates could result in deleterious outcomes. Discrimination, counterfeiting, incitement for self-infection, invasion of the private sphere, violation of personal integrity, and violation of medical secrecy were perceived as the major risks. Benefits of immunity certificates were more perceived when in relation to vaccination, and included gains in medical knowledge and protection in certain contexts involving leisure or work-related activities. The consequences of implementing immunity certificates are numerous, and the acceptability by the general population has to be considered when engaging in such policy. Even if the results provide a snapshot of arguments discussed around immunity certificates based on serological testing before the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccine, most of the issues discussed are central in the current debates about vaccination certificates."
2879,Early Differences in Cytokine Production by Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"Most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience asymptomatic disease or mild symptoms, but some have critical symptoms requiring intensive care. It is important to determine how patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 react to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and suppress virus spread. Innate immunity is important for evasion from the first virus attack, and it may play an important role in the pathogenesis in these patients. We measured serum cytokine levels in 95 patients with COVID-19 during the infection's acute phase and report that significantly higher interleukin 12 and 2 levels were induced in patients with asymptomatic or mild disease than in those with moderate or severe disease, indicating the key roles of these cytokines in the pathogenesis of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19."
