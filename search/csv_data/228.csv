2271,The Alpha Variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 in Children: First Experience from 3544 Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests in a Cohort of Children in Germany.,"In May 2021, the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 was found in 91% of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany. Not much is known about the symptoms, courses of disease, and infectiousness in pediatric patients with the Alpha variant. Objective: The aim of this retrospective analysis was to gain information on the infection with the Alpha variant in children and adolescents. Methods: Between 12 January 2021 and 3 June 2021, all nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) of children who received a swab for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Data were collected on standardized questionnaires. The analysis of data was anonymized and retrospective. Results: We investigated 3544 NAATs; 95 children were tested positive (2.7%) for SARS-CoV-2. For the sub-analysis, 65 children were analyzed. In 59 children, the Alpha variant was found (90.8%), and 54.2% (n = 32/59) were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and rhinitis. The median Ct value was 24.0 (min 17.0; max 32.7). Conclusions: We can underline early findings that children are still less effected by SARS-CoV-2 infection with the spread of the Alpha variant. We found no evidence that children infected with the Alpha variant showed more severe symptoms or suffered from a more severe clinical course than those infected with the wild type."
2272,A virtual ELISA to quantitate COVID-19 antibodies in patient serum.,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are used widely in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and clinical medicine labs. At the same time, they appear to be underrepresented in chemistry and biochemistry curricula, even though their sensitivity, selectivity, and ease of use would argue for their widespread use. We describe here an online ELISA activity suitable for stand-alone use or in conjunction with an actual wet lab ELISA. Specifically, we offer real and mock data for a hypothetical ELISA to detect plasma antibodies to COVID-19 in infected patients who have had the disease. Much of the activity focuses on chemical and mathematical models to fit ELISA or any macromolecule/ligand binding data, a skill that addresses perhaps the most relevant and difficult learning goal of an ELISA experiment."
2273,Exploring the Immunopathogenesis of Pregnancy With COVID-19 at the Vaccination Era.,"Since December 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pregnant women are deductively considered to be in immunosuppressive condition for the safety of semi-allograft fetuses, which increases the risk of being infected by the virus. In this review, we analyzed the unique immunological characteristics of pregnant women and reviewed their known outcomes at different trimesters from the perspective of underlying mechanisms that have been studied and speculated so far."

2275,"Diagnostic accuracy of three SARS-CoV2 antibody detection assays, neutralizing effect and longevity of serum antibodies.","Evidence is currently insufficient to know whether SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Abs) protect from future infection and how long immunity will last. The kinetics of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and role of serology in estimating individual protective immunity is yet to be established. We evaluated diagnostic performances of three serological assays - Abbott Architect CMIA IgG, bioMerieux VIDAS ELFA IgG/IgM, and Diesse Chorus ELISA IgG/IgM, and analyzed longevity and potential neutralizing effect of SARS-CoV-2 Abs in COVID-19 patients. Clinical sensitivities of assessed IgG tests two to three weeks post symptom onset (PSO) were very high: 96.77 % for Architect, 96.77 % for Chorus, and 100.00 % for VIDAS. Sensitivities of two assessed IgM assays were moderate: 74.07 % for Chorus, and 76.92 % for VIDAS. Specificities were excellent for all assessed IgG assays: 99.01 % for Architect and 100 % for Chorus and VIDAS. Chorus and VIDAS IgM assays also achieved excellent specificity of 99.01 % and 100 %, respectively. In most cases IgG Abs were still present eight months PSO. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in majority of serum samples from convalescent patients. Serum samples from severe COVID-19 patients had higher antibody titers and higher neutralizing activity. We observed a strong positive correlation among SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer and neutralizing activity. The strongest positive correlation to neutralizing activity was found for VIDAS IgG assay."
2276,Long-term antibody persistence and exceptional vaccination response on previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects.,"Background: The first COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed to the general population. However, the shortage of doses is slowing down the goal of reaching herd immunity. The aim of the study was to verify whether previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, a considerable portion of the population, should receive the same vaccination treatment of seronegative individuals. Methods: Health-professionals either recovered from COVID-19 or never infected by SARS-CoV-2 were serologically tested at different time-points right before, and several days after, vaccination. Results: Previously infected individuals showed humoral immune responses, 21 days after the first dose, that was approximately 10-folds higher than the seronegative group 21 days after the second dose. Seropositivity persists for at least 11 months. Conclusion: During a shortage of COVID-19 vaccine doses, previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals should be dispensed from the vaccination campaign. When dose availability returns to normality, injection of a single dose for seropositive individuals should be considered."
2277,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG seroconversion profiles among hospitalized patients in two US cities.,"The clinical and public health utility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologic testing requires a better understanding of the dynamics of the humoral response to infection. To track seroconversion of IgG and IgM antibodies in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and its association with patient and clinical factors and outcomes. Residual patient specimens were analyzed on the Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 instrument using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and prototype SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay. Age, sex, comorbidities, symptom onset date, mortality, and specimen collection date were obtained from electronic medical records. Three hundred fifty-nine longitudinal samples were collected from 89 hospitalized patients 0 to 82 days postsymptom onset. Of all, 51.7% of the patients developed IgG and IgM antibodies simultaneously; 32.8% seroconverted for IgM before IgG. On average, patients seroconverted for IgG by 8 days and for IgM by 7 days postsymptom onset. All patients achieved IgG seropositivity by 19 days and IgM seropositivity by 17 days. Median time to IgG and IgM seroconversion was prolonged and initial levels of IgG were lower in immunocompromised patients and patients <65 years of age compared to immune competent patients and those ≥65 years of age. Immunocompromised patients also had persistently lower levels of IgM that peaked on day 17.6 and decreased thereafter compared to immune competent patients. IgM seroconversion in patients who died reached significantly higher levels later after symptom onset than in those who recovered. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients have similar time to seroconversion for IgG and IgM. However, differences in immune status and age alter time to seroconversion. These results may help guide serologic testing application in COVID-19 management."
2278,SARS-CoV-2 screening in cancer outpatients during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic : Conclusions for crisis response at a high-volume oncology center.,"Background: During the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic Austria suffered one of the highest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rates worldwide. We report performance parameters of a SARS-CoV‑2 screening program established for cancer outpatients at our center. Methods: Institutional policy recommended routine biweekly SARS-CoV‑2 testing. Adherence to the testing recommendation during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between 1 October and 30 November 2020 was analyzed. The SARS-CoV‑2 infection rate during first wave period (21 March to 4 May 2020) was compared to the one during second wave. Results: A total of 1577 cancer patients were seen at our outpatient clinic during the second wave. In 1079/1577 (68.4%) patients, at least 1 SARS-CoV2 test was performed. Overall 2833 tests were performed, 23/1577 (1.5%, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.0-2.2%) patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV‑2, which indicates a significant increase compared to the first wave (4/1016; 0.4%, 95% CI 0.1-1.0%) with an odds ratio of 3.9 (95% CI 1.5-10.1; p < 0.005). Patients undergoing active anticancer treatment (172/960; 17.9% not tested) were more likely to have undergone a SARS-CoV‑2 test than patients in follow-up or best supportive care (326/617; 52.8% not tested p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with only 1 visit within 4 weeks were more likely to not have undergone a SARS-CoV‑2 test (386/598; 64.5%) compared to patients with 2 or more visits (112/979; 11.4%; p < 0.001). The projected number of patients with undetected SARS-CoV‑2 infection during the study period was 5. Conclusion: We identified clinical patient parameters influencing SARS-CoV‑2 testing coverage in cancer outpatients. Our data can provide information on generation of standard operating procedures and resource allocation during subsequent infection waves."
