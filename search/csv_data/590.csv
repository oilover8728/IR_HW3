5890,From influenza to COVID-19: Lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines at the frontiers of infectious diseases.,"Vaccination represents the best line of defense against infectious diseases and is crucial in curtailing pandemic spread of emerging pathogens to which a population has limited immunity. In recent years, mRNA vaccines have been proposed as the new frontier in vaccination, owing to their facile and rapid development while providing a safer alternative to traditional vaccine technologies such as live or attenuated viruses. Recent breakthroughs in mRNA vaccination have been through formulation with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which provide both protection and enhanced delivery of mRNA vaccines in vivo. In this review, current paradigms and state-of-the-art in mRNA-LNP vaccine development are explored through first highlighting advantages posed by mRNA vaccines, establishing LNPs as a biocompatible delivery system, and finally exploring the use of mRNA-LNP vaccines in vivo against infectious disease towards translation to the clinic. Furthermore, we highlight the progress of mRNA-LNP vaccine candidates against COVID-19 currently in clinical trials, with the current status and approval timelines, before discussing their future outlook and challenges that need to be overcome towards establishing mRNA-LNPs as next-generation vaccines. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: With the recent success of mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer against COVID-19, mRNA technology and lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have never received more attention. This manuscript timely reviews the most advanced mRNA-LNP vaccines that have just been approved for emergency use and are in clinical trials, with a focus on the remarkable development of several COVID-19 vaccines, faster than any other vaccine in history. We aim to give a comprehensive introduction of mRNA and LNP technology to the field of biomaterials science and increase accessibility to readers with a new interest in mRNA-LNP vaccines. We also highlight current limitations and future outlook of the mRNA vaccine technology that need further efforts of biomaterials scientists to address."
5891,"Hospitalizations Associated with COVID-19 Among Children and Adolescents - COVID-NET, 14 States, March 1, 2020-August 14, 2021.","Although COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths have occurred more frequently in adults,† COVID-19 can also lead to severe outcomes in children and adolescents (1,2). Schools are opening for in-person learning, and many prekindergarten children are returning to early care and education programs during a time when the number of COVID-19 cases caused by the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is increasing.§ Therefore, it is important to monitor indicators of severe COVID-19 among children and adolescents. This analysis uses Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET)¶ data to describe COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among U.S. children and adolescents aged 0-17 years. During March 1, 2020-August 14, 2021, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was 49.7 per 100,000 children and adolescents. The weekly COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate per 100,000 children and adolescents during the week ending August 14, 2021 (1.4) was nearly five times the rate during the week ending June 26, 2021 (0.3); among children aged 0-4 years, the weekly hospitalization rate during the week ending August 14, 2021, was nearly 10 times that during the week ending June 26, 2021.** During June 20-July 31, 2021, the hospitalization rate among unvaccinated adolescents (aged 12-17 years) was 10.1 times higher than that among fully vaccinated adolescents. Among all hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19, the proportions with indicators of severe disease (such as intensive care unit [ICU] admission) after the Delta variant became predominant (June 20-July 31, 2021) were similar to those earlier in the pandemic (March 1, 2020-June 19, 2021). Implementation of preventive measures to reduce transmission and severe outcomes in children is critical, including vaccination of eligible persons, universal mask wearing in schools, recommended mask wearing by persons aged ≥2 years in other indoor public spaces and child care centers,†† and quarantining as recommended after exposure to persons with COVID-19.§§."
5892,Management of pernio-like cutaneous manifestations in children during the outbreak of COVID-19.,"During the outbreak of COVID-19 many pernio-like lesions have been increasingly reported. The aim of the study is to describe our management of these skin manifestations and to evaluate a possible correlation to SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients underwent clinical and laboratory tests to detect a possible underlying connective disease and also to specific SARS-CoV-2 investigations such as oropharyngeal swab and IgG-IgM serology. Nine patients aged between 5 and 15 years old were evaluated. Skin lesions observed were purplish, erythematous and oedematous, in some cases painful and itchy. Six out of nine had respiratory and systemic symptoms (cough, nasal congestion, chills, fever, and asthenia) that preceded cutaneous findings of approximately 2 weeks. Concerning blood exams, three out of nine had D-dimer weakly increased, four had ANA positivity: two with a title 1:160, one with 1:320, and one with 1:5120 and a speckled pattern. The latter patient had also ENA SS-A positive and RF positivity, confirmed at a second check, so as to allow us to make a diagnosis of connective tissue disease. Four out of nine had aPL positivity (IgM). Reactants acute phase were all negative. Oropharyngeal swabs and serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (borderline in one patient for IgM). No treatment was needed. Even if we do not have enough data to prove it, we hypothesize a correlation between pernio-like lesions and SARS-CoV-2 infection for an increased number of these lesions described during the pandemic and also because such manifestations appeared when temperatures were mild and patients were at home in isolation for the lockdown. Many questions remain open about interaction host-virus."
5893,Viral epitope profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals cross-reactivity and correlates of severity.,"Understanding humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for improving diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Deep serological profiling of 232 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 190 pre-COVID-19 era controls using VirScan revealed more than 800 epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, including 10 epitopes likely recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Preexisting antibodies in controls recognized SARS-CoV-2 ORF1, whereas only COVID-19 patient antibodies primarily recognized spike protein and nucleoprotein. A machine learning model trained on VirScan data predicted SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity; a rapid Luminex-based diagnostic was developed from the most discriminatory SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Individuals with more severe COVID-19 exhibited stronger and broader SARS-CoV-2 responses, weaker antibody responses to prior infections, and higher incidence of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1, possibly influenced by demographic covariates. Among hospitalized patients, males produce stronger SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses than females."
5894,From Isolation to Containment: Perceived Fear of Infectivity and Protective Behavioral Changes during the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign.,"In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, maintenance of protective behavior is a continued challenge in the effort to contain the spread of the virus. A cross-sectional study via an internet questionnaire was utilized to elucidate changes in compliance to protective behavior among the Israeli population (n = 1120), after the beginning of the vaccination campaign. Comparison was made between individuals who were previously infected with the virus, those who received one dose of inoculation with the vaccine, and individuals that were neither infected or vaccinated. The study results indicate that those who were previously infected with the COVID-19 virus were less careful about mask wearing (18.8%) and social distancing (29.7%), as compared to the other examined groups (regarding mask wearing, 8.2% and 11.6% respectively, and with regard to social distancing 12.8% and 19.2%), and may require targeted risk communication campaigns to address this population. Furthermore, the study revealed that those that were non-Jewish (as compared to Jewish study counterparts) or that were older (19+) were more vigilant in their protective behavior (29.6% vs. 11.2% respectively for social distancing and 29.6% vs. 11.1% respectively for mask wearing). Despite a successful initial vaccination campaign in Israel, public health officials need to engage all members of the public to unremittingly observe compliance to directed health guidelines, to ensure that the results of previous governmental efforts in fighting the pandemic (such as lockdowns) will be effectively sustained, and the road to containment will be hastened."

5896,"The Spectrum of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Patients With Coronavirus Disease-19: Predictors, Relationship With Disease Severity, and Outcome.","Introduction: We prospectively studied the frequency, spectrum, and predictors of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms among patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and the relationship between GI symptoms and the severity and outcome. Methods: Consecutive patients with COVID-19, diagnosed in a university hospital referral laboratory in northern India, were evaluated for clinical manifestations including GI symptoms, their predictors, and the relationship between the presence of these symptoms, disease severity, and outcome on univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Of 16,317 subjects tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in their oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs during April-May 2020, 252 (1.5%) were positive. Of them, 208 (82.5%) were asymptomatic; of the 44 symptomatic patients, 18 (40.9%) had non-GI symptoms, 15 (34.1%) had a combination of GI and non-GI symptoms, and 11 (25.0%) had GI symptoms only. Thirty-three had mild-to-moderate disease, 8 severe, and 5 critical. Five patients (1.98%) died. On multivariate analysis, the factors associated with the presence of GI symptoms included the absence of contact history and presence of non-GI symptoms and comorbid illnesses. Patients with GI synptoms more often had severe, critical illness and fatal outcome than those without GI symptoms. Discussion: Eighty-two percent of patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic, and 10.3% had GI symptoms; severe and fatal disease occurred only in 5% and 2%, respectively. The presence of GI symptoms was associated with a severe illness and fatal outcome on multivariate analysis. Independent predictors of GI symptoms included the absence of contact history, presence of non-GI symptoms, and comorbid illnesses.(Equation is included in full-text article.)."

5899,"The semantic of a pandemic: Are cardiovascular patients dying ""with"" or ""from"" COVID-19? Reflections from a case report.","Rationale: Northern Italy has been particularly hit by the current Covid-19 pandemic. Italian deceased patients have a mean age of 78.5 years and only 1.2% have no comorbidities. These data started a public debate whether patients die ""with"" or ""from"" Covid-19. If on one hand the public opinion has been persuaded to believe that Covid-19 infection has poor outcomes just in elderly and/or fragile subjects, on the other hand, hospitals are admitting an increasing number of healthy young patients needing semi-intensive or intensive care units. Patient concerns: At the end of March 2020, a 79-year-old patient (M.G.) was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital with a 5 days history of fever, dyspnea, and cough. He was known for hypertension and coronary artery disease with a previous coronary artery stenting. Both the comorbidities were carried out without complications and the patient was previously asymptomatic and in good health. At admission, he was febrile and showed signs of respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypocapnia at blood gas analysis. Diagnosis: The day after, he was tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swab, which turned positive and a chest CT-Scan was consistent with the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia. Interventions: He was treated with i.v. diuretics, paracetamol, prolonged noninvasive ventilation (CPAP), and empiric antibiotic therapy on top of his chronic treatment. Outcomes: A treatment with heparin and corticosteroids was started; however, he developed irreversible respiratory failure. Invasive ventilation was not considered appropriate due to his comorbidities, low chances of recovery, and intensive care unit overcrowding. The patient died 9 days after admission. Lessons: Health conditions that are most reported as risk factors are common cardiovascular diseases that can be managed in modern clinical practice. Through a brief illustrative clinical case, we would like to underline how Covid-19 can be per se the cause of death in patients that would otherwise have had an acceptable life expectancy."
