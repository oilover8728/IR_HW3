1530,Open Science Resources for the Mass Spectrometry-Based Analysis of SARS-CoV-2.,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the causative agent of the 2020 pandemic leading to the COVID-19 respiratory disease. With many scientific and humanitarian efforts ongoing to develop diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatments for COVID-19, and to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, mass spectrometry research, including proteomics, is playing a role in determining the biology of this viral infection. Proteomics studies are starting to lead to an understanding of the roles of viral and host proteins during SARS-CoV-2 infection, their protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modifications. This is beginning to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets or diagnostic strategies that can be used to reduce the long-term burden of the pandemic. However, the extraordinary situation caused by the global pandemic is also highlighting the need to improve mass spectrometry data and workflow sharing. We therefore describe freely available data and computational resources that can facilitate and assist the mass spectrometry-based analysis of SARS-CoV-2. We exemplify this by reanalyzing a virus-host interactome data set to detect protein-protein interactions and identify host proteins that could potentially be used as targets for drug repurposing."
1531,[Patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spread in a megacity].,"The purpose of the study is to analyze patterns demonstrated by the COVID-19 epidemic process in a megacity during the increase, stabilization and reduction in the incidence, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the epidemic prevention measures. Materials and methods: The comprehensive study incorporating epidemiological, molecular genetic and statistical research methods was conducted to analyze the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Moscow during the COVID- 19 pandemic. Results and discussion: It was found that the exponential growth in COVID-19 cases was prevented due to the most stringent control and restrictive measures deployed in Moscow to break the chains of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and due to people who were very disciplined in complying with the self-isolation rules. The analysis of the dynamics in detection of new COVID-19 cases showed that in a megacity, the impact of social distancing and self-isolation would become apparent only after 3.5 incubation periods, where the maximum length of the period is 14 days. It was discovered that the detection frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in relatively healthy population and its dynamics are important monitoring parameters, especially during the increase and stabilization in the COVID-19 incidence, and are instrumental in predicting the development of the epidemic situation within a range of 1-2 incubation periods (14-28 days). In Moscow, the case fatality rate was 1.73% over the observation period (6/3/2020-23/6/2020). Conclusion: The epidemiological analysis of the COVID-19 situation in Moscow showed certain patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 spread and helped evaluate the effectiveness of the epidemic prevention measures aimed at breaking the routes of transmission of the pathogen."

1533,Lower respiratory tract samples are reliable for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid diagnosis and animal model study.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continue to impact countries worldwide. At present, inadequate diagnosis and unreliable evaluation systems hinder the implementation and development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Here, we conducted a horizontal and longitudinal study comparing the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in different types of samples collected from COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys. We also detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the above clinical and animal model samples to identify a reliable approach for the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results showed that, regardless of clinical symptoms, the highest detection levels of viral nucleic acid were found in sputum and tracheal brush samples, resulting in a high and stable diagnosis rate. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies were not detected in 6.90% of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, integration of nucleic acid detection results from the various sample types did not improve the diagnosis rate. Moreover, dynamic changes in SARS-CoV-2 viral load were more obvious in sputum and tracheal brushes than in nasal and throat swabs. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in sputum and tracheal brushes was the least affected by infection route, disease progression, and individual differences. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection using lower respiratory tract samples alone is reliable for COVID-19 diagnosis and study."
1534,Development of a multiplex Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay for on-site diagnosis of SARS CoV-2.,"A newly identified coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), has spread rapidly from its epicenter in China to more than 150 countries across six continents. In this study, we have designed three reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) primer sets to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid protein (N) genes of SARS CoV-2. For one tube reaction, the detection limits for five combination SARS CoV-2 LAMP primer sets (RdRP/E, RdRP/N, E/N, RdRP/E/N and RdRP/N/Internal control (actin beta)) were evaluated with a clinical nasopharyngeal swab sample. Among the five combination, the RdRP/E and RdRP/N/IC multiplex LAMP assays showed low detection limits. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay were evaluated and compared to that of the widely used Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Inc., Seoul, South Korea) and PowerChek™ 2019-nCoV Real-time PCR kit (Kogenebiotech, Seoul, South Korea) for 130 clinical samples from 91 SARS CoV-2 patients and 162 NP specimens from individuals with (72) and without (90) viral respiratory infections. The multiplex RdRP (FAM)/N (CY5)/IC (Hex) RT-LAMP assay showed comparable sensitivities (RdRP: 93.85%, N: 94.62% and RdRP/N: 96.92%) to that of the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (100%) and superior to those of PowerChek™ 2019-nCoV Real-time PCR kit (RdRP: 92.31%, E: 93.85% and RdRP/E: 95.38%)."
1535,A novel automated SARS-CoV-2 saliva PCR test protects a global asymptomatic workforce.,Regular PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic individuals for SARS-CoV-2 virus has become the established method by which health services are managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Businesses such as AstraZeneca have also prioritised voluntary asymptomatic testing to keep workplaces safe and maintain supply of essential medicines to patients. We describe the development of an internal automated SARS-CoV-2 testing programme including the transformative introduction of saliva as an alternative sample type.
1536,Three Cases of Subacute Thyroiditis Following SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine: Postvaccination ASIA Syndrome.,"Context: Autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome) can be seen as a postvaccination phenomenon that occurs after exposure to adjuvants in vaccines that increase the immune responses. There are very limited data regarding ASIA syndrome following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. Objectives: This work aims to report cases of subacute thyroiditis related to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Methods: We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of 3 cases of subacute thyroiditis after inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac®). Three female healthcare workers have applied to our clinic with anterior neck pain and fatigue 4 to 7 days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Two of them were in the breastfeeding period. They were negative for thyroid antibodies, and there was no previous history of thyroid disease, upper respiratory tract infection, or COVID-19. Laboratory test results and imaging findings were consistent with subacute thyroiditis. Results: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can lead to subacute thyroiditis as a phenomenon of ASIA syndrome. Subacute thyroiditis may develop within a few days after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Being in the postpartum period may be a facilitating factor for the development of ASIA syndrome after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Conclusions: This is the first report of subacute thyroiditis as a phenomenon of ASIA syndrome after inactivated COVID-19 vaccination. Clinicians should be aware that subacute thyroiditis may develop as a manifestation of ASIA syndrome after the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."
1537,"Playing Non-Professional Football in COVID-19 Time: A Narrative Review of Recommendations, Considerations, and Best Practices.","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 resulted in widespread interruption of team sports training and competitions. Our aim was to review the recommendations and best practices in return to play in non-professional football after activity lockdown. The authors searched two electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science) to extract studies published before September 15 2020. Twenty studies explained recommendations, considerations, or best practices in return to play in football, and all of them were clustered into three groups: (1) training load management (n = 10), (2) medical recommendations (n = 9), and (3) recovery related issues (n = 5). The way to establish a progression in training process should be based on training load management and managing the number of stimuli per time. Following the studies, this training process should be divided into three phases: phase 1-physical distancing should be maintained; phases 2 and 3-group training should start. Medical considerations were clustered into different groups: general, pre- and post- training, during training, education, planning to return to competition, and suggestions for post confinement weeks. In particular, social issues, strict hygiene questions, and continuous PCR testing should be considered in return to play over football season. Finally, since a correlation has been found between high-intensive training loads and immunoglobulin A, nutritional and lifestyle recovery strategies should be performed. Moreover, since immunosuppression has been related to congested schedules (<72 h between matches), football federations should avoid this situation."
1538,"A Web-Based Platform on Coronavirus Disease-19 to Maintain Predicted Diagnostic, Drug, and Vaccine Candidates.","A web-based resource CoronaVIR (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/coronavir/) has been developed to maintain the predicted and existing information on coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have integrated multiple modules, including ""Genomics,"" ""Diagnosis,"" ""Immunotherapy,"" and ""Drug Designing"" to understand the holistic view of this pandemic medical disaster. The genomics module provides genomic information of different strains of this virus to understand genomic level alterations. The diagnosis module includes detailed information on currently-in-use diagnostics tests as well as five novel universal primer sets predicted using in silico tools. The Immunotherapy module provides information on epitope-based potential vaccine candidates (e.g., LQLPQGTTLPKGFYA, VILLNKHIDAYKTFPPTEPKKDKKKK, EITVATSRTLS, GKGQQQQGQTV, SELVIGAVILR) predicted using state-of-the-art software and resources in the field of immune informatics. These epitopes have the potential to activate both adaptive (e.g., B cell and T cell) and innate (e.g., vaccine adjuvants) immune systems as well as suitable for all strains of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, we have also predicted potential candidates for siRNA-based therapy and RNA-based vaccine adjuvants. The drug designing module maintains information about potential drug targets, tertiary structures, and potential drug molecules. These potential drug molecules were identified from FDA-approved drugs using the docking-based approach. We also compiled information from the literature and Internet on potential drugs, repurposing drugs, and monoclonal antibodies. To understand host-virus interaction, we identified cell-penetrating peptides in the virus. In this study, state-of-the-art techniques have been used for predicting the potential candidates for diagnostics and therapeutics."
1539,"Occupational Characteristics and Management Measures of Sporadic COVID-19 Outbreaks From June 2020 to January 2021 in China: The Importance of Tracking Down ""Patient Zero"".","There are occupational disparities in the risk of contracting COVID-19. Occupational characteristics and work addresses play key roles in tracking down ""patient zero."" The present descriptive analysis for occupational characteristics and management measures of sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks from June to December 2020 in China offers important new information to the international community at this stage of the pandemic. These data suggest that Chinese measures including tracking down ""patient zero,"" launching mass COVID-19 testing in the SARS-CoV-2-positive areas, designating a new high- or medium-risk area, locking down the corresponding community or neighborhood in response to new COVID-19 cases, and basing individual methods of protection on science are effective in reducing the transmission of the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 across China."
