4170,Epitope-Based Potential Vaccine Candidate for Humoral and Cell-Mediated Immunity to Combat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pandemic.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome from novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has put an immense pressure worldwide where vaccination is believed to be an efficient way for developing hard immunity. Herein, we employ immunoinformatic tools to identify B-cell, T-cell epitopes associated with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is important for genome release. The results showed that the highly immunogenic epitopes located at the stalk part are mostly conserved compared to the receptor binding domain (RDB). Further, two vaccine candidates were computationally modeled from the linear B-cell, T-cell epitopes. Molecular docking reveals the crucial interactions of the vaccines with immune-receptors, and their stability is assessed by MD simulation studies. The chimeric vaccines showed remarkable binding affinity toward the immune cell receptors computed by the MM/PBSA method. van der Waals and electrostatic interactions are found to be the dominant factors for the stability of the complexes. The molecular-level interaction obtained from this study may provide deeper insight into the process of vaccine development against the pandemic of COVID-19."
4171,Are COVID-19 test results masking important issues?,"Basic health and infection control measures are the main methods of protection against COVID-19. Patients are well informed about how practitioners should be conducting themselves, however, they may lose trust in clinicians who fail to demonstrate, and promote those same basic prevention measures. The broader COVID-19 strategy has included the rapid development and deployment of swabs and antibody tests. Flaws in testing fail to offer assurances due to false negatives while even true positives cannot guarantee future immunity as there is uncertainty regarding long-term antibody response. An understanding of human factors and an appreciation of the limitations of available tests could offer healthcare staff mechanisms to encourage safety."
4172,Urgent need of rapid tests for SARS CoV-2 antigen detection: Evaluation of the SD-Biosensor antigen test for SARS-CoV-2.,"At the time of writing, FIND has listed four CE-marked SARSCoV-2 antigen tests. We evaluated the recently CE-approved rapid POCT SD-Biosensor for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein detection in nasopharyngeal secretions from 330 patients admitted to the Emergency Room for a suspect of COVID-19 and travelers returning home from high risk countries. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative and predictive values were consistent with the use of the test to mass-screening for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance."

4174,Coronavirus disease 2019: update on coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes and vaccine efficacy in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease.,"Purpose of review: Although the literature to date on COVID-19 outcomes in those with immune-mediated inflammatory disease has been largely reassuring there remain many unanswered questions. These include the impact of specific medications on outcomes and the antibody response after COVID-19 vaccination. Recent findings: We summarized the current literature related to COVID-19 outcomes in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, dermatology, and neurology. Overall, we found either no difference or modest differences in risk for severe COVID-19 for people with immune-mediated diseases compared with the general population. When considering disease-specific factors, glucocorticoid use and underlying immune-mediated disease activity were generally associated with worse outcomes. Specific medications varied in associations: tumor necrosis factor inhibitors generally had lower odds for severe COVID-19 outcomes, whereas rituximab use generally had higher odds for severe outcomes. We also detailed the recent reports of antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination in people with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Summary: Investigations of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases across several organ systems have offered important insight into the COVID-19 disease course. Overall, these studies have provided reassurance to patients and clinicians while also identifying groups who may be at higher risk for poor outcomes."

4176,Willingness to Be Vaccinated against COVID-19 in Spain before the Start of Vaccination: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Vaccine hesitancy has increased in the past few years, influenced by the socio-cultural differences, political populism, or concerns related to the effectiveness and safety of some vaccines, resulting a feeling of distrust. This feeling can become a barrier against the achievement of the immunity necessary to stop the expansion of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 in Spain, as well as to identify the factors that have an influence on the concerns and attitudes of people against accepting the vaccine in the months prior to the start of vaccination on December 2020. An online questionnaire was created to obtain information about (1) sociodemographic characteristics; (2) concerns and sources of information about vaccines; and (3) attitudes about vaccination and state of health. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors. Of the 2501 participants, 1207 (48.3%) would accept the COVID-19 vaccine, 623 (24.9%) were hesitant, and 671 (26.8%) would reject it. The logistic regression showed that being male, older than 60, married, retired, with a high level of education, or with a leftist political inclination, could increase the probability of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine. Disinformation and the lack of political consensus were the main sources of distrust. The patients with hypertension, immunodepression, hypercholesterolemia, or respiratory disease, or were overweight, showed a greater acceptance to the vaccine, while those with cancer took the longest to accept it. A low acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 was observed among the Spanish population in the phase prior to its availability, and the main fears of the population were identified. It is necessary to offer correct and transparent information about these vaccines to reduce the concerns and increase the trust of the population, to thereby guarantee the success of the vaccination campaigns."
4177,[SARS coronavirus-2 vaccines: options and state-of-the-art].,"Since the first reports in mid-January of a serious new viral respiratory infection, COVID-19, and the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of this disease, researchers work intensely on developing a vaccine that can protect individuals against serious disease and that can limit the spread of the virus. Vaccine developers are using a range of platform technologies to do this, each with advantages and disadvantages. Close to 30 vaccines are now in clinical testing. The first results are encouraging, but in order to properly assess the merits of the different vaccines, we must wait for the results of phase 3 trials. The first phase 3 trials have started in July 2020."
4178,Comparison of commercial assays and laboratory developed tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rapid development of tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are required to assess the relative performance of different assays. Here, we compared the performance of two commercial assays, the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics) and Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid®) tests, and a laboratory developed RT-PCR test adapted for use on the Hologic® Panther Fusion® (Hologic®) instrument as well as Bio-Rad and QIAGEN real-time PCR detection systems. Performance characteristics for each test were determined by testing clinical specimens and reference material. All assays detect the pan-Sarbecovirus E (envelope structural protein) gene plus a SARS-CoV-2-specific target. The limit of detection for the E gene target varied from ∼2 copies/reaction to >30 copies/reaction. Due to assay-specific differences in sample processing and nucleic acid extraction, the overall analytical sensitivity ranged from 24 copies/mL specimen to 574 copies/mL specimen. Despite these differences, there was 100 % agreement between the commercial and laboratory developed tests. No false-negative or false-positive SARS-CoV-2 results were observed and there was no cross-reactivity with common respiratory viruses, including endemic coronaviruses."
4179,"A multi-family cluster of COVID-19 associated with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission in Jixi City, Heilongjiang, China, 2020.","We investigated a multi-family cluster of 22 cases in Jixi, where pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission resulted in at least 41% of household infections of SARS-CoV-2. Our study illustrates the challenge of controlling COVID-19 due to the presence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission even when extensive testing and contact tracing are conducted."
