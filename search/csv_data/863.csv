8620,Immunological imprinting of the antibody response in COVID-19 patients.,"In addition to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), humans are also susceptible to six other coronaviruses, for which consecutive exposures to antigenically related and divergent seasonal coronaviruses are frequent. Despite the prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing research, the nature of the antibody response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. Here we longitudinally profile the early humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and quantify levels of pre-existing immunity to OC43, HKU1 and 229E seasonal coronaviruses, and find a strong back-boosting effect to conserved but not variable regions of OC43 and HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike protein. However, such antibody memory boost to human coronaviruses negatively correlates with the induction of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein. Our findings thus provide evidence of immunological imprinting by previous seasonal coronavirus infections that can potentially modulate the antibody profile to SARS-CoV-2 infection."
8621,Neuropilin-1: A feasible link between liver pathologies and COVID-19.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has a tremendous impact on the health of millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately, those suffering from previous pathological conditions are more vulnerable and tend to develop more severe disease upon infection with the new SARS-CoV-2. This coronavirus interacts with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor to invade the cells. Recently, another receptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), has been reported to amplify the viral infection. Interestingly, NRP-1 is expressed in nonparenchymal liver cells and is related to and upregulated in a wide variety of liver-related pathologies. It has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes liver injury through several pathways that may be influenced by the previous pathological status of the patient and liver expression of NRP-1. Moreover, coronavirus disease 2019 causes an inflammatory cascade called cytokine storm in patients with severe disease. This cytokine storm may influence liver sinusoidal-cell phenotype, facilitating viral invasion. In this review, the shreds of evidence linking NRP-1 with liver pathologies such as hepatocellular carcinoma, liver fibrosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and inflammatory disorders are discussed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the involvement of the infection-related cytokine storm in NRP-1 overexpression and the subsequent increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection are also analyzed. This review aims to shed some light on the involvement of liver NRP-1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and emphasizes the possible involvement this receptor with the observed liver damage."
8622,Vaginal delivery report of a healthy neonate born to a convalescent mother with COVID--19.,The outbreak of the infection of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID--19) has become a challenging public health threat worldwide. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. We report a case of a convalescing pregnant woman diagnosed with COVID-19 infection 37 days before delivery in the third trimester. A live birth without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was performed successfully via the vagina. The findings from our case indicate that there is no intrauterine transmission in this woman who developed COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.

8624,COVID-19 and comorbidities: Deleterious impact on infected patients.,"The pandemic situation with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from China has endangered human lives. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is presented with asymptomatic, mild, or severe pneumonia-like symptoms. COVID-19 patients with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), hypertension, malignancies, HIV, and other comorbidities could develop a life-threatening situation. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE-2 receptors found at the surface of the host cells to get inside the cell. Certain comorbidities are associated with a strong ACE-2 receptor expression and higher release of proprotein convertase that enhances the viral entry into the host cells. The comorbidities lead to the COVID-19 patient into a vicious infectious circle of life and are substantially associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The comorbid individuals must adopt the vigilant preventive measure and require scrupulous management. In this review, we rigorously focused on the impact of common morbidities in COVID-19 patients and recapitulated the management strategies with recent directions. We found limited resources describing the association of comorbidities in COVID-19; however, our review delineates the broader spectrum of comorbidities with COVID-19 patients."
8625,A Canadian perspective on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and treatment: how prevalent underlying inflammatory disease contributes to pathogenesis.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a serious respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged as a global pandemic. Canada reported its first case of COVID-19 on the 25th January 2020. By March 2020, the virus had spread within Canadian communities reaching the most frail and vulnerable elderly population in long-term care facilities. The majority of cases were reported in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia, and the highest mortality was seen among individuals aged 65 years or older. Canada has the highest prevalence and incidence rates of several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and Parkinson's disease. Many elderly Canadians also live with comorbid medical illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease, and are more likely to suffer from severe COVID-19 with a poor prognosis. It is becoming increasingly evident that underlying inflammatory disease contributes to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review the mechanisms behind SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the host inflammatory responses that lead to resolution or progression to severe COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, we discuss the landscape of COVID-19 therapeutics that are currently in development in Canada."
8626,Influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: a review from the climate change perspective.,"Ever since the global outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) in the early part of 2020, there is no doubt that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has placed great tension globally and has affected almost all aspects of human endeavors. There are presently several research studies on the atmospheric environmental and economic effects of this dreaded virus. Supposedly, the responses ought to have also present innovations that would advance scientific research to mitigate its impacts since most of the ensuing consequences impact the atmospheric climatic conditions. Even when it appears that economic events would possibly return in no time, the circumstances will change. Specifically, from the existing literature, it appears that not much has been done to study the influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on climate change. Hence, this present review article will explore the possible connection between the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and climate change. The utilization of various scientific domains for climate change studies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and exploring the positive influences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and measures to avoid the negative impacts on climate change owing to SARS-CoV-2 have also been discussed."
8627,Norwich COVID-19 testing initiative pilot: evaluating the feasibility of asymptomatic testing on a university campus.,"Background: There is a high prevalence of COVID-19 in university-age students, who are returning to campuses. There is little evidence regarding the feasibility of universal, asymptomatic testing to help control outbreaks in this population. This study aimed to pilot mass COVID-19 testing on a university research park, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of scaling up testing to all staff and students. Methods: This was a cross-sectional feasibility study on a university research park in the East of England. All staff and students (5625) were eligible to participate. All participants were offered four PCR swabs, which they self-administered over two weeks. Outcome measures included uptake, drop-out rate, positivity rates, participant acceptability measures, laboratory processing measures, data collection and management measures. Results: 798 (76%) of 1053 who registered provided at least one swab; 687 (86%) provided all four; 792 (99%) of 798 who submitted at least one swab had all negative results and 6 participants had one inconclusive result. There were no positive results. 458 (57%) of 798 participants responded to a post-testing survey, demonstrating a mean acceptability score of 4.51/5, with five being the most positive. Conclusions: Repeated self-testing for COVID-19 using PCR is feasible and acceptable to a university population."
8628,"Leaving no stone unturned in light of the COVID-19 faecal-oral hypothesis? A water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) perspective targeting low-income countries.","The human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic. Social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment dominate the current fight against COVID-19. In developing countries, the need for clean water provision, sanitation and hygiene has only received limited attention. The current perspective examines the latest evidence on the occurrence, persistence and faecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent causing COVID-19. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 proliferate in the human gastrointestinal system, and is shed via faeces. SARS-CoV-2 can survive and remain viable for up to 6 to 9 days on surfaces. Recent wastewater-based epidemiological studies from several countries also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewaters. Shell disorder analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rigid outer shell conferring resilience, and a low shell disorder conferring moderate potential for faecal-oral transmission. Taken together, these findings point to potential faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which may partly explain its rapid transmission. Three potential mechanisms may account for SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission: (1) untreated contaminated drinking water, (2) raw and poorly cooked marine and aquatic foods from contaminated sources, (3) raw wastewater-based vegetatble production systems (e.g., salads) and aquaculture, and (4) vector-mediated transmission from faecal sources to foods, particularly those from open markets and street vending. SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission could be particularly high in developing countries due to several risk factors, including; (1) poor drinking water, wastewater and sanitation infrastructure, (2) poor hygiene and food handling practices, (3) unhygienic and rudimentary funeral practices, including home burials close to drinking water sources, and (4) poor social security and health care systems with low capacity to cope with disease outbreaks. Hence, clean drinking water provision, proper sanitation, food safety and hygiene could be critical in the current fight against COVID-19. Future research directions on COVID-19 faecal-oral transmission are highlighted."
