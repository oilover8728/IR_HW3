5730,Comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor ACE2 with evolutionarily related coronaviruses.,"The pandemic COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it is spreading very rapidly worldwide. To date, the origin and intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. In this study, we conducted comparative analysis among SARS-CoV-2 and non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains to elucidate their phylogenetic relationships. We found: 1, the SARS-CoV-2 strains analyzed could be divided into 3 clades with regional aggregation; 2, the non-SARS-CoV-2 common coronaviruses that infect humans or other organisms to cause respiratory syndrome and epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis could also be divided into 3 clades; 3, the hosts of the common coronaviruses closest to SARS-CoV-2 were Apodemus chevrieri (a rodent), Delphinapterus leucas (beluga whale), Hypsugo savii (bat) , Camelus bactrianus (camel) and Mustela vison (mink); and 4, the gene sequences of the receptor ACE2 from different hosts could also be divided into 3 clades. The ACE2 gene sequences closest to that of humans in evolution include those from Nannospalax galili (Upper Galilee mountains blind mole rat), Phyllostomus discolor (pale spear-nosed bat), Mus musculus (house mouse), Delphinapterus leucas (beluga whale), and Catharus ustulatus (Swainson's thrush). We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved from a distant common ancestor with the common coronaviruses but not a branch of any of them, implying that the prevalent pandemic COVID-19 agent SARS-CoV-2 may have existed in a yet to be identified primary host for a long time."
5731,The Allplex 2019-nCoV (Seegene) assay: which performances are for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis?,"Several commercial assays for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR are available but few of them were assessed. We evaluate the Allplex 2019-nCoV (Seegene) assay using 41 nasopharyngeal samples. The rates of agreement were 92.7% and 100% with the GeneFinder COVID-19 plus (Elitech) and the diagnosis of the infectious disease specialist respectively. Four samples display a Ct < 22.0 for the E and RdRp genes while the N gene was not detected, suggesting a variability of the viral sequence. There was no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses. The Allplex 2019-nCoV appears as a reliable method, but additional evaluations using more samples are needed. RT-PCR assays should probably include at least 2 viral targets."
5732,Repurposing of clinically approved drugs for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in a 2019-novel coronavirus-related coronavirus model.,"Background: Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those institutions without such facilities or 2019-nCoV. This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus model. Methods: A 2019-nCoV-related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2V uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2V infection. The anti-viral activities and anti-viral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. Results: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs, including cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride, exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 μmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP had potent anti-viral activities against both viral entry (0.46 ± 0.12, vs.1.00 ± 0.37, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication ([6.18 ± 0.95] × 10vs. 1.00 ± 0.43, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and further study of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted."
5733,"Mental disorders, psychopharmacological treatments, and mortality in 2150 COVID-19 Spanish inpatients.","Objective: To determine how mental disorders and psychopharmacological treatments before and during COVID-19 hospital admissions are related to mortality. Methods: Subjects included in the study were all adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, confirmed clinically and by PCR, who were admitted to a tertiary university hospital in Badalona (Spain) between March 1 and November 17, 2020. Data were extracted anonymously from computerized clinical records. Results: 2,150 subjects were included, 57% males, mean age 61 years. History of mental disorders was registered in 957 (45%). Throughout admission, de novo diagnosis of mood or anxiety, stress, or adjustment disorder was made in 12% of patients without previous history. Delirium was diagnosed in 10% of cases. 1011 patients (47%) received a psychotropic prescription during admission (36% benzodiazepines, 22% antidepressants, and 21% antipsychotics). Mortality rate was 17%. Delirium during admission and history of mood disorder were independently associated with higher mortality risk (hazard ratios, 1.39 and 1.52 respectively), while previous year's treatments with anxiolytics/hypnotics and antidepressants were independently associated with lower mortality risk (hazard ratios, 0.47 and 0.43, respectively). Conclusion: Mental symptoms are very common in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Detecting, diagnosing, and treating them is key to determining the prognosis of the disease and functional recovery."
5734,"Delayed positive COVID19 nasopharyngeal test, a case study with clinical and pathological correlation.","Background: There are various reasons for delayed positive nasopharyngeal PCR tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) in not only asymptomatic but also severely diseased patients. The pathophysiological attributes are not known. We explore this possibility through a case report. Case presentation: A 64-year-old male with history of pulmonary fungal infection, asthma and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD), diabetes, coronary artery disease presented with shortness of breath, fever and chest image of ground opacity, reticular interstitial thickening, highly suspicious for COVID19. However, nasopharyngeal swab tests were discordantly negative for four times in two weeks, and IgG antibody for COVID19 was also negative. However, serum IgE level was elevated. No other pathogens are identified. His symptoms deteriorated despite corticosteroid, antibiotics and bronchodilator treatment. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and open lung wedge biopsy were performed for etiology diagnosis. They demonstrated COVID19 viral RNA positive fibrosing organizing pneumonia with respiratory tract damage characterized by suspicious viral cytopathic effect, mixed neutrophilic, lymphoplasmacytic, histiocytic and eosinophilic inflammation and fibrosis besides expected asthma and COPD change. One week later, repeated COVID19 nasopharyngeal tests on day 40 and day 49 became positive. Conclusion: Our case and literature review indicate that allergic asthma and associated high IgE level together with corticosteroid inhalation might contribute to the delayed positive nasopharyngeal swab in upper airway; COPD related chronic airways obstruction and the addition of fibrosis induced ventilator dependence and poor prognosis in COVID19 pneumonia, and should be therapeutically targeted besides antiviral therapy."

5736,Infrared Based Saliva Screening Test for COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an unprecedented need for diagnostic testing that is critical in controlling the spread of COVID-19. We propose a portable infrared spectrometer with purpose-built transflection accessory for rapid point-of-care detection of COVID-19 markers in saliva. Initially, purified virion particles were characterized with Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron infrared (IR) and AFM-IR. A data set comprising 171 transflection infrared spectra from 29 subjects testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR and 28 testing negative, was modeled using Monte Carlo Double Cross Validation with 50 randomized test and model sets. The testing sensitivity was 93 % (27/29) with a specificity of 82 % (23/28) that included positive samples on the limit of detection for RT-qPCR. Herein, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept high throughput infrared COVID-19 test that is rapid, inexpensive, portable and utilizes sample self-collection thus minimizing the risk to healthcare workers and ideally suited to mass screening."
5737,Testing IgG antibodies against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is sufficient and necessary for COVID-19 diagnosis.,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the fast global spread of the disease resulted in unprecedented decline in world trade and travel. A critical priority is, therefore, to quickly develop serological diagnostic capacity and identify individuals with past exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In this study serum samples obtained from 309 persons infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 324 of healthy, uninfected individuals as well as serum from 7 COVID-19 patients with 4-7 samples each ranging between 1-92 days post first positive PCR were tested by an ""in house"" ELISA which detects IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Sensitivity of 47%, 80% and 88% and specificity of 100%, 98% and 98% in detection of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies, respectively, were observed. IgG antibody levels against the RBD were demonstrated to be up regulated between 1-7 days after COVID-19 detection, earlier than both IgM and IgA antibodies. Study of the antibody kinetics of seven COVID 19 patients revealed that while IgG levels are high and maintained for at least 3 months, IgM and IgA levels decline after a 35-50 days following infection. Altogether, these results highlight the usefulness of the RBD based ELISA, which is both easy and cheap to prepare, to identify COVID-19 patients even at the acute phase. Most importantly our results demonstrate that measuring IgG levels alone is both sufficient and necessary to diagnose past exposure to SARS-CoV-2."
5738,Problematic Covid-19 vaccine trials in times of vaccine nationalism.,"Thanks to an impressive R&D effort, three vaccines for Covid-19 have been conditionally approved by stringent regulators as of February 2021, and sixteen have entered the WHO evaluation process. However, they all need to keep on being evaluated in clinical trials. The WHO Ad Hoc Expert Group on the Next Steps for Covid-19 Vaccine suggested that countries with limited or no access to an effective vaccine could ethically permit placebo-controlled trials, even if effective vaccines were already being marketed elsewhere. Here, I argue that inclusion in a placebo-controlled trial is ethically sound for those who would be in any case ineligible for vaccination outside the trial, and as long as the access to the vaccine outside the trial depends on a transparent and just allocation framework. Conversely, carrying out placebo-controlled studies in countries where vaccines are not (or are insufficiently) available because of unequal global allocation, would be unethical, as an ethical strategy cannot be built on an unethical premise."
5739,Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Analysis of Public Attitudes on Facebook and Twitter Toward COVID-19 Vaccines in the United Kingdom and the United States: Observational Study.,"Background: Global efforts toward the development and deployment of a vaccine for COVID-19 are rapidly advancing. To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence-based approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning-based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. Results: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence-enabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake."
