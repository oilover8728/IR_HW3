1230,Viral Replication and Antibody Kinetics in the Recognition of Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients.,"Following the discovery of COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, different studies have been carried out to recognize the stages of the disease and the methods of achieving correct diagnosis. Investigations of cases and their contacts have revealed different degrees in the symptomatology of the disease, with asymptomatic patients gaining relevance because of the controversy regarding their role in the spread of the disease. Recognition and assessment of asymptomatic patients is essential to carry out containment actions such as public health measures for affected patients and contacts. In this review, we assess the diagnostic aspects of asymptomatic patients according to the available evidence of people with COVID-19."
1231,Broad-Spectrum Anti-coronavirus Vaccines and Therapeutics to Combat the Current COVID-19 Pandemic and Future Coronavirus Disease Outbreaks.,"While the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is continuing, it may become worse in the coming winter months with a high potential for the emergence and spread of escape variants of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) from bats may also cause outbreaks of emerging coronavirus diseases in the future. These predictions call for the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic and future emerging coronavirus disease epidemics. In this review, we describe advances and challenges in the development of broad-spectrum vaccines and neutralizing antibodies against lineage B betacoronaviruses (β-CoV-Bs), including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and SARSr-CoVs, as well as peptide-based pan-CoV fusion inhibitors and their potential in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and other human coronavirus infections."
1232,A Guide to COVID-19: a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain of the human coronavirus has thrown the world into the midst of a new pandemic. In the human body, the virus causes COVID-19, a disease characterized by shortness of breath, fever, and pneumonia, which can be fatal in vulnerable individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics of past human coronaviruses, with close genomic similarities to SARS-CoV, the virus that causes the disease SARS. Like these related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the inhalation of droplets and interaction with contaminated surfaces. Across the world, laboratories are developing candidate vaccines for the virus - with vaccine trials underway in the United States and the United Kingdom - and considering various drugs for possible treatments and prophylaxis. Here, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its virology, epidemiology, and modes of transmission while examining the current progress of testing procedures and possible treatments through drugs and vaccines."

1234,"Epidemiologic Features, Radiological Findings andClinical Outcomes of 19 Patients with COVID-19in a Single Center in Beijing, China.","ObjectiveTo describe the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and prognoses of COVID-19 confirmed patients in a single center in Beijing, China. Methods The study retrospectively included 19 patients with nucleic acid-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at our hospital from January 20 to March 5, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 14, 2020. The epidemiologic and clinical information was obtained through direct communication with the patients or their family members. Laboratory results retrieved from medical records and radiological images were analyzed both qualitatively by two senior chest radiologists as well as quantitatively via an artificial intelligence software. Results We identified 5 family clusters (13/19, 68.4%) from the study cohort. All cases had good clinical prognoses and were either mild (3/19) or moderate (16/19) clinical types. Fever (15/19, 78.9%) and dry cough (11/19, 57.9%) were common symptoms. Two patients received negative results for more than three consecutive viral nucleic acid tests. The longest interval between an initial CT abnormal finding and a confirmed diagnosis was 30 days. One patient's nucleic acid test turned positive on the follow-up examination after discharge. The presence of radiological abnormalities was non-specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Conclusions COVID-19 patients with mild or no clinical symptoms are common in Beijing, China. Radiological abnormalities are mostly non-specific and massive CT examinations for COVID-19 screening should be avoided. Analyses of the contact histories of diagnosed cases in combination with clinical, radiological and laboratory findings are crucial for the early detection of COVID-19. Close monitoring after discharge is also recommended."
1235,Patterns and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Chicago to monitor COVID-19 exposure.,"BACKGROUNDEstimates of seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 vary widely and may influence vaccination response. We ascertained IgG levels across a single US metropolitan site, Chicago, from June 2020 through December 2020.METHODSParticipants (n = 7935) were recruited through electronic advertising and received materials for a self-sampled dried-blood spot assay through the mail or a minimal contact in-person method. IgG against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was measured using an established highly sensitive and highly specific assay.RESULTSOverall seroprevalence was 17.9%, with no significant difference between method of contact. Only 2.5% of participants reported having had a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on virus detection, consistent with a 7-fold greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 measured by serology than that detected by viral testing. The range of IgG level observed in seropositive participants from this community survey overlapped with the range of IgG levels associated with COVID-19 cases having a documented positive PCR test. From a subset of those who participated in repeat testing, half of seropositive individuals retained detectable antibodies for 3 to 4 months.CONCLUSIONQuantitative IgG measurements with a highly specific and sensitive assay indicated more widespread exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than observed by viral testing. The range of IgG concentrations produced from these asymptomatic exposures was similar to IgG levels occurring after documented nonhospitalized COVID-19, which were considerably lower than those produced from hospitalized COVID-19 cases. The differing ranges of IgG response, coupled with the rate of decay of antibodies, may influence response to subsequent viral exposure and vaccine.FundingNational Science Foundation grant 2035114, NIH grant 3UL1TR001422-06S4, NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences grants UL1 TR001422 and UL1 TR002389, Dixon Family Foundation, Northwestern University Cancer Center (NIH grant P30 CA060553), and Walder Foundation's Chicago Coronavirus Assessment Network."
1236,Estimating infectiousness throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection course.,"Two elementary parameters for quantifying viral infection and shedding are viral load and whether samples yield a replicating virus isolate in cell culture. We examined 25,381 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Germany, including 6110 from test centers attended by presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and mildly symptomatic (PAMS) subjects, 9519 who were hospitalized, and 1533 B.1.1.7 lineage infections. The viral load of the youngest subjects was lower than that of the older subjects by 0.5 (or fewer) log10 units, and they displayed an estimated ~78% of the peak cell culture replication probability; in part this was due to smaller swab sizes and unlikely to be clinically relevant. Viral loads above 109 copies per swab were found in 8% of subjects, one-third of whom were PAMS, with a mean age of 37.6 years. We estimate 4.3 days from onset of shedding to peak viral load (108.1 RNA copies per swab) and peak cell culture isolation probability (0.75). B.1.1.7 subjects had mean log10 viral load 1.05 higher than that of non-B.1.1.7 subjects, and the estimated cell culture replication probability of B.1.1.7 subjects was higher by a factor of 2.6."
1237,Evaluation of Nutrition Risk and Its Association With Mortality Risk in Severely and Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients.,"Background: The nutrition status of coronavirus disease 2019 patients is unknown. This study evaluates clinical and nutrition characteristics of severely and critically ill patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and investigates the relationship between nutrition risk and clinical outcomes. Methods: A retrospective, observational study was conducted at West Campus of Union Hospital in Wuhan. Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by a nucleic acid-positive test and identified as severely or critically ill were enrolled in this study. Clinical data and outcomes information were collected and nutrition risk was assessed using Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS). Results: In total, 413 patients were enrolled in this study, including 346 severely and 67 critically ill patients. Most patients, especially critically ill patients, had significant changes in nutrition-related parameters and inflammatory markers. As for nutrition risk, the critically ill patients had significantly higher proportion of high NRS scores (P < .001), which were correlated with inflammatory and nutrition-related markers. Among 342 patients with NRS score ≥3, only 84 (of 342, 25%) received nutrition support. Critically ill patients and those with higher NRS score had a higher risk of mortality and longer stay in hospital. In logistic regression models, 1-unit increase in NRS score was associated with the risk of mortality increasing by 1.23 times (adjusted odds ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.10-4.51; P = .026). Conclusions: Most severely and critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at nutrition risk. The patients with higher nutrition risk have worse outcome and require nutrition therapy."
1238,"Effect of SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening on participants' attitudes and behaviour: a study of industry workers in Split, Croatia.","Objectives: To investigate the changes in personal attitudes and behaviour before and after negative serological test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. Study design: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Methods: A survey questionnaire was conducted with 200 industry workers (68% males and 32% females) who had previously tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The survey examined participants' self-reported general attitudes towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their sense of fear, as well as their behaviour towards protective measures before and after the testing. Results: Participants perceived the disease as a severe health threat and acknowledged that the protective measures were appropriate. Respondents reported a high level of adherence to measures and low level of fear, both before and after the testing. Although these indicators were statistically significantly reduced after the test (P < 0.004), they did not result in irresponsible non-adherence behaviours. Almost all respondents attributed their application of personal protection measures to factors other than the results of serological screening. Conclusions: Serological tests do not contribute to irresponsible non-adherence behaviours in an environment where protective measures are efficient. However, they may help reduce fear within society and working environments."
1239,Combined oropharyngeal/nasal swab is equivalent to nasopharyngeal sampling for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic PCR.,"Background: Early 2020, a COVID-19 epidemic became a public health emergency of international concern. To address this pandemic broad testing with an easy, comfortable and reliable testing method is of utmost concern. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sampling is the reference method though hampered by international supply shortages. A new oropharyngeal/nasal (OP/N) sampling method was investigated using the more readily available throat swab. Results: 35 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by means of either NP or OP/N sampling. The paired swabs were both positive in 31 patients. The one patient who tested negative on both NP and OP/N swab on admission, was ultimately diagnosed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A strong correlation was found between the viral RNA loads of the paired swabs (r = 0.76; P < 0.05). The sensitivity of NP and OP/N analysis in hospitalized patients (n = 28) was 89.3% and 92.7% respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates equivalence of NP and OP/N sampling for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by means of rRT-PCR. Sensitivity of both NP and OP/N sampling is very high in hospitalized patients."
