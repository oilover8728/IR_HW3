8541,The role of dysregulated immune responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis.,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) which caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic threat to global public health. It has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations from mild to critical illness, the most serious of which is the complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 infection appears mild in infants and children, however, in adults, it can lead to serious consequences. In this review, we highlighted the differences between the immune responses of the lung in children and adults, immune dysregulation and their possible role in clinical manifestations in COVID-19. There is a reduction in population of immunocompetent cells during aging and subsequently induced ineffective inflammation in the faces of some infections. Dysregulation in the immune system can lead to an unappropriated local and systemic immune responses and subsequently the rapid spread of the virus, leading to severe COVID-19 disease. Therefore, recognizing the differences in the immune responses of various hosts as well as to improve the immune system disorder should always be part of research and treatment protocols."
8542,Guillain-Barre syndrome after COVID-19 vaccination.,"We report a case of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) occurring soon after the first dose of Vaxzevria (previously known as COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca). Thus far, there has been no evidence of an increased risk of GBS resulting from either COVID-19 infection nor from COVID-19 vaccines; however, individual cases and population cohorts should be scrutinised, in order to ensure the constant evaluation of such risks. It is as yet not possible to draw conclusions about any significant association between COVID-19 vaccination and GBS. A temporal correlation does not imply, and should not be deemed to signify, causality. However, it is important to remain vigilant, so that any potential increased risk is properly evaluated. The specific presentation of bifacial weakness as the initial symptom may be a characteristic feature of GBS in the context of recent COVID-19 vaccination."

8544,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Associated With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Children: A Case Series From Mayotte Island.,"During the COVID-19 outbreak in the French overseas department Mayotte, 11 children developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). They all had a fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Six patients were admitted to intensive care unit; management included intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroid. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was documented in all patients. The risk of developing MIS-C was much higher than in all of France."
8545,Novel application of automated machine learning with MALDI-TOF-MS for rapid high-throughput screening of COVID-19: a proof of concept.,"The 2019 novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created an unsustainable need for molecular diagnostic testing. Molecular approaches such as reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers highly sensitive and specific means to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, however, despite it being the accepted ""gold standard"", molecular platforms often require a tradeoff between speed versus throughput. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-time of flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry (MS) has been proposed as a potential solution for COVID-19 testing and finding a balance between analytical performance, speed, and throughput, without relying on impacted supply chains. Combined with machine learning (ML), this MALDI-TOF-MS approach could overcome logistical barriers encountered by current testing paradigms. We evaluated the analytical performance of an ML-enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS method for screening COVID-19. Residual nasal swab samples from adult volunteers were used for testing and compared against RT-PCR. Two optimized ML models were identified, exhibiting accuracy of 98.3%, positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100%, negative percent agreement (NPA) of 96%, and accuracy of 96.6%, PPA of 98.5%, and NPA of 94% respectively. Machine learning enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS for COVID-19 testing exhibited performance comparable to existing commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests."
8546,Dramatic Changes in Oncology Care Pathways During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The French ONCOCARE-COV Study.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have affected cancer management. We aimed to evaluate changes in every oncology care pathway essential step, from screening to treatment, during the pandemic. Monthly oncological activity differences between 2019 and 2020 (screening tests, histopathological analyzes, multidisciplinary tumor board meetings (MTBMs), diagnostic announcement procedures (DAPs), and treatments were calculated in two French areas experiencing different pandemic intensity (Reims and Colmar). COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact in terms of screening (-86% to -100%), diagnosis (-39%), and surgical treatment (-30%). This global decrease in all essential oncology care pathway steps contrasted with the relative stability of chemotherapy (-9%) and radiotherapy use (-16%). Outbreak occurred earlier and with more intensity in Colmar but had a comparable impact in both areas regarding MTMBs and DAPs. The current ONCOCARE-COV study is still in progress and with a longer follow-up to analyze postlockdown situation."
8547,COVID-2019 fundamentals.,"Background: A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified at the end of 2019. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19. The main purpose of this review was to provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The authors searched the MEDLINE database for clinical studies related to virus characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, transmission mechanisms, and treatment options. Results: As of January 27, 2021, the number of infected people and deaths associated with COVID-19 worldwide were approximately 100 million and 2 million, respectively. The manifestations of COVID-19 are variable, and the severity is affected by age and preexisting medical conditions. Children and adolescents are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Older adults, in comparison, may experience severe illness and have disproportionally elevated mortality. Among those who survive, some may experience enduring deficits. The viral load is particularly elevated in saliva and oropharynx, which constitute potential sources of infection. The diagnosis of the disease may be confounded by factors related to the replicating cycle of the virus, viral load, and sensitivity of the diagnostic method used. As of January 2021, COVID-19 has no cure but can be prevented. Its treatment is based on supportive care along with antiviral medications and monoclonal antibodies. In severe cases with multiorgan involvement, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and hemodynamic support may be necessary. Conclusions: COVID-19 is a transmittable disease with a variable course. A substantial number of patients, particularly children, remain asymptomatic. Important advances have been made in the development of new treatments. However, the mortality in vulnerable populations remains elevated. Practical implications: The elevated viral load in the oral cavity and pharynx suggests that oral health care professionals could get infected through occupational exposure. Providers should understand the variables that influence the yield of diagnostic studies because false-negative results can occur."
8548,[CONTACT LENS WEAR DURING THE COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) ERA].,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a single-strand RNA virus that first began spreading in December 2019 and evolved to a global pandemic within a few months. It's transmission is primarily through direct contact of the virus with mucous membranes which possess angiotensin-converting enzyme) ACE2(. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 are extremely rare and there is only evidence of low quantities of ACE2 in ocular tissue. Yet both the environment of the contact lens practice and the wearing of contact lenses present high potential risk of inadvertent infection. The data to date suggests no evidence of contracting COVID-19 through contact lenses and very little data supporting the possibility of coronavirus adherence to the ocular surface. To minimize opportunity for infection, practitioners may decide to delay non-essential visits. When they do examine, clinicians should wear personal protective gear as well as protective shields on equipment and include a thorough disinfecting of surfaces and equipment protocol between each examination. Patients should be reminded about the importance of appropriate contact lens hygene, namely hand washing with soap and water, drying with single use paper prior and after handling of lenses, proper disinfection and replacement of lenses and cases. Patients should not wear lenses when feeling ill and should be advised to consciously refrain from face touching to avoid unintentional contamination. This article reviews the information available to date related to contact lens wearers and their caregivers during this still-evolving crisis."
