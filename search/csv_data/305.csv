3043,The impact of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns accounting for antibody-dependent enhancement.,"Background: COVID-19 vaccines are approved, vaccination campaigns are launched, and worldwide return to normality seems within close reach. Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods and findings: We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and-importantly-some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. The model is intended to facilitate decision making by exploring ranges of parameters rather than to be fitted by empirical data. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75%-80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. Conclusions: With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year's flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management."
3044,Covid-19 vaccine management (Comirnaty and mrna-1273 Moderna) in a teaching hospital in Italy: a short report on the vaccination campaign.,"Objectives: In this article, we aim to share our experience in the hospital reorganization made to conduct the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign, based on the principles of flexibility and adaptability. Study design: A descriptive study. Methods: The data concerning the organization of the vaccination campaign were taken from the operative protocol developed by the hospital dedicated task force, composed by experts in hygiene, public health, occupational medicine, pharmacists, nurses, hospital quality, and disaster managers. Data about the numbers of vaccine administered daily were collected by the Innovation and Development Operative Unit database. Results: Vaccinations against COVID-19 started across the EU on the 27th of December 2020. The first phase of the vaccination campaign carried out in our hospital was directed to healthcare workers immunization including medical residents, social care operators, administrative staff and technicians, students of medicine, and health professions trainees. The second phase was enlarged to the coverage of extremely fragile subjects. Thanks to the massive employment of healthcare workers and the establishment of dynamic pathways, it was possible to achieve short turnaround times and a large number of doses administered daily, with peaks of 870 vaccines per day. From the 27th of December up to the 14th of March a total of 26,341 doses of Pfizer have been administered. 13,584 were first doses and 12,757 were second doses. From the 4th to the 14th of March, 296 first doses of Moderna were dispensed. It was necessary to implement adequate spaces and areas adopting anti-contagion safety measures: waiting area for subjects to be vaccinated, working rooms for the dilution of the vaccine and the storage of the material, vaccination rooms, post-vaccination observation areas, room for observation, and treatment of any adverse reactions, with an emergency cart available in each working area. Conclusions: The teaching hospital of Pisa faced the beginning of the immunization campaign readjusting its spaces, planning an adequate hospital vaccination area and providing an organization plan to ensure the achievement of the targets of the campaign. This represented a challenge due to limited vaccine doses supplied and the multisectoral teams of professionals to coordinate in the shortest time and the safest way possible. The organizational model adopted proved to be adequate and therefore exploited also for the second phase aimed to extremely fragile subjects."

3046,The kinetics of viral load and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.,"Objectives: The aim was to understand persistence of the virus in body fluids the and immune response of an infected host to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: We determined the kinetics of viral load in several body fluids through real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, serum antibodies of IgA, IgG and IgM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralizing antibodies by microneutralization assay in 35 COVID-19 cases from two hospitals in Guangdong, China. Results: We found higher viral loads and prolonged shedding of virus RNA in severe cases of COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal (1.3 × 106 vs 6.4 × 104, p < 0.05; 7∼8 weeks) and throat (6.9 × 106 vs 2.9 × 105, p < 0.05; 4∼5 weeks), but similar in sputum samples (5.5 × 106 vs 0.9 × 106, p < 0.05; 4∼5 weeks). Viraemia was rarely detected (2.8%, n = 1/35). We detected early seroconversion of IgA and IgG at the first week after illness onset (day 5, 5.7%, n = 2/35). Neutralizing antibodies were produced in the second week, and observed in all 35 included cases after the third week illness onset. The levels of neutralizing antibodies correlated with IgG (rs = 0.85, p < 0.05; kappa = 0.85) and IgA (rs = 0.64, p < 0.05; kappa = 0.61) in severe, but not mild cases (IgG, rs = 0.42, kappa = 0.33; IgA, rs = 0.32, kappa = 0.22). No correlation with IgM in either severe (rs = 0.17, kappa = 0.06) or mild cases (rs = 0.27, kappa = 0.15) was found. Discussion: We revealed a prolonged shedding of virus RNA in the upper respiratory tract, and evaluated the consistency of production of IgG, IgA, IgM and neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 cases."
3047,COVID-19: opportunities for public health ethics?,"Public health ethics is the discipline that ensures that public health professionals and policy makers explain what they do, and why. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ethical deliberations often did not feature explicitly in public health decisions, thus reducing transparency and consistency in decision-making processes, and resulting in loss of trust by the general public. A public health ethics framework based on principles would add to transparency and consistency in public health decision-making. A framework of seven principles is presented and illustrated by applying them to vital COVID-19 ethical questions. Next the question of COVID-19 vaccination shows how the principles work in conjunction. In conclusion, embedding explicit ethical analysis in public health work is necessary to be trustworthy and regain trust. Preparedness for future challenges implies making the public health community more 'ethically literate'."
3048,Predicting patients with false negative SARS-CoV-2 testing at hospital admission: A retrospective multi-center study.,"Importance: False negative SARS-CoV-2 tests can lead to spread of infection in the inpatient setting to other patients and healthcare workers. However, the population of patients with COVID who are admitted with false negative testing is unstudied. Objective: To characterize and develop a model to predict true SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients who initially test negative for COVID by PCR. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Five hospitals within the Yale New Haven Health System between 3/10/2020 and 9/1/2020. Participants: Adult patients who received diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. Exposure: We developed a logistic regression model from readily available electronic health record data to predict SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients who were positive for COVID and those who were negative and never retested. Main outcomes and measures: This model was applied to patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 who were retested within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. We evaluated the ability of the model to discriminate between patients who would subsequently retest negative and those who would subsequently retest positive. Results: We included 31,459 hospitalized adult patients; 2,666 of these patients tested positive for COVID and 3,511 initially tested negative for COVID and were retested. Of the patients who were retested, 61 (1.7%) had a subsequent positive COVID test. The model showed that higher age, vital sign abnormalities, and lower white blood cell count served as strong predictors for COVID positivity in these patients. The model had moderate performance to predict which patients would retest positive with a test set area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70-0.83). Using a cutpoint for our risk prediction model at the 90th percentile for probability, we were able to capture 35/61 (57%) of the patients who would retest positive. This cutpoint amounts to a number-needed-to-retest range between 15 and 77 patients. Conclusion and relevance: We show that a pragmatic model can predict which patients should be retested for COVID. Further research is required to determine if this risk model can be applied prospectively in hospitalized patients to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections."
3049,[Mass testing for Covid-19 : what can we learn from real-world implementation ?].,"While several modelling studies suggest mass testing for SARS-CoV-2 could be effective, real-world attempts at implementation have not been sufficient to evaluate its contribution to controlling the pandemic. To slow the spread of the virus, a mass-testing campaign would need frequent testing over a prolonged period with high rates of participation, all while maintaining public health measures. Screening seems more useful for targeted populations or high-risk events (businesses, teaching facilities, public or private institutions, sporting or cultural events). With their low cost and rapid results, rapid tests should be favored for these interventions."
