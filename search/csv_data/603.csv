6020,Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 humanized antibody with paper-based ELISA.,"This work reports the development of a rapid, simple and inexpensive colorimetric paper-based assay for the detection of the severe acute respiratory symptom coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) humanized antibody. The paper device was prepared with lamination for easy sample handling and coated with the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen. This assay employed a colorimetric reaction, which is followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated detecting antibody in the presence of the 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. The colorimetric readout was evaluated and quantified for specificity and sensitivity. The characterization of this assay includes determining the linear regression curve, the limit of detection (LOD), the repeatability, and testing complex biological samples. We found that the LOD of the assay was 9.00 ng μL-1 (0.112 IU mL-1). The relative standard deviation was approximately 10% for a sample number of n = 3. We believe that our proof-of-concept assay has the potential to be developed for clinical screening of the SARS-CoV-2 humanized antibody as a tool to confirm infected active cases or to confirm SARS-CoV-2 immune cases during the process of vaccine development."
6021,COVID-19 Vaccines Safety Tracking (CoVaST): Protocol of a Multi-Center Prospective Cohort Study for Active Surveillance of COVID-19 Vaccines' Side Effects.,"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine-related side effects have a determinant role in the public decision regarding vaccination. Therefore, this study has been designed to actively monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines globally. Methods: A multi-country, three-phase study including a cross-sectional survey to test for the short-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccines among target population groups. In the second phase, we will monitor the booster doses' side effects, while in the third phase, the long-term safety and effectiveness will be investigated. A validated, self-administered questionnaire will be used to collect data from the target population; Results: The study protocol has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, with the identifier NCT04834869. Conclusions: CoVaST is the first independent study aiming to monitor the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines following booster doses, and the long-term safety and effectiveness of said vaccines."

6023,Early Virus Clearance and Delayed Antibody Response in a Case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) With a History of Coinfection With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 and Hepatitis C Virus.,"The effect of host immune status on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains unknown. Here, we report the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/hepatitis C virus coinfection, who showed a persistently negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test but delayed antibody response in the plasma. This case highlights the influence of HIV-1-induced immune dysfunction on early SARS-CoV-2 clearance."
6024,Prevalence and characteristics of myocardial injury during COVID-19 pandemic: A new role for high-sensitive troponin.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease that is causing a public health emergency. Characteristics and clinical significance of myocardial injury remain unclear. Methods: This retrospective single-center study analyzed 189 patients who received a COVID-19 diagnosis out of all 758 subjects with a high sensitive troponin I (Hs-TnI) measurement within the first 24 h of admission at the Policlinico A.Gemelli (Rome, Italy) between February 20th 2020 to April 09th 2020. Results: The prevalence of myocardial injury in our COVID-19 population is of 16%. The patients with cardiac injury were older, had a greater number of cardiovascular comorbidities and higher values of acute phase and inflammatory markers and leucocytes. They required more frequently hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit (10 [32.3%] vs 18 [11.4%]; p = .003) and the mortality rate was significantly higher (17 [54.8%] vs. 15 [9.5%], p < .001). Among patients in ICU, the subjects with myocardial injury showed an increase need of endotracheal intubation (8 out of 9 [88%] vs 7 out of 19[37%], p = .042). Multivariate analyses showed that hs-TnI can significantly predict the degree of COVID-19 disease, the intubation need and in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: In this study we demonstrate that hs-Tn can significantly predict disease severity, intubation need and in-hospital death. Therefore, it may be reasonable to use Hs-Tn as a clinical tool in COVID-19 patients in order to triage them into different risk groups and can play a pivotal role in the detection of subjects at high risk of cardiac impairment during both the early and recovery stage."
6025,Infliximab is associated with attenuated immunogenicity to BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with IBD.,"Objective: Delayed second dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination trades maximal effectiveness for a lower level of immunity across more of the population. We investigated whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with infliximab have attenuated serological responses to a single dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Design: Antibody responses and seroconversion rates in infliximab-treated patients (n=865) were compared with a cohort treated with vedolizumab (n=428), a gut-selective anti-integrin α4β7 monoclonal antibody. Our primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody concentrations, measured using the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody assay 3-10 weeks after vaccination, in patients without evidence of prior infection. Secondary outcomes were seroconversion rates (defined by a cut-off of 15 U/mL), and antibody responses following past infection or a second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Results: Geometric mean (SD) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations were lower in patients treated with infliximab than vedolizumab, following BNT162b2 (6.0 U/mL (5.9) vs 28.8 U/mL (5.4) p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (4.7 U/mL (4.9)) vs 13.8 U/mL (5.9) p<0.0001) vaccines. In our multivariable models, antibody concentrations were lower in infliximab-treated compared with vedolizumab-treated patients who received the BNT162b2 (fold change (FC) 0.29 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.40), p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (FC 0.39 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.51), p<0.0001) vaccines. In both models, age ≥60 years, immunomodulator use, Crohn's disease and smoking were associated with lower, while non-white ethnicity was associated with higher, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations. Seroconversion rates after a single dose of either vaccine were higher in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. Conclusion: Infliximab is associated with attenuated immunogenicity to a single dose of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccination after SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a second dose of vaccine, led to seroconversion in most patients. Delayed second dosing should be avoided in patients treated with infliximab.

6029,[Analysis of the positive rate of anal swab nucleic acid test and clinical characteristics in patients with different severity of coronavirus disease 2019].,"Objective: To compared the positive rate of anal swab nucleic acid test and clinical characteristics of critical and general coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: Clinical data of 18 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the First People's Hospital of Lianyungang City from February to March 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into general group (n = 11) and critical ill group (n = 7) according to the severity of the disease. The differences of gender, age, epidemiological characteristics, fever duration after admission, underlaying disease, positive rate of anal swab nucleic acid test at admission and two times of negative pharyngeal swab test were compared between the two groups. Results: There were no significant differences in gender, age, fever duration after admission or underlaying disease between the two groups. The number of anorectal swab positive cases in critically ill group was significantly higher than that in general group (cases: 4 vs. 1, P = 0.047). After two negative pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test, the number of anal swab positive cases in critical illness group was still higher than that in general group (cases: 2 vs. 0), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.137). The number of non-local infection in critical ill group was significantly higher than that in general group (cases: 4 vs. 0, P = 0.047). All of the 4 non-local infected patients had a history of living in Wuhan. Conclusions: The patients with anorectal swab nucleic acid positive may have a more serious condition. It may be a risk to transfer ill patients out of the isolation ward by the criteria of only two times of negative pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test. Patients returning to our city after infection in Wuhan may be more serious."
