6640,Optical coherence tomography angiography analysis of the retina in patients recovered from COVID-19: a case-control study.,"Objective: To quantify the density of the macular microvasculature and the area of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in patients recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis. Methods: In a comparative cross-sectional, observational study, patients recovered from COVID-19 were included in this study. All included subjects exhibited a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Spectral domain macular OCTA was performed at least 2 weeks after recovery from systemic COVID-19. Vessel density (VD) of the superficial (SCP) and deep retinal capillary plexus (DCP) and the area of the FAZ were measured in COVID-19 recovered patients versus age-matched normal controls. Results: Thirty-one recovered COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy normal controls were studied. Mean quality scan index was 7.64 ± 0.66 in the COVID cases and 8.34 ± 0.71 in the normal controls (p = 0.001). Mean SCP VD and DCP VD of the COVID cohort were significantly lower than the SCP VD and DCP VD of the control group in the foveal and parafoveal regions. FAZ area was greater in the COVID cohort, but this difference was not statistically significant. In addition, in the COVID cohort, VD of the SCP was lower in patients with a history of COVID-19 hospitalization versus those without such a history, but this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Patients recovered from COVID-19 displayed alterations in the retinal microvasculature, including a significantly lower VD in the SCP and DCP. Patients with coronavirus infection may be at risk of retinal vascular complications."

6643,Viral Proteases as Targets for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Drug Development.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to be a global threat since its emergence. Although several COVID-19 vaccines have become available, the prospective timeframe for achieving effective levels of vaccination across global populations remains uncertain. Moreover, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants presents continuing potential challenges for future vaccination planning. Therefore, development of effective antiviral therapies continues to be an urgent unmet need for COVID-19. Successful antiviral regimens for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections have established viral proteases as validated targets for antiviral drug development. In this context, we review protease targets in drug development, currently available antiviral protease inhibitors, and therapeutic development efforts on SARS-CoV-2 main protease and papain-like protease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a global threat since its emergence. The development of effective antiviral therapeutics for COVID-19 remains an urgent and long-term need. Because viral proteases are validated drug targets, specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 protease inhibitors are critical therapeutics to be developed for treatment of COVID-19."
6644,"COVID-19 Outbreak Among a University's Men's and Women's Soccer Teams - Chicago, Illinois, July-August 2020.","Data on transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), among college athletes are limited. In August 2020, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) was notified of a cluster of COVID-19 cases among a university's men's and women's soccer teams. CDPH initiated an investigation, interviewed members of both teams, and collated laboratory data to understand transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the teams. Numerous social gatherings with limited mask use or social distancing preceded the outbreak. Transmission resulted in 17 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases across both teams (n = 45), likely from a single source introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (based on whole genome sequencing) and subsequent transmission during multiple gatherings. Colleges and universities are at risk for COVID-19 outbreaks because of shared housing and social gatherings where recommended prevention guidance is not followed. Improved strategies to promote mask use and social distancing among college-aged adults need to be implemented, as well as periodic repeat testing to identify asymptomatic infections and prevent outbreaks among groups at increased risk for infection because of frequent exposure to close contacts in congregate settings on and off campus."
6645,Preliminary Results of Initial Testing for Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Emergency Department.,"Introduction: On March 10, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic due to widespread infection of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). We report the preliminary results of a targeted program of COVID-19 infection testing in the ED in the first 10 days of its initiation at our institution. Methods: We conducted a review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs during the initial 10 days of testing (March 10-19, 2020). During this initial period with limited resources, testing was targeted toward high-risk patients per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Data collected from patients who were tested included demographics, clinical characteristics, and test qualifying criteria. We present the data overall and by test results with descriptive statistics. Results: During the 10-day study period, the combined census of the study EDs was 2157 patient encounters. A total of 283 tests were ordered in the ED. The majority of patients were 18-64 years of age, male, non-Hispanic white, had an Emergency Severity Index score of three, did not have a fever, and were discharged from the ED. A total of 29 (10.2%) tested positive. Symptoms-based criteria most associated with COVID-19 were the most common criteria identified for testing (90.6%). All other criteria were reported in 5.51-43.0% of persons being tested. Having contact with a person under investigation was significantly more common in those who tested positive compared to those who tested negative (63% vs 24.5%, respectively). The majority of patients in both results groups had at least two qualifying criteria for testing (75.2%). Conclusion: In this review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs in the first 10 days of testing, we found that 10.2% of those tested were identified as positive. The continued monitoring of testing and results will help providers understand how COVID-19 is progressing in the community."
6646,Humoral Response after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination in a Cohort of Hemodialysis Patients and Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"Background: Kidney transplant recipients and patients receiving hemodialysis are immunocompromised populations that are prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination but were excluded from clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. Antibody titers and rates of seroconversion after vaccination are lower among patients with CKD and those taking immunosuppressants compared with controls. Data are lacking regarding their humoral response to vaccination to prevent COVID-19. Methods: This investigation of early serological response after COVID-19 vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine included 78 patients undergoing hemodialysis, 74 kidney transplant recipients, and seven healthy controls. We recorded data from the medical file for various clinical parameters, including response to hepatitis B vaccination, and measured antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 at 0, 14, 28, 36, and 58 days after the first injection. Results: In controls, we detected antibodies at a positive level (>13 arbitrary units per ml; AU/ml) at day 14 postinjection, which increased progressively to peak at day 36 (1082 AU/ml; interquartile range [IQR], 735.0-1662.0). Patients undergoing hemodialysis had lower titers that peaked at day 58 (276 AU/ml; IQR, 83.4-526.0). We detected a positive antibody level in only three transplant recipients at day 36. In patients on hemodialysis, those aged <75 years had a higher antibody response versus those aged >75 years, and serum albumin and Kt/V were positively correlated with serological response (P<0.04 and P<0.0, respectively); nonresponders to HBV vaccine had the lowest anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the postvaccination humoral response is strongly inhibited by immunosuppressant therapy in kidney transplant recipients, and is reduced by the uremic condition in patients undergoing hemodialysis."

6648,Assessment of global asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and management practices from China.,"With ongoing research, it was found that asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was widespread in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) populations. Studies have confirmed asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 have potential infectivity, and most of the transmission occurred before symptoms appear. Asymptomatic infection rates varied widely in different countries and regions. Identifying the asymptomatic infected persons and cutting off the infection source is an effective way to prevent the spread of this disease. However, asymptomatic patients have hidden clinical symptoms, and screening based only on the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 can easily lead to a missed diagnosis. Therefore, determining asymptomatic infection patients by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is the gold standard. A series of prevention and control measures adopted by the Chinese government, especially the ""Four Early"" policy, have achieved outstanding achievements, which are worth learning from by other countries."
