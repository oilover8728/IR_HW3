610,"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibodies, Japan, June 2020.","We used 2 commercially available antibody tests to estimate seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Japan during June 2020. Of 7,950 samples, 8 were positive by both assays. Using 2 reliable antibody tests in conjunction is an effective method for estimating seroprevalence in low prevalence settings."
611,Two SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays comparison and time-course profile of antibodies response.,"Introduction: The persistence of circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet well known. We compare the results of 2 automated systems for the determination of IgG against SARS CoV-2 and assess the time-course of the IgG response. Methods: IgG were measured in 103 specimens of 55 patients with COVID-19 (time from the symptoms' onset: 3-187 days) using the automated tests ""Abbott SARS-COV-2 IgG"" and ""MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG"". Results: The 2 methods had a concordance of 90.3%, but the quantitative correlation, although significant, showed dispersed results. All the specimens resulted positive after 17 days. However, the median concentrations of IgG rapidly increased up to 20 days and decreased for Maglumi IgG while Abbott IgG showed a constant trend up to 85 days, and then slowly declined. Conclusions: The titer of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 may significantly and rapidly decrease, but with a very different time-course depending on the method used for the determination."
612,SARS-CoV-2: Comparative analysis of different RNA extraction methods.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although other diagnostic methods have been introduced, detection of viral genes on oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse-transcription real time-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays is still the gold standard. Efficient viral RNA extraction is a prerequisite for downstream performance of rRT-PCR assays. Currently, several automatic methods that include RNA extraction are available. However, due to the growing demand, a shortage in kit supplies could be experienced in several labs. For these reasons, the use of different commercial or in-house protocols for RNA extraction may increase the possibility to analyze high number of samples. Herein, we compared the efficiency of RNA extraction of three different commercial kits and an in-house extraction protocol using synthetic ssRNA standards of SARS-CoV-2 as well as in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs from six COVID-19-positive patients. It was concluded that tested commercial kits can be used with some modifications for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome by rRT-PCR approaches, although with some differences in RNA yields. Conversely, EXTRAzol reagent was the less efficient due to the phase separation principle at the basis of RNA extraction. Overall, this study offers alternative suitable methods to manually extract RNA that can be taken into account for SARS-CoV-2 detection."
613,SARS-CoV-2 Detection on Bronchoalveolar Lavage: An Italian Multicenter experience.,"Background: Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) pandemic should be reserved to a limited number of clinical indications. The yield of BAL for the diagnosis of suspected or confirmed pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unknown. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic ratio of BAL in detecting SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary infection in patients undergoing bronchoscopy for different indications as well as describe the clinical, radiological, and endoscopic characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 on BAL. Method: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study including all patients who underwent bronchoscopy for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on BAL. Clinical, computed tomography (CT), endoscopic, and microbiologic data were gathered from March 16th to May 27th, 2020. Results: 131 patients were included. Bronchoscopy was performed for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (65.5%), alternative diagnosis (12.9%), suspected superinfections (19.8%), and lung atelectasis (1.5%). SARS-CoV-2 was isolated on BAL 43 times (32.8%) and the highest isolation rate was in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (74.4%); 76% of positive patients had a double-negative nasopharyngeal swab. Peripheral, posterior and multilobar CT opacities were more frequent in SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the number of CT findings was higher in positive patients, particularly those with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We recorded a progressive reduction of SARS-CoV-2 isolation during the observation period. Conclusions: In our centers, the rate of detection of SARS-CoV-2 on BAL in patients with suspected infection was 37.2%. The agreement of BAL with nasopharyngeal swabs was high; CT alterations could predict the pretest probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but suspicion of viral infection should be always considered."
614,Editorial: SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccines and the Possible Mechanism of Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT).,"During 2020 and 2021, the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respi- ratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in high death rates and acute and chronic morbidity in all countries. The rapid development of new mRNA vaccines to SARS-CoV-2 brings hope that the spread of this virus can be controlled. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine developed by a collaboration between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca showed efficacy in clinical trials, with a good safety profile. However, there have been recent reports of the rare development of thrombotic events in young women following vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, particularly of the rare condition of cavernous sinus thrombosis. Studies have begun to in- vestigate whether antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike cross-react with platelet factor 4 (PF4/CXLC4) and mim- ic autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This Medical Science Monitor Editorial aims to briefly update the current status of studies on a possible rare complication of using new mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19."

616,The variability of the serological response to SARS-corona virus-2: Potential resolution of ambiguity through determination of avidity (functional affinity).,"Data on the serological response toward severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 16 recent reports were analyzed and a high degree of variability was shown. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) responses were either found earlier than IgG, or together with IgG, later than IgG, or were missing. Therefore, clear distinctions between early, intermediate, and past infections are obviously not possible merely on the basis of IgM and IgG determinations. A review of publications on the serology of other virus groups shows that variable IgM responses can be found as well and therefore are not unique for SARS-CoV-2 infections. A model to explain this variability is proposed. The inclusion of avidity determination into regular diagnostic procedures has allowed to resolve such ""atypical"" serological constellations. The potential use of avidity determination for the diagnosis of COVID-19, for risk assessment, epidemiological studies, analysis of cross reactions, as well as for the control of vaccination programs is suggested and discussed."
617,External Quality Assessment for Molecular Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Clinical Laboratories.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a huge threat to public health. Viral nucleic acid testing is the diagnostic gold standard and can play an important role in the prevention and control of this infection. In this study, bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles encapsulating specific RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses were prepared by genetic engineering. The assessment panel, consisting of four positive samples with concentrations of 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, and 4.9 log10 copies/mL and five negative samples with other human coronaviruses, was prepared and distributed to evaluate the accuracy of routine viral RNA detection. Results of 931 panels from 844 laboratories were collected. The overall percentage agreement, positive percentage agreement (PPA), and negative percentage agreement, defined as the percentage of agreement between the correct results and total results submitted for all, positive, and negative samples were 96.8% (8109/8379), 93.9% (3497/3724), and 99.1% (4612/4655), respectively. For samples with concentrations of 4.9 and 4.2 log10 copies/mL, the PPAs were >95%. However, for 3.5 and 2.8 log10 copies/mL, the PPAs were 94.6% (881/931) and 84.9% (790/931), respectively. For all negative samples, the negative percentage agreement values were >95%. Thus, most laboratories can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2. However, further improvement and optimization are required to ensure the accuracy of detection in panel members with lower concentrations of viral RNA."
618,The significance of bioengineered nanoplatforms against SARS-CoV-2: From detection to genome editing.,"COVID-19 outbreak can impose serious negative impacts on the infrastructures of societies including the healthcare systems. Despite the increasing research efforts, false positive or negative results that may be associated with serologic or even RT-PCR tests, inappropriate or variable immune response, and high rates of mutations in coronavirus may negatively affect virus detection process and effectiveness of the vaccines or drugs in development. Nanotechnology-based research attempts via developing state-of-the-art techniques such as nanomechatronics ones and advanced materials including the sensors for detecting the pathogen loads at very low concentrations or site-specific delivery of therapeutics, and real-time protections against the pandemic outbreaks by nanorobots can provide outstanding biomedical breakthroughs. Considering the unique characteristics of pathogens particularly the newly-emerged ones and avoiding the exaggerated optimism or simplistic views on the prophylactic and therapeutic approaches including the one-size-fits-all ones or presenting multiple medications that may be associated with synergistic toxicities rather than enhanced efficiencies might pave the way towards the development of more appropriate treatment strategies with reduced safety concerns. This paper highlights the significance of nanoplatforms against the viral disorders and their capabilities of genome editing that may facilitate taking more appropriate measures against SARS-CoV-2."
619,SARS Coronavirus-2 variant tracing within the first Coronavirus Disease 19 clusters in northern Germany.,"Objectives: Investigation whether in depth characterization of virus variant patterns can be used for epidemiological analysis of the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection clusters in Hamburg, Germany. Methods: Metagenomic RNA-sequencing and amplicon-sequencing and subsequent variant calling in 25 respiratory samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients involved in the earliest infection clusters in Hamburg. Results: Amplikon sequencing and cluster analyses of these SARS-CoV-2 sequences allowed the identification of the first infection cluster and five non-related infection clusters occurring at the beginning of the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the Hamburg metropolitan region. Viral genomics together with epidemiological analyses revealed that the index patient acquired the infection in northern Italy and transmitted it to two out of 134 contacts. Single nucleotide polymorphisms clearly distinguished the virus variants of the index and other clusters and allowed us to track in which sequences worldwide these mutations were first described. Minor variant analyses identified the transmission of intra-host variants in the index cluster and household clusters. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 variant tracing allows the identification of infection clusters and the follow up of infection chains occurring in the population. Furthermore, the follow up of minor viral variants in infection clusters can provide further resolution on transmission events indistinguishable at a consensus sequence level."
