7701,COVID-19 and cancer: A guide with suggested COVID-19 rule-out criteria to support clinical decision-making.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious zoonotic pathogen that has exacted heavy public health, social and economic tolls. In February 2020, the World Health Organization acronymed the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19, for coronavirus disease 2019. The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, which has been detected in at least 103 countries, has reached 1,970,225 worldwide as of April 14, 2020 with 124,544 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many cases of COVID-19 resolve quickly. However, the disease, which, like other respiratory pathogens that cause common cold symptoms is believed to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. Infection with COVID-19 can also lead to significant morbidity and death; this is particularly the case for cancer patients. Moreover, because the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are easily misattributed to the sequelae of cancer itself, such as pulmonary embolism, or its treatment, such as nausea and diarrhea, diagnosis may be delayed or missed. Potential COVID-19 rule out criteria, based on the Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism, another protean disease entity, are provided as a decision-making aid. This review summarizes the current understanding of the transmission, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathogenesis, rationale to treat the cancer or not, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 with an emphasis on implications in cancer."
7702,Protocol for a national probability survey using home specimen collection methods to assess prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody response.,"Purpose: The U.S. response to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has been hampered by early and ongoing delays in testing for infection; without data on where infections were occurring and the magnitude of the epidemic, early public health responses were not data-driven. Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and immune response is critical to developing and implementing effective public health responses. Most serological surveys have been limited to localities that opted to conduct them and/or were based on convenience samples. Moreover, results of antibody testing might be subject to high false positive rates in the setting of low prevalence of immune response and imperfect test specificity. Methods: We will conduct a national serosurvey for SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity and immune experience. A probability sample of U.S. addresses will be mailed invitations and kits for the self-collection of anterior nares swab and finger prick dried blood spot specimens. Within each sampled household, one adult 18 years or older will be randomly selected and asked to complete a questionnaire and to collect and return biological specimens to a central laboratory. Nasal swab specimens will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RNA PCR; dried blood spot specimens will be tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., immune experience) by enzyme-linked immunoassays. Positive screening tests for antibodies will be confirmed by a second antibody test with different antigenic basis to improve predictive value of positive (PPV) antibody test results. All persons returning specimens in the baseline phase will be enrolled into a follow-up cohort and mailed additional specimen collection kits 3 months after baseline. A subset of 10% of selected households will be invited to participate in full household testing, with tests offered for all household members aged ≥3 years. The main study outcomes will be period prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and immune experience, and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody responses. Results: Power calculations indicate that a national sample of 4000 households will facilitate estimation of national SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody prevalence with acceptably narrow 95% confidence intervals across several possible scenarios of prevalence levels. Oversampling in up to seven populous states will allow for prevalence estimation among subpopulations. Our 2-stage algorithm for antibody testing produces acceptable PPV at prevalence levels ≥1.0%. Including oversamples in states, we expect to receive data from as many as 9156 participants in 7495 U.S. households. Conclusions: In addition to providing robust estimates of prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune experience, we anticipate this study will establish a replicable methodology for home-based SARS-CoV-2 testing surveys, address concerns about selection bias, and improve positive predictive value of serology results. Prevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune experience produced by this study will greatly improve our understanding of the spectrum of COVID-19 disease, its current penetration in various demographic, geographic, and occupational groups, and inform the range of symptoms associated with infection. These data will inform resource needs for control of the ongoing epidemic and facilitate data-driven decisions for epidemic mitigation strategies."
7703,Safety of components and platforms of COVID-19 vaccines considered for use in pregnancy: A rapid review.,"Background: Rapid assessment of COVID-19 vaccine safety during pregnancy is urgently needed. Methods: We conducted a rapid systematic review, to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines selected by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access-Maternal Immunization Working Group in August 2020, including their components and their technological platforms used in other vaccines for pregnant persons. We searched literature databases, COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy registries, and explored reference lists from the inception date to February 2021 without language restriction. Pairs of reviewers independently selected studies through COVIDENCE, and performed the data extraction and the risk of bias assessment. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021234185). Results: We retrieved 6757 records and 12 COVID-19 pregnancy registries from the search strategy; 38 clinical and non-clinical studies (involving 2,398,855 pregnant persons and 56 pregnant animals) were included. Most studies (89%) were conducted in high-income countries and were cohort studies (57%). Most studies (76%) compared vaccine exposures with no exposure during the three trimesters of pregnancy. The most frequent exposure was to AS03 adjuvant, in the context of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines, (n = 24) and aluminum-based adjuvants (n = 11). Only one study reported exposure to messenger RNA in lipid nanoparticles COVID-19 vaccines. Except for one preliminary report about A/H1N1 influenza vaccination (adjuvant AS03), corrected by the authors in a more thorough analysis, all studies concluded that there were no safety concerns. Conclusion: This rapid review found no evidence of pregnancy-associated safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines or of their components or platforms when used in other vaccines. However, the need for further data on several vaccine platforms and components is warranted, given their novelty. Our findings support current WHO guidelines recommending that pregnant persons may consider receiving COVID-19 vaccines, particularly if they are at high risk of exposure or have comorbidities that enhance the risk of severe disease."

7705,Antiviral Activity of Influenza A Virus Defective Interfering Particles against SARS-CoV-2 Replication In Vitro through Stimulation of Innate Immunity.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late 2019 and resulted in a devastating pandemic. Although the first approved vaccines were already administered by the end of 2020, worldwide vaccine availability is still limited. Moreover, immune escape variants of the virus are emerging against which the current vaccines may confer only limited protection. Further, existing antivirals and treatment options against COVID-19 show only limited efficacy. Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) were previously proposed not only for antiviral treatment of the influenza disease but also for pan-specific treatment of interferon (IFN)-sensitive respiratory virus infections. To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. We show that treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. Further, our results suggest boosting of IFN-induced antiviral activity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as an effective antiviral agent for treatment of COVID-19, and potentially also for suppressing the replication of new variants of SARS-CoV-2."
7706,Stable and safe organ procurement and transplantation during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany.,"Solid organ transplantation is a lifesaving routine procedure. In the wake of the COVID‐19 pandemic, procurement and transplantation programs in many countries experienced a considerable reduction of organ donation and transplantation by up to 90% caused by an capacity overload of health care providers but also for fear of increased COVID‐19 related risks for transplant recipients acquired by viral transmissions from donor to recipient or early after transplantation. Competition for intensive care capacity for severely ill COVID‐19 patients versus transplant recipients and organ donors could also have played a role. In Germany, early pandemic management with high capacity testing including all potential organ donors, marked extension of intensive care capacities, structural health care system with a relatively high number of hospitals with intensive care units (1248) as well as transplant centers (40) with high capacities and regional organization of organ donation and transplantation may have been advantageous."
7707,Promoting access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma in low- and middle-income countries.,"Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain neglected in the Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) (i.e. plasma collected from individuals after their recovery from COVID-19) has emerged as a leading medical treatment for COVID-19. Studies to date support the safety-and increasingly the efficacy-of CCP to treat COVID-19. This has motivated large-scale procurement and transfusion of CCP, notably in the United States (US), where inventories of CCP have been attained, and government-supported stockpiling of CCP is underway. CCP is a therapy that could be implemented in LMICs. However, systemic and transfusion-specific challenges (e.g. capacity for donor mobilization and collections) impede local procurement of this resource in sufficient volumes to meet clinical demand. This raises the question as to whether there are strategies to facilitate sharing of CCP with LMICs and/or bolstering local capacity for collection to contend with the health crisis. While compelling, there are cost-related, logistical and regulatory barriers to both approaches. For one, there is complexity in diverting national interest (e.g. in the US) away from an epidemic that displays few signs of abating. There are also concerns regarding equitable distribution of CCP in LMICs and how that might be overcome. Further, the barriers to blood donation in general apply to collection of CCP; these obstacles are longstanding, accounting for the inability of many LMICs to meet their blood transfusion needs. Nonetheless, CCP affords dual opportunity for humanitarian outreach while tackling a broader challenge of blood transfusion safety and availability."
7708,Older Adults' Behavior Intentions Once a COVID-19 Vaccine Becomes Available.,"Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of antecedent variables on older adults' intention to get a CORONAVIRUS DISEASE-2019 vaccine. Older adults are at higher risk of severe illness from the disease and face an increasingly ageist general population who misrepresent the pandemic as an older adult problem. We use the Theory of Planned Behavior framework to examine vaccine behavior intention. Method: A convenience sample (n = 583) of adults aged 60 and older in the United States participated in an online survey using vignettes. Hierarchical regression and analysis of covariance were used to test our model. Results: Results suggest that perceived risk of the pandemic, general vaccine beliefs, and political affiliation influence respondents' attitude toward the vaccine. Respondents' attitudes toward the vaccine and their physician's recommendation help shape vaccine intention. Conclusion: The results provide partial support to the proposed model in shaping vaccine intention among older adults."
7709,"Possible Human-to-Dog Transmission of SARS-CoV-2, Italy, 2020.","We detected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in an otherwise healthy poodle living with 4 family members who had coronavirus disease. We observed antibodies in serum samples taken from the dog, indicating seroconversion. Full-length genome sequencing showed that the canine and human viruses were identical, suggesting human-to-animal transmission."
