6250,Outbreak of COVID-19: An emerging global pandemic threat.,"Since the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, it is now recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) as more than 200 countries and territories worldwide are affected with an increasing incidence. The SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a spectrum of non-specific signs and symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic infection, to flu-like illness such as fever, cough, dry cough and fatigue, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even multi-organ failures with high morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets that infected people exhale during incubation and onset period. By 12 June 2020, over 7.5 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with more than 421,000 deaths in the world have been reported to the WHO. No specific medication is approved to treat COVID-19, raising the urgent need for antiviral drug development. By 12 June 2020, there are over 1000 clinical trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov for treatment of COVID-19. This review summarizes the epidemiology, virology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and particularly the antiviral drugs currently under clinical trials for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with the challenges and perspectives of this disease are also discussed."
6251,LAMP Diagnostics at the Point-of-Care: Emerging Trends and Perspectives for the Developer Community.,"Introduction: Over the past decade, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology has played an important role in molecular diagnostics. Amongst numerous nucleic acid amplification assays, LAMP stands out in terms of sample-to-answer time, sensitivity, specificity, cost, robustness, and accessibility, making it ideal for field-deployable diagnostics in resource-limited regions.Areas covered: In this review, we outline the front-end LAMP design practices for point-of-care (POC) applications, including sample handling and various signal readout methodologies. Next, we explore existing LAMP technologies that have been validated with clinical samples in the field. We summarize recent work that utilizes reverse transcription (RT) LAMP to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 as an alternative to standard PCR protocols. Finally, we describe challenges in translating LAMP from the benchtop to the field and opportunities for future LAMP assay development and performance reporting.Expert opinion: Despite the popularity of LAMP in the academic research community and a recent surge in interest in LAMP due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are numerous areas for improvement in the fundamental understanding of LAMP, which are needed to elevate the field of LAMP assay development and characterization."
6252,Regulatory consideration on preparation and clinical use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), spreading from Wuhan to worldwide has been emerged since December 2019. Although scientists and researchers have been racing to develop specific therapeutic agents or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 since the identification of the agent, either a drug or a vaccine has not been approved to treat or to prevent COVID-19 up to date. On the base of historical experiences, Convalescent Plasma (CP), a passive antibody therapy, has been evaluated as a hopeful and potential therapeutic option since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Immune plasma had been used previously for the treatment of H1N1 influenza virus, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV epidemics successfully. In this scope competent authorities are responsible to set up certain principles and criteria for the collection and clinical use of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP). This document has been prepared to aid both for the convalescent plasma suppliers and the clinicians. The first part encompasses the supply of CCP and the second part lead the clinical use of CCP for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Turkish Ministry of Health developed a guide on collection and clinical use of CCP and created a web-based monitoring system to follow-up the patients treated with convalescent plasma in universal. This follow-up process is thought to be crucial for the creation and development of current and future treatment modalities. This guide would be a pathfinder for clinicians and/or institutions those eager to conduct CCP treatment more effectively."
6253,Clinical validation of optimised RT-LAMP for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"We have optimised a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from extracted RNA for clinical application. We improved the stability and reliability of the RT-LAMP assay by the addition of a temperature-dependent switch oligonucleotide to reduce self- or off-target amplification. We then developed freeze-dried master mix for single step RT-LAMP reaction, simplifying the operation for end users and improving long-term storage and transportation. The assay can detect as low as 13 copies of SARS-CoV2 RNA per reaction (25-Î¼L). Cross reactivity with other human coronaviruses was not observed. We have applied the new RT-LAMP assay for testing clinical extracted RNA samples extracted from swabs of 72 patients in the UK and 126 samples from Greece and demonstrated the overall sensitivity of 90.2% (95% CI 83.8-94.7%) and specificity of 92.4% (95% CI 83.2-97.5%). Among 115 positive samples which Ct values were less than 34, the RT-LAMP assay was able to detect 110 of them with 95.6% sensitivity. The specificity was 100% when RNA elution used RNase-free water. The outcome of RT-LAMP can be reported by both colorimetric detection and quantifiable fluorescent reading. Objective measures with a digitized reading data flow would allow for the sharing of results for local or national surveillance."
6254,Impact of repeated nasal sampling on detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2.,"The impact of repeated sample collection on COVID-19 test performance is unknown. The FDA and CDC currently recommend the primary collection of diagnostic samples to minimize the perceived risk of false-negative findings. We therefore evaluated the association between repeated sample collection and test performance among 325 symptomatic patients undergoing COVID-19 testing in Atlanta, GA. High concordance was found between consecutively collected mid-turbinate samples with both molecular (n = 74, 100% concordance) and antigen-based (n = 147, 97% concordance, kappa = 0.95, CI = 0.88-1.00) diagnostic assays. Repeated sample collection does not decrease COVID-19 test performance, demonstrating that multiple samples can be collected for assay validation and clinical diagnosis."

6257,Infection Prevention in the Era of COVID-19: 2021 Basic Procedure Review.,"Infection prevention and control practices represent a vital behavioral skill set, especially in the era of COVID-19. Standard precautions, correct use of personal protective equipment, proper hand hygiene, and appropriate cleaning and disinfecting are necessary to prevent health-care-acquired infections in care facilities."
6258,SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 Mutations L452R and E484Q Are Not Synergistic for Antibody Evasion.,"The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 variant emerged in the Indian state of Maharashtra in late 2020. There have been fears that 2 key mutations seen in the receptor-binding domain, L452R and E484Q, would have additive effects on evasion of neutralizing antibodies. We report that spike bearing L452R and E484Q confers modestly reduced sensitivity to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies following either first or second dose. The effect is similar in magnitude to the loss of sensitivity conferred by L452R or E484Q alone. These data demonstrate reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies by L452R and E484Q but lack of synergistic loss of sensitivity."
6259,SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: How much do we know?,"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) globally threatens the public health. COVID-19 is a pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and fatigue. As a novel disease, there are still many unsolved questions regarding COVID-19. Nevertheless, genetic analysis has demonstrated that the virus is strongly associated with certain SARS-like coronavirus originated from bats. The COVID-19 outbreak started in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, but the exact origin of the virus is still highly debatable. Since there is currently no registered antiviral drug for the disease, symptomatic treatments have been applied routinely to manage COVID-19 cases. However, various drugs and vaccines have been currently under research. This review aims to consolidate and discuss the likely origins and genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the recent clinical findings and potential effective treatments of COVID-19. Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCoV; SARS; coronavirus."
