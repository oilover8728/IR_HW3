5390,Autoimmune- and complement-mediated hematologic condition recrudescence following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.,"A variety of autoimmune disorders have been reported after viral illnesses and specific vaccinations. Cases of de novo immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) have been reported after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, although its effect on preexisting ITP has not been well characterized. In addition, although COVID-19 has been associated with complement dysregulation, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on preexisting complementopathies is poorly understood. We sought to better understand SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced recurrence of autoimmune- and complement-mediated hematologic conditions. Three illustrative cases were identified at the University of Washington Medical Center and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance from January through March 2021. We describe the recrudescence of 2 autoimmune conditions (ITP and acquired von Willebrand Disease [AvWD]/acquired hemophilia A) and 1 complementopathy (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH]). We report the first known case of AvWD/acquired hemophilia A, and describe the first PNH exacerbation in the absence of complement inhibition after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced ITP is a known concern, our case clearly depicts how thrombocytopenia in the setting of preexisting ITP can sequentially worsen with each vaccine dose. Based on our experiences and these examples, we provide considerations for how to monitor and assess risk in patients with underlying autoimmune- and complement-mediated hematologic conditions."
5391,The Contribution of Biophysics and Structural Biology to Current Advances in COVID-19.,"Critical to viral infection are the multiple interactions between viral proteins and host-cell counterparts. The first such interaction is the recognition of viral envelope proteins by surface receptors that normally fulfil other physiological roles, a hijacking mechanism perfected over the course of evolution. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has successfully adopted this strategy using its spike glycoprotein to dock on the membrane-bound metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The crystal structures of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins alone or in complex with their receptors or other ligands were recently solved at an unprecedented pace. This accomplishment is partly due to the increasing availability of data on other coronaviruses and ACE2 over the past 18 years. Likewise, other key intervening actors and mechanisms of viral infection were elucidated with the aid of biophysical approaches. An understanding of the various structurally important motifs of the interacting partners provides key mechanistic information for the development of structure-based designer drugs able to inhibit various steps of the infective cycle, including neutralizing antibodies, small organic drugs, and vaccines. This review analyzes current progress and the outlook for future structural studies."
5392,A Case Study: Analysis of Patents on Coronaviruses and Covid-19 for Technological Assessment and Future Research.,"Background: Protecting intellectual property rights are important and particularly pertinent for inventions that are an outcome of rigorous research and development. While the grant of patents is subject to establishing novelty and inventive step, it further indicates the technological development and is helpful for researchers working in the same technical domain. The aim of the present research work is to map the existing work through an analysis of patent literature in the field of Coronaviruses (CoV), particularly COVID-19 (2019-nCoV). CoV is a large family of viruses known to cause illness in humans and animals, particularly known for causing respiratory infections, as evidenced in earlier times, such as in MERS i.e., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; and SRS i.e., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. A recently identified novel-coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has caused pandemic situations across the globe. Objective: To expand the analysis of patents related to CoV and 2019-nCoV, an evaluation has been conducted by patenting trends of particular strains of identified CoV diseases by present legal status, main concerned countries via the earliest priority years and its assignee types and inventors of identified relevant patents. The global patent documents were analyzed to check the scope of claims along with focuses and trends of the published patent documents for the entire CoV family, including 2019-nCoV through the present landscape. Methods: To extract the results, the Derwent Innovation database was used by a combination of different keystrings. Approximately 3800 patents were obtained and further scrutinized and analyzed. The present write-up also discusses the recent progress of patent applications in a period of the year 2010 to 2020 (present) along with the recent developments in India for the treatment options for CoV and 2019-nCoV. Results: Present analysis showed that key areas of the inventions were the vaccines and diagnostic kits apart from the composition for the treatment of CoV. It was also observed that no specific vaccine treatments are available for the treatment of 2019-nCov; however, developing novel chemical or biological drugs and kits for early diagnosis, prevention, and disease management is the primary governing topic among the patented inventions. The present study also indicates potential research opportunities for the future, particularly to combat 2019-nCoV. Conclusion: The present paper analyzes the existing patents in the field of Coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV and suggests a way forward for the effective contribution in this upcoming research area. From the trend analysis, an increase in the filing of the overall trend of patent families was observed for a period of 2010 to the current year. This multifaceted analysis of identified patent literature provides an understanding of the focuses on present ongoing research and a grey area in terms of the trends of technological innovations in disease management in patients with CoV and 2019-nCoV. Furthermore, the findings and outcome of the present study offer insights for the proposed research and innovation opportunities and provide actionable information in order to facilitate policymakers, academia, research-driven institutes and also investors to make better decisions regarding programmed steps for research and development for the diagnosis, treatment and taking preventive measures for CoV and 2019-nCoV. The present article also emphasizes the need for future development and the role of academia and collaboration with industry for speedy research with a rationale."
5393,Sociodemographic predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance: a nationwide US-based survey study.,"Objectives: Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination is attributable to sociodemographic factors and their complex interactions. Attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in the United States are changing frequently, especially since the launch of the vaccines and as the United States faces a third wave of the pandemic. Our primary objective was to determine the relative influence of sociodemographic predictors on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The secondary objectives were to understand the reasons behind vaccine refusal and compare COVID-19 vaccine acceptance with influenza vaccine uptake. Study design: This was a nationwide US-based survey study. Methods: A REDCap survey link was distributed using various online platforms. The primary study outcome was COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (yes/no). Sociodemographic factors, such as age, ethnicity, gender, education, family income, healthcare worker profession, residence regions, local healthcare facility and 'vaccine launch' period (pre vs post), were included as potential predictors. The differences in vaccine acceptance rates among sociodemographic subgroups were estimated by Chi-squared tests, whereas logistic regression and neural networks computed the prediction models and determined the predictors of relative significance. Results: Among 2978 eligible respondents, 81.1% of participants were likely to receive the vaccine. All the predictors demonstrated significant associations with vaccine acceptance, except vaccine launch period. Regression analyses eliminated gender and vaccine launch period from the model, and the machine learning model reproduced the regression result. Both models precisely predicted individual vaccine acceptance and recognised education, ethnicity and age as the most important predictors. Fear of adverse effects and concern with efficacy were the principal reasons for vaccine refusal. Conclusions: Sociodemographic predictors, such as education, ethnicity and age, significantly influenced COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, and concerns of side-effects and efficacy led to increased vaccine hesitancy."

5397,Acute Clinical Syndromes and Suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: The Experience of a Single Romanian Center in the Early Pandemic Period.,"Background and Objectives: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with chronic diseases suffering exacerbations have required acute medical care. The purpose of our study was to determine useful criteria for the differentiation of patients with acute clinical syndromes and suspicion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Materials and Methods: This was an observational retrospective study, conducted in an internal medicine clinic from April to May 2020. We collected clinical, biological, and computed tomography (CT) data on patients with exacerbations of chronic diseases and clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with an already-positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 on presentation at the emergency department were excluded from our study. Results: Of 253 suspected cases, 20 were laboratory-confirmed as having SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, whereas COVID-19 diagnosis was ruled out in the remaining 233. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) correlated significantly with COVID-19 diagnosis in suspected patients, while laboratory markers were not significantly different between the two groups. Of the suspected patients, significantly higher percentages of dry cough, fever, myalgias, sore throat, loss of smell and appetite, and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) on CT were found in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that, until receiving the result of an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (usually 12-24 h), association with VTE as a comorbidity, fever, dry cough, and myalgia as clinical features, and GGO on CT are the main markers for the identification of COVID-19 patients among those suspected with acute clinical syndromes. Our results also provide evidence for doctors not to rely solely on biological markers in the case of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with exacerbations of chronic diseases. These data are useful for faster decision-making with regard to suspected COVID-19 patients before receiving RT-PCR test results, thus avoiding keeping patients in crowded emergency departments."
5398,"Validation of a combined ELISA to detect IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in mild or moderate non-hospitalised patients.","Background: Frequently SARS-CoV-2 results in mild or moderate disease with potentially lower concentrations of antibodies compared to those that are hospitalised. Here, we validated an ELISA using SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein, with targeted detection of IgG, IgA and IgM (IgGAM) using serum and dried blood spots (DBS) from adults with mild or moderate disease. Methods: Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike, a combined anti-IgG, IgA and IgM serology ELISA assay was developed using 62 PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples, ≥14 days post symptom onset and 624 COVID-19 negative samples. The assay was validated using 73 PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples, ≥14 days post symptom onset and 359 COVID-19 negative serum samples with an additional 81 DBSs. The assay was further validated in 226 PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples, ≥14 days post symptom onset and 426 COVID-19 negative clinical samples. Results: A sensitivity and specificity of 98.6% (95% CI, 92.6-100.0), 98.3% (95% CI, 96.4-99.4), respectively, was observed following validation of the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. No cross-reactivities with endemic coronaviruses or other human viruses were observed, and no change in results were recorded for interfering substances. The assay was stable at temperature extremes and components were stable for 15 days once opened. A matrix comparison showed DBS to correlate with serum results. Clinical validation of the assay reported a sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI, 90.9-97.2%) and a specificity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.6-99.3%). Conclusions: The human anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA provides accurate and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in non-hospitalised adults with mild or moderate disease. The use of dried blood spots makes the assay accessible to the wider community."
5399,Early Humoral Responses of Hemodialysis Patients after COVID-19 Vaccination with BNT162b2.,"Background and objectives: Patients receiving hemodialysis are at high risk for both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe coronavirus disease 2019. A lifesaving vaccine is available, but sensitivity to vaccines is generally lower in patients on dialysis. Little is yet known about antibody responses after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in this vulnerable group. Design, setting, participants, and measurements: In this prospective single-center study, we included 22 patients on dialysis and 46 healthy controls from Heidelberg University Hospital between December 2020 and February 2021. We measured anti-S1 IgG with a threshold index for detection greater than one, neutralizing antibodies with a threshold for viral neutralization of ≥30%, and antibodies against different SARS-CoV2 fragments 17-22 days after the first dose and 18-22 days after the second dose of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. Results: After the first vaccine dose, four of 22 (18%) patients on dialysis compared with 43 of 46 (93%) healthy controls developed positive anti-S1 IgG, with a median anti-S1 IgG index of 0.2 (interquartile range, 0.1-0.7) compared with nine (interquartile range, 4-16), respectively. SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies exceeded the threshold for neutralization in four of 22 (18%) patients on dialysis compared with 43 of 46 (93%) healthy controls, with a median percent inhibition of 11 (interquartile range, 3-24) compared with 65 (interquartile range, 49-75), respectively. After the second dose, 14 of 17 (82%) patients on dialysis developed neutralizing antibodies exceeding the threshold for viral neutralization and antibodies against the receptor binding S1 domain of the spike protein, compared with 46 of 46 (100%) healthy controls, respectively. The median percent inhibition was 51 (interquartile range, 32-86) compared with 98 (interquartile range, 97-98) in healthy controls. Conclusions: Patients receiving long-term hemodialysis show a reduced antibody response to the first and second doses of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. The majority (82%) develop neutralizing antibodies after the second dose but at lower levels than healthy controls."
