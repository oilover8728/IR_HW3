Wastewater monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent responsible for COVID-19, has emerged as a promising tool for health officials to anticipate outbreaks. As interest in wastewater monitoring continues to grow and municipalities begin to implement this approach, there is a need to further identify and evaluate methods used to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA from wastewater samples. Here we evaluate the recovery, cost, and throughput of five different concentration methods for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in wastewater samples. We tested the five methods on six different wastewater samples. We also evaluated the use of a bovine coronavirus vaccine as a process control and pepper mild mottle virus as a normalization factor. Of the five methods we tested head-to-head, we found that HA filtration with bead beating performed the best in terms of sensitivity and cost. This evaluation can serve as a guide for laboratories establishing a protocol to perform wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2."
3233,Immuno-informatics approach for B-cell and T-cell epitope based peptide vaccine design against novel COVID-19 virus.,"COVID-19 has brought the world to a standstill with a wave of destruction in country after country with tremendous loss of lives and livelihood in advanced to developing nations. Whole world is staring at the prospect of repeated lockdowns with another wave of COVID-19 predicted to hit the world in September of 2020. The second wave is assumed to be even more destructive with severe impact across much of the world. The only way to defeat this pandemic is to quickly develop a safe and effective vaccine against this raging menace and initiate a global vaccination drive. Our study is an attempt to deploy various computational methods to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes from the spike surface glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2 which have the novel potential for vaccine development against COVID-19. For this we have taken 8 unique strains with one each from India, China, France, USA, Italy, Australia, Iran and Pakistan. The strain data was extracted from NCBI Database. By analyzing the immune parameters like surface accessibility, antigenicity, variability, conservancy, flexibility, hydrophilicity, allergenicity and toxicity of the conserved sequences of spike glycoprotein using various databases and bioinformatics tools, we identified two potential novel linear (SGTNGTKRFDN and ASVYAWNRK) and one structural B-cell epitope as well as two T-cell epitopes (RLFRKSNLK and IPTNFTISV) which can be used as epitope-based peptide vaccines. Docking simulation assay revealed that above T-cell epitopes have minimum free binding energy and showed strong hydrogen bond interaction which strengthened its potential as being a T-cell epitope for the epitope-based novel vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This study allows us to claim that B-cell and T-cell epitopes mentioned above provide potential pathways for developing an exploratory vaccine against spike surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 with high confidence for the identified strains. We will need to confirm our findings with biological assays."
3234,The Positive Rhinovirus/Enterovirus Detection and SARS-CoV-2 Persistence beyond the Acute Infection Phase: An Intra-Household Surveillance Study.,We aimed to assess the duration of nasopharyngeal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA persistence in adults self-confined at home after acute infection; and to identify the associations of SARS-CoV-2 persistence with respiratory virus co-detection and infection transmission. A cross-sectional intra-household study was conducted in metropolitan Barcelona (Spain) during the time period of April to June 2020. Every adult who was the first family member reported as SARS-CoV-2-positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as well as their household child contacts had nasopharyngeal swabs tested by a targeted SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and a multiplex viral respiratory panel after a 15 day minimum time lag. Four-hundred and four households (404 adults and 708 children) were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 137 (33.9%) adults and 84 (11.9%) children. Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (RV/EV) was commonly found (83.3%) in co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in adults. The mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in adults' nasopharynx was 52 days (range 26-83 days). The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly associated with RV/EV co-infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 9.31; 95% CI 2.57-33.80) and SARS-CoV-2 detection in child contacts (aOR 2.08; 95% CI 1.24-3.51). Prolonged nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistence beyond the acute infection phase was frequent in adults quarantined at home during the first epidemic wave; which was associated with RV/EV co-infection and could enhance intra-household infection transmission.
3235,Key points to keep in mind related to COVID-19 vaccines in people with multiple sclerosis.,"Vaccinations are often the most effective tool against certain diseases known to mankind, and their interaction with multiple sclerosis (MS) has been discussed for decades. With rapidly accumulating numbers of cases and deaths due to COVID-19, there is a global effort to respond to this pandemic in terms of scale and speed. Different platforms are currently being used around the world for the development of best COVID-19 vaccine. While some COVID-19 vaccines have already been approved by different regulatory agencies, there is scarce data in large cohorts regarding the efficacy and security of COVID-19 vaccines in people with MS. In this short review we aimed the most important information to keep in mind regarding this topic."
3236,Preliminary evidence of blunted humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in multiple sclerosis patients treated with ocrelizumab.,"Objectives: Several concerns regard the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), since the majority of them is treated with immunomodulating/immunosuppressive disease modifying therapies. Here we report the first data on the humoral response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a case series of 4 pwMS treated with ocrelizumab (OCR) as compared to a group of healthy subjects (HS). Methods: We collected serum samples at 0, 14, 21 days after the first dose and 7 days after the second dose of BNT162b2-mRNA-Covid-19 vaccine from 55 health-care workers and 4 relapsing pwMS on OCR, with no history of Covid-19 infection. Sera were tested using the LIAISONÂ®SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS-IgG assay (DiaSorin-S.p.A.) for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The anti-spike IgGtiters were expressed in Binding Antibody Units (BAU), an international standard unit. Results: At baseline all subjects were negative for anti-spike IgG. Seven days after the second dose of vaccine all HS mounted a significant humoral response (geometric mean 2010.4 BAU/mL C.I. 95% 1512.7-2672) while the 4 pwMS showed a lower response (range <4.81-175 BAU/mL). Discussion: Humoral response to BNT162b2-mRNA-vaccine in pwMS treated with OCR was clearly blunted. Further data are urgently needed to confirm and expand these preliminary results and to develop strategies to optimize the response to SARSCoV-2 vaccines in pwMS on OCR."
