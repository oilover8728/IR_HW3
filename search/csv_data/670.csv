6690,Proteotyping SARS-CoV-2 Virus from Nasopharyngeal Swabs: A Proof-of-Concept Focused on a 3 Min Mass Spectrometry Window.,"Rapid but yet sensitive, specific, and high-throughput detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in clinical samples is key to diagnose infected people and to better control the spread of the virus. Alternative methodologies to PCR and immunodiagnostics that would not require specific reagents are worthy to investigate not only for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic but also to detect other emergent pathogenic threats. Here, we propose the use of tandem mass spectrometry to detect SARS-CoV-2 marker peptides in nasopharyngeal swabs. We documented that the signal from the microbiota present in such samples is low and can be overlooked when interpreting shotgun proteomic data acquired on a restricted window of the peptidome landscape. In this proof-of-concept study, simili nasopharyngeal swabs spiked with different quantities of purified SARS-CoV-2 viral material were used to develop a nanoLC-MS/MS acquisition method, which was then successfully applied on COVID-19 clinical samples. We argue that peptides ADETQALPQR and GFYAQGSR from the nucleocapsid protein are of utmost interest as their signal is intense and their elution can be obtained within a 3 min window in the tested conditions. These results pave the way for the development of time-efficient viral diagnostic tests based on mass spectrometry."
6691,"Opinions, beliefs and knowledge of people with multiple sclerosis on COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine.","Background: Considering the potential COVID-19 impact on pwMS health and the importance of vaccination for this population, we decided to assess: (a) pwMS' beliefs and knowledge on COVID-19 pandemic; (b) their acceptance towards COVID-19 vaccination and (c) pwMS' opinions on general vaccination. Methods: Observational study, based on a cross-sectional (10-20th September 2020) online survey, conducted in a cohort of pwMS' followed at two Portuguese hospitals. The survey included measures to characterize the sample and a questionnaire designed to assess the topics defined for this study. Results: 270 respondents completed the full survey (response rate 58.2%). pwMS greatest concern during the pandemic was an aggravation of MS, especially by patients older than 50 years old. Almost 40% of the patients older than 50 felt that the pandemic negatively affected their MS related medical assistance. Most patients believed they would recover from COVID-19 infection. More than half of the responders feared a MS aggravation if they got COVID-19; this was more pronounced in patients with progressive MS. About 12% of the participants did not want to be vaccinated and almost 40% was unsure. Regarding vaccines in general, almost a third of the participants feared their side effects or MS related complications. Conclusion: Having knowledge of pwMS' opinions on COVID-19 pandemic impact and vaccination is useful to better address these issues. Fears and expectations towards vaccination must be discussed with pwMS."

6693,Human cell receptors: potential drug targets to combat COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that COVID-19 is a pandemic having a higher spread rate rather than the mortality. Identification of a potential approach or therapy against COVID-19 is still under consideration. Therefore, it is essential to have an insight into SARS-CoV-2, its interacting partner, and domains for an effective treatment. The present study is divided into three main categories, including SARS-CoV-2 prominent receptor and its expression levels, other interacting partners, and their binding domains. The first section focuses primarily on coronaviruses' general aspects (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses (MERS-CoV)) their structures, similarities, and mode of infections. The second section discusses the host receptors which includes the human targets of coronaviruses like dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), CD147, CD209L, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), and other miscellaneous targets (type-II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), furin, trypsin, cathepsins, thermolysin, elastase, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase, two-pore segment channel, and epithelium sodium channel C-Î± subunit). The human cell receptor, ACE2 plays an essential role in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) pathway and COVID-19. Thus, this section also discusses the ACE2 expression and risk of COVID-19 infectivity in various organs and tissues such as the liver, lungs, intestine, heart, and reproductive system in the human body. Absence of ACE2 protein expression in immune cells could be used for limiting the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The third section covers the current available approaches for COVID-19 treatment. Overall, this review focuses on the critical role of human cell receptors involved in coronavirus pathogenesis, which would likely be used in designing target-specific drugs to combat COVID-19."
6694,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 infection: A review of the clinical-pathological correlations of Coronavirus disease-19 in children.,"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic of acute respiratory disease in just less than a year by the middle of 2020. This disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities. In contrast, children are relatively spared of this potentially ravaging disease that culminates in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces exuberant release of pro-inflammatory mediators, causing a ""cytokine storm"" and hypercoagulable states that underlie these complications. The SARS-CoV-2 infection median incubation is 5.1 days, with most developing symptoms by 11.5 days. It is highly infectious, spreading via the horizontal mode of transmission, but there is yet very limited evidence of vertical transmission to the newborn infant occurring either transplacentally or through breastfeeding. This said, various immune factors during childhood may modulate the expression of COVID-19, with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at the severe end of the disease spectrum. This article gives an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical presentation and laboratory tests of COVID-19 and correlating with the current understanding of the pathological basis of this disease in the paediatric population."
6695,The Health and Social Needs of Patients Discharged From the Emergency Department With Suspected COVID-19.,"Health-related social needs (HRSNs), such as food or housing insecurity, are important drivers of disparities in outcomes during public health emergencies. We describe the development of a telehealth follow-up program in Boston, Massachusetts, for patients discharged from the emergency department after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing to identify patients with worsening clinical symptoms, to screen for unmet HRSNs, and to deliver self-isolation counseling and risk-reduction strategies for socially vulnerable people. We prioritized telephone calls to patients with public health insurance and patients without primary care physicians. In the first 43 days of operation, March 30-May 12, 2020, our intervention reached 509 patients, with 209 (41.1%) patients reporting an HRSN, most commonly related to food, housing, or utilities. Thirty-one (6.1%) patients required assessment by a clinician for clinical worsening. This public health intervention may be useful for other institutions developing programs to address the social and health needs of patients discharged with suspected COVID-19."
6696,"Covid-19 vaccine, acceptance, and concern of safety from public perspective in the state of Odisha, India.","Introduction: No medication or therapies were found to be effective in controlling the covid-19 pandemic. The fast-track development of covid-19 vaccine brought some hope among health practitioners globally. The major challenge seems to be safety, efficacy, and acceptance of the vaccine. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among the community of the state of Odisha, India, to find out the concerns of safety and acceptance for the vaccine.Methods: A self-administered multiple-choice questionnaire containing 23 items with three sections was prepared in Google form and deployed following snow ball sampling method. The participants recruited were above 18 years of age residing in Odisha. The participation in the survey was completely voluntary. The survey was conducted during February 2021.Results and discussion: In total, 359 members participated in the survey. Majority of the respondent strongly agree/agree that covid-19 vaccine is safe for adults and children. Significant variation among all the groups was found regarding acquisition of higher immunity following infection rather by vaccination, effectiveness in infection prevention, safety in children, provision of mandatory vaccination by government, and public health protection following government guidelines.Conclusion: The major barrier to the covid-19 vaccination was found to be safety and awareness. But there is well acceptance to covid-19 vaccine among the community of Odisha, India, and further efforts to create awareness concerning safety and vaccination will be instrumental in the eradication of this infection."
6697,Rapid electrochemical detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), which is time-consuming and requires expensive instrumentation. Here, we report an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor based on isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA) for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. The assay involves the hybridization of the RCA amplicons with probes that were functionalized with redox active labels that are detectable by an electrochemical biosensor. The one-step sandwich hybridization assay could detect as low as 1 copy/Î¼L of N and S genes, in less than 2 h. Sensor evaluation with 106 clinical samples, including 41 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 9 samples positive for other respiratory viruses, gave a 100% concordance result with qRT-PCR, with complete correlation between the biosensor current signals and quantitation cycle (Cq) values. In summary, this biosensor could be used as an on-site, real-time diagnostic test for COVID-19."
6698,COVID-19 reinfection: a rapid systematic review of case reports and case series.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people worldwide and many countries have been suffering from a large number of deaths. Acknowledging the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to mutate into distinct strains as an RNA virus and investigating its potential to cause reinfection is important for future health policy guidelines. It was thought that individuals who recovered from COVID-19 generate a robust immune response and develop protective immunity; however, since the first case of documented reinfection of COVID-19 in August 2020, there have been a number of cases with reinfection. Many cases are lacking genomic data of the two infections, and it remains unclear whether they were caused by different strains. In the present study, we undertook a rapid systematic review to identify cases infected with different genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR and viral genome sequencing. A total of 17 cases of genetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection were found. One immunocompromised patient had mild symptoms with the first infection but developed severe symptoms resulting in death with the second infection. Overall, 68.8% (11/16) had similar severity; 18.8% (3/16) had worse symptoms; and 12.5% (2/16) had milder symptoms with the second episode. Our case series shows that reinfection with different strains is possible, and some cases may experience more severe infections with the second episode. The findings also suggest that COVID-19 may continue to circulate even after achieving herd immunity through natural infection or vaccination, suggesting the need for longer-term transmission mitigation efforts."
6699,"""Molecular Masks"" for ACE2 to Effectively and Safely Block SARS-CoV-2 Virus Entry.","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a global health crisis, despite the development and success of vaccines in certain countries. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, uses its spike protein to bind to the human cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which allows the virus to enter the human body. Using our unique cell screening technology, we identified two ACE2-binding peptoid compounds and developed dimeric derivatives (ACE2P1D1 and ACE2P2D1) that effectively blocked spike protein-ACE2 interaction, resulting in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into human cells. ACE2P1D1 and ACE2P2D1 also blocked infection by a D614G mutant pseudovirus. More importantly, these compounds do not decrease ACE2 expression nor its enzyme activity (which is important in normal blood pressure regulation), suggesting safe applicability in humans."
