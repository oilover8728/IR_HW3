9380,Acute respiratory distress syndrome: a life threatening associated complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection inducing COVID-19.,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a form of respiratory failure in human. The number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection inducing this severe pneumonia (ARDS) is relatively high. In fact, COVID-19 might get worsen in ARDS and provoke respiratory failure. A better understood of ARDS key features and the pathophysiological injuries of the pulmonary parenchyma are linked to lessons learned from previous severe diseases associated previous coronaviruses outbreaks (especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and more the ongoing SARS-CoV-2. The ARDS mechanism includes a diffuse alveolar damage associated disruption of alveolar capillary membrane, pulmonary edema, damaged endothelium and increased permeability. A diffuse inflammation, with acute onset, on the lung tissue accompanied by release of biochemical signal and inflammatory mediators (TNFÎ±, IL-1 and IL-6) leading to hypoxemia, low PaO2/FiO2 ratio and the chest radiological expression of bilateral infiltrates in ARDS. The ongoing outbreak could lead to a better understood of ARDS pathophysiology and prognostic. An overview is also highlighted about the seven coronaviruses proved to infect human especially those having ability to cause severe disease SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we focused on the major pathological mechanisms leading to the ARDS development as a result of viral infection, severe COVID-19 worsening. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
9381,COVID-19 CG enables SARS-CoV-2 mutation and lineage tracking by locations and dates of interest.,"COVID-19 CG (covidcg.org) is an open resource for tracking SARS-CoV-2 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), lineages, and clades using the virus genomes on the GISAID database while filtering by location, date, gene, and mutation of interest. COVID-19 CG provides significant time, labor, and cost-saving utility to projects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, evolution, diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and intervention tracking. Here, we describe case studies in which users can interrogate (1) SNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) across different geographical regions to inform the design and testing of therapeutics, (2) SNVs that may impact the sensitivity of commonly used diagnostic primers, and (3) the emergence of a dominant lineage harboring an S477N RBD mutation in Australia in 2020. To accelerate COVID-19 efforts, COVID-19 CG will be upgraded with new features for users to rapidly pinpoint mutations as the virus evolves throughout the pandemic and in response to therapeutic and public health interventions."

9383,Role of Oxidative Stress on SARS-CoV (SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Infection: A Review.,"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several studies have suggested that a precise disulfide-thiol balance is crucial for viral entry and fusion into the host cell and that oxidative stress generated from free radicals can affect this balance. Here, we reviewed the current knowledge about the role of oxidative stress on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. We focused on the impact of antioxidants, like NADPH and glutathione, and redox proteins, such as thioredoxin and protein disulfide isomerase, that maintain the disulfide-thiol balance in the cell. The possible influence of these biomolecules on the binding of viral protein with the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor protein as well as on the severity of COVID-19 infection was discussed."
9384,A hybrid computational framework for intelligent inter-continent SARS-CoV-2 sub-strains characterization and prediction.,"Whereas accelerated attention beclouded early stages of the coronavirus spread, knowledge of actual pathogenicity and origin of possible sub-strains remained unclear. By harvesting the Global initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ), between December 2019 and January 15, 2021, a total of 8864 human SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences processed by gender, across 6 continents (88 countries) of the world, Antarctica exempt, were analyzed. We hypothesized that data speak for itself and can discern true and explainable patterns of the disease. Identical genome diversity and pattern correlates analysis performed using a hybrid of biotechnology and machine learning methods corroborate the emergence of inter- and intra- SARS-CoV-2 sub-strains transmission and sustain an increase in sub-strains within the various continents, with nucleotide mutations dynamically varying between individuals in close association with the virus as it adapts to its host/environment. Interestingly, some viral sub-strain patterns progressively transformed into new sub-strain clusters indicating varying amino acid, and strong nucleotide association derived from same lineage. A novel cognitive approach to knowledge mining helped the discovery of transmission routes and seamless contact tracing protocol. Our classification results were better than state-of-the-art methods, indicating a more robust system for predicting emerging or new viral sub-strain(s). The results therefore offer explanations for the growing concerns about the virus and its next wave(s). A future direction of this work is a defuzzification of confusable pattern clusters for precise intra-country SARS-CoV-2 sub-strains analytics."
9385,Telmisartan as tentative angiotensin receptor blocker therapeutic for COVID-19.,"In late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung complications similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus in the 2002-2003 epidemic. This new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the airway and binds, by means of the S protein on its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells. The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7. High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade, leading eventually to ARDS. Recently, Gurwitz proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients prior to development of ARDS. In this commentary article, the authors make the case for the election of telmisartan as such alternative on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and present an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients (NCT04355936)."
9386,Airborne transmission of COVID-19 and the role of face mask to prevent it: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background and aims: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belonging to the Coronaviridae family, is agent of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, in early December 2019 and is now considered a pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the airborne transmission of COVID-19 and the role of face mask to prevent it. Methods: A systematic search for English-language literature was done via PUBMED/Medline and Google Scholar up to October 2020. There was two search strategy; for airborne transmission and the role of face mask for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on a fixed and random effects model, the RR and 95% CI were used to evaluate the combined risk. This meta-analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Guidelines. Results: After eligibility assessment, four articles with a total of 7688 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The result of this meta-analysis has shown significant reduction in infection with face mask use; the pooled RR (95%CI) was 0.12 [0.06, 0.27] (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that there is association between face mask use and reduction of COVID-19. However, COVID-19 spreads primarily with contact routes and respiratory droplets, but its transmissibility has many mysteries yet and there is controversy about airborne transmission of COVID-19."
9387,Positive Stool Test Results Suggest that the Discharge Standard for COVID-19 Needs Improvement.,"We report on a hospitalized patient with 2019 novel coronavirus disease whose fecal samples tested negative 22 days after respiratory samples tested negative, highlighting that the duration of viral shedding is longer than that previously expected. Current clinical examinations for treatment and discharge standards are limited to respiratory samples. However, we believe that nucleic acid testing of both respiratory and fecal samples is necessary for discharging patients. Further studies are needed to confirm the potential of fecal-oral transmission or fecal-respiratory transmission via aerosols."
9388,Impaired humoral and cellular immunity after SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 (tozinameran) prime-boost vaccination in kidney transplant recipients.,"Novel mRNA-based vaccines have been proven to be powerful tools in combating the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, with BNT162b2 (trade name: Comirnaty) efficiently protecting individuals from COVID-19 across a broad age range. Still, it remains largely unknown how renal insufficiency and immunosuppressive medication affect development of vaccine-induced immunity. We therefore comprehensively analyzed humoral and cellular responses in kidney transplant recipients after the standard second vaccination dose. As opposed to all healthy vaccinees and the majority of hemodialysis patients, only 4 of 39 and 1 of 39 transplanted individuals showed IgA and IgG seroconversion at day 8 Â± 1 after booster immunization, with minor changes until day 23 Â± 5, respectively. Although most transplanted patients mounted spike-specific T helper cell responses, frequencies were significantly reduced compared with those in controls and dialysis patients and this was accompanied by a broad impairment in effector cytokine production, memory differentiation, and activation-related signatures. Spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses were less abundant than their CD4+ counterparts in healthy controls and hemodialysis patients and almost undetectable in transplant patients. Promotion of anti-HLA antibodies or acute rejection was not detected after vaccination. In summary, our data strongly suggest revised vaccination approaches in immunosuppressed patients, including individual immune monitoring for protection of this vulnerable group at risk of developing severe COVID-19."
9389,Pulsed Broad-Spectrum UV Light Effectively Inactivates SARS-CoV-2 on Multiple Surfaces and N95 Material.,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in an increased need for technologies capable of efficiently disinfecting public spaces as well as personal protective equipment. UV light disinfection is a well-established method for inactivating respiratory viruses. Here, we have determined that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on multiple surfaces in vitro. For hard, non-porous surfaces, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 was inactivated to undetectable levels on plastic and glass with a UV dose of 34.9 mJ/cm2 and stainless steel with a dose of 52.5 mJ/cm2. We also observed that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirator material to undetectable levels with a dose of 103 mJ/cm2. We included UV dosimeter cards that provide a colorimetric readout of UV dose and demonstrated their utility as a means to confirm desired levels of exposure were reached. Together, the results presented here demonstrate that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is an effective technology for the in vitro inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on multiple surfaces."
