4770,Serological evidence of human infection with SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: A rapidly increasing number of serological surveys for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported worldwide. We aimed to synthesise, combine, and assess this large corpus of data. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and five preprint servers for articles published in English between Dec 1, 2019, and Dec 22, 2020. Studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in humans after the first identified case in the area were included. Studies that only reported serological responses among patients with COVID-19, those using known infection status samples, or any animal experiments were all excluded. All data used for analysis were extracted from included papers. Study quality was assessed using a standardised scale. We estimated age-specific, sex-specific, and race-specific seroprevalence by WHO regions and subpopulations with different levels of exposures, and the ratio of serology-identified infections to virologically confirmed cases. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020198253. Findings: 16 506 studies were identified in the initial search, 2523 were assessed for eligibility after removal of duplicates and inappropriate titles and abstracts, and 404 serological studies (representing tests in 5 168 360 individuals) were included in the meta-analysis. In the 82 studies of higher quality, close contacts (18·0%, 95% CI 15·7-20·3) and high-risk health-care workers (17·1%, 9·9-24·4) had higher seroprevalence than did low-risk health-care workers (4·2%, 1·5-6·9) and the general population (8·0%, 6·8-9·2). The heterogeneity between included studies was high, with an overall I2 of 99·9% (p<0·0001). Seroprevalence varied greatly across WHO regions, with the lowest seroprevalence of general populations in the Western Pacific region (1·7%, 95% CI 0·0-5·0). The pooled infection-to-case ratio was similar between the region of the Americas (6·9, 95% CI 2·7-17·3) and the European region (8·4, 6·5-10·7), but higher in India (56·5, 28·5-112·0), the only country in the South-East Asia region with data. Interpretation: Antibody-mediated herd immunity is far from being reached in most settings. Estimates of the ratio of serologically detected infections per virologically confirmed cases across WHO regions can help provide insights into the true proportion of the population infected from routine confirmation data.

4771,Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine: need of a reasoned and effective vaccine campaign.,"Objectives: A strong COVID-19 vaccine campaign is needed to reach the herd immunity and reduce this pandemic infection. Study design: In the Foch Hospital, France, in February 2021, 451 healthcare workers were vaccinated by a first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine. Methods: Adverse effects were reported to our pharmaco-vigilance circuit, by an online and anonymous questionnaire following the first weeks of the vaccinal campaign to healthcare workers. Results: Two hundred seventy-four (60.8%) of them reported multiple adverse effects. Main adverse effects reported were feverish state/chills (65.7%), fatigue/physical discomfort (62.4%), arthralgia/muscle pain (61.0%) and fever (44.5%). Conclusions: On March 2021 many European countries suspended AstraZeneca vaccine for one week due to safety uncertainty. Thus, confidence in its efficacy is undermined. However, the benefit/risk balance is clearly in favor of vaccination."
4772,The Antigenicity of Epidemic SARS-CoV-2 Variants in the United Kingdom.,"To determine whether the neutralization activity of monoclonal antibodies, convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera was affected by the top five epidemic SARS-CoV-2 variants in the UK, including D614G+L18F+A222V, D614G+A222V, D614G+S477N, VOC-202012/01(B.1.1.7) and D614G+69-70del+N439K, a pseudovirus-neutralization assay was performed to evaluate the relative neutralization titers against the five SARS-CoV-2 variants and 12 single deconvolution mutants based on the variants. In this study, 18 monoclonal antibodies, 10 sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients, 10 inactivated-virus vaccine-elicited sera, 14 mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, nine RBD-immunized mouse sera, four RBD-immunized horse sera, and four spike-encoding DNA-immunized guinea pig sera were tested and analyzed. The N501Y, N439K, and S477N mutations caused immune escape from nine of 18 mAbs. However, the convalescent sera, inactivated virus vaccine-elicited sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, spike DNA-elicited sera, and recombinant RBD protein-elicited sera could still neutralize these variants (within three-fold changes compared to the reference D614G variant). The neutralizing antibody responses to different types of vaccines were different, whereby the response to inactivated-virus vaccine was similar to the convalescent sera."
4773,Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Race in Dermatology.,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic/Latino populations. Racial disparities inherently exist in dermatology because of underrepresentation of skin of color populations in literature, reduced access to care for minority populations, and low diversity within the specialty of dermatology itself. Lack of imagery in dermatology can have detrimental consequences for patients of color. Dermatologists should note and disseminate cutaneous manifestations of patients of color to combat current racial imbalances."
4774,2019 Novel Coronavirus Vaccination among Post-graduate Residents and Fellows.,"Background: Coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) has caused a worldwide pandemic since December 2019. Since then, clinical trials with vaccines have been started and completed, and at present, 3 COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use in the United States. Healthcare providers were among the first to get vaccinated, but the precise attitudes of healthcare workers toward vaccination are uncertain. Objective: To understand residents and fellows' attitudes toward vaccination and record any side effects after vaccination. Methods: We conducted an anonymous survey that was open from 3-1-2021 to 3-12-2021 using distribution lists from the Graduate Medical Education office on the Lubbock campus of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center after getting approval from the Institutional Review Board (L21-088). Results: Eighty-one residents and fellows (26.6% out of 304) responded to our survey. Among those who responded, 63 (77.8 %) were between 25 and 35 years old, and 41 (50.6%) were males. Seventy-seven (95.1%) received the vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), 78 (96.3%) reported that they supported vaccination, and 3 (3.7%) reported that they did not want vaccination. Eight members (9.8%) had tested positive for COVID-19 infection before vaccination, but only 1 (1.23%) had tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. All residents and fellows reported side effects after the vaccination, including pain at the injection site (77; 100%), local redness (9; 11.6%), local swelling (13; 16.8%), fever (25; 32.5%), fatigue (25; 32.5%), chills (34; 44.1 %), headache (38; 49.4%). Conclusions: Most medical trainees have a high interest in COVID-19 vaccination; however, a few reported that they did not want vaccination."
4775,The granting of emergency use designation to COVID-19 candidate vaccines: implications for COVID-19 vaccine trials.,"An efficacious COVID-19 vaccine is currently the world's leading research priority. Several nations have indicated that if there is a compelling case for use of a vaccine before it is licensed, they would be prepared to authorise its emergency use or conditional approval on public health grounds. As of Dec 1, 2020, several developers of leading COVID-19 candidate vaccines have indicated that they have applied, or intend to apply, for emergency authorisation for their vaccines. Should candidate vaccines attain emergency use designation and be programmatically deployed before their phase 3 trials conclude, such a strategy could have far reaching consequences for COVID-19 vaccine research and the effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic. These issues merit careful consideration."
4776,Retinal imaging study diagnoses in COVID-19: a case report.,"Background: Hyperreflective lesions at the level of ganglion cell (GCL) and inner plexiform retinal layers (IPL) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and cotton wool spots in the examination of the eye fundus have recently been described as findings in patients with COVID-19 infection. Case report: We report the case of a 42-year-old healthy Caucasian male anesthetist who had treated COVID-19 patients during the previous 5 weeks and suddenly presented with a temporal relative scotoma in his left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 for the left eye, and no discromatopsy or afferent pupillary defect was present. Visual field test was performed, with no significant findings associated with the focal loss of sensitivity described by the patient. The anterior segment was unremarkable on slit lamp examination in both eyes. Fundus examination of the left eye showed no significant findings. A placoid, hyperreflective band at the level of the GCL and IPL was visible in OCT which spared the outer retina, at the time of diagnosis and 1 month later. An oropharyngeal swab test was performed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) determination. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was negative. ELISA testing and a third rapid antibody detection test performed 7 days after the onset of symptoms were positive. Conclusions: Ocular signs and symptoms in COVID-19 cases are rarely reported, but may be underestimated, especially those that affect the retina and occur in asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases. We present a case of COVID-19 diagnosis based on retinal ophthalmic examination."
4777,"Self-supervised deep learning model for COVID-19 lung CT image segmentation highlighting putative causal relationship among age, underlying disease and COVID-19.","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is very contagious. Cases appear faster than the available Polymerase Chain Reaction test kits in many countries. Recently, lung computerized tomography (CT) has been used as an auxiliary COVID-19 testing approach. Automatic analysis of the lung CT images is needed to increase the diagnostic efficiency and release the human participant. Deep learning is successful in automatically solving computer vision problems. Thus, it can be introduced to the automatic and rapid COVID-19 CT diagnosis. Many advanced deep learning-based computer vison techniques were developed to increase the model performance but have not been introduced to medical image analysis. Methods: In this study, we propose a self-supervised two-stage deep learning model to segment COVID-19 lesions (ground-glass opacity and consolidation) from chest CT images to support rapid COVID-19 diagnosis. The proposed deep learning model integrates several advanced computer vision techniques such as generative adversarial image inpainting, focal loss, and lookahead optimizer. Two real-life datasets were used to evaluate the model's performance compared to the previous related works. To explore the clinical and biological mechanism of the predicted lesion segments, we extract some engineered features from the predicted lung lesions. We evaluate their mediation effects on the relationship of age with COVID-19 severity, as well as the relationship of underlying diseases with COVID-19 severity using statistic mediation analysis. Results: The best overall F1 score is observed in the proposed self-supervised two-stage segmentation model (0.63) compared to the two related baseline models (0.55, 0.49). We also identified several CT image phenotypes that mediate the potential causal relationship between underlying diseases with COVID-19 severity as well as the potential causal relationship between age with COVID-19 severity. Conclusions: This work contributes a promising COVID-19 lung CT image segmentation model and provides predicted lesion segments with potential clinical interpretability. The model could automatically segment the COVID-19 lesions from the raw CT images with higher accuracy than related works. The features of these lesions are associated with COVID-19 severity through mediating the known causal of the COVID-19 severity (age and underlying diseases)."
4778,Vaccine nationalism: a predicament in ending the COVID-19 pandemic.,"In a recent correspondence, vaccine hesitancy and its pressing issue in possible delaying of being triumphant in the pandemic was discussed. This paper highlights vaccine nationalism as a predicament that would not just delay but worsen the present situation of the pandemic. This study suggests a global response among countries that people must see the world as a global village and as one community it must save collectively."
