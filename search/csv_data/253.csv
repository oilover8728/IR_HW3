2523,Extreme immunotherapy: emergency immunology to defeat pandemics.,"The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has thrown into sharp relief the gap between modern biology's ability to investigate and respond to a novel pathogen and modern medicine's ability to marshal effective front-line interventions to limit its immediate health impact. While we have witnessed the rapid development of innovative vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 using novel molecular platforms, these have yet to alter the pandemic's long-term trajectory in all but a handful of high-income countries. Health workers at the clinical front lines have little more in their clinical armamentarium than was available a century ago-chiefly oxygen and steroids-and yet advances in modern immunology and immunotherapeutics suggest an underuse of extant and effective, if unorthodox, therapies, which we now call ""Extreme Immunotherapies for Pandemics (EIPs)."""
2524,[Intracerebral haemorrhage twelve days after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19].,"The COVID-19-pandemic has had a huge impact on health and economics all over the world resulting in widespread vaccine development. Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytropenia has been described, suggesting a link between the two adeno-vector vaccines ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria from AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2-S (Janssen from Johnson and Johnson). This rare clinical condition should be suspected in patients with headache, abdominal pain, suspected thrombosis or hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia within 3-30-day post vaccine. In this case report a previously healthy man had thrombocytopenia with fatal intracerebral haemorrhage which was suspected to be related to vaccine."
2525,Hydroxychloroquine Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers from India: A Meta-Analysis.,"To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 200 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than four million deaths world-wide. 1 Although novel COVID-19 vaccines have become clinically available, the safety and efficacy of these vaccines remains open to question. 2 Alternate approaches to prevention of disease have received little attention, and one medication, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), has been attacked and dismissed based on flawed studies and political controversy that obscured the value of this treatment as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection."
2526,Serological cross-reaction and coinfection of dengue and COVID-19 in Asia: Experience from Indonesia.,"Similar symptoms and laboratory findings between dengue and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pose a diagnostic challenge in some dengue-endemic countries in Asia. In this study, we reported three cases of suspected COVID-19-dengue coinfection in hospitals of Bali, Indonesia. Serological data demonstrated that patients with positive results for dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen and anti-dengue IgM were also reactive to COVID-19 rapid antibody tests, suggesting dengue-COVID-19 coinfection. However, two patients were later confirmed negative for SARS-COV-2 by qRT-PCR, implying a plausible cross-reactivity of anti-dengue and anti-COVID-19 antibodies in the serological test. Coinfection of dengue and COVID-19 was evident in one patient, following confirmation of SARS-COV-2 by qRT-PCR and DENV infection using the NS1 antigen serology test. This case was the first case of dengue and COVID-19 coinfection in Indonesia and revealed possible cross-reactivity between SARS-COV-2 and DENV antibodies based on rapid serological tests. Our study indicates a public health concern regarding COVID-19 and dengue detection in Indonesia as well as in other dengue-endemic countries, and it is important for these nations to manage both pathogens concurrently."

2528,COVID-19 vaccines: Keeping pace with SARS-CoV-2 variants.,"As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolves, new variants continue to emerge. Some highly transmissible variants, such as Delta, also raised concerns about the effectiveness provided by current vaccines. Understanding immunological correlates of protection and how laboratory findings correspond to clinical effectiveness is imperative to shape future vaccination strategies."
