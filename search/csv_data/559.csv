5581,Physician Health in the Times of COVID-19.,"Background and objectives: A virtual registry study evaluating real world evidence on physicians' use of prophylactic regimens for protection against SARS-CoV-2. This paper summarizes the interim results. Methods: Asymptomatic physicians at risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 responded to online questions at baseline and 7 weeks post-baseline. Baseline data included demographics, prophylaxis regimen (including ""no prophylaxis"") and start date. Participants who provided complete week-7 data (information on type of health facility [COVID/Non-COVID], number of presumed/confirmed cases exposed to, PPE use, SARS-CoV-2 testing and symptoms, regimen adherence and intercurrent illness) comprised the Completer population. Limited data (regimen adherence, SARS-CoV-2 testing) was collected for participants who failed to provide complete week7 data. Those providing limited/complete information comprised the Evaluable population. Results: Of 369 enrolled participants, 182 (mean age 42Â±11.05 years) comprised the Evaluable population. They showed a male preponderance (67.6%). Practitioners from Maharashtra (59.9%) and specialties of Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Anesthesiology and Critical Care (63.2%) accounted for the majority. ICMR's HCQ prophylaxis regimen was initiated by 125 (68.7%) participants with 31 (17%) initiating 'No prophylaxis'. The highest adherence was for the ICMRregimen (87.2%). In the Completer population comprising 150 participants, 87 were exposed to presumed (81) and/or confirmed cases (60). Most exposures to confirmed cases (49, 81.7%) were high-risk. PPE use was generally high (75-100%). Most participants (94.7%) did not report an AE. The proportions with an AE was similar with ICMR regimen (5.9%) and no prophylaxis (6.5%). Interpretation and conclusions: Physicians in India preferred ICMR's HCQ regimen. The regimen appears to be safe and associated with a high level of adherence."
5582,"Robust Testing in Outpatient Settings to Explore COVID-19 Epidemiology: Disparities in Race/Ethnicity and Age, Salt Lake County, Utah, 2020.","Objective: US-based descriptions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have focused on patients with severe disease. Our objective was to describe characteristics of a predominantly outpatient population tested for SARS-CoV-2 in an area receiving comprehensive testing. Methods: We extracted data on demographic characteristics and clinical data for all patients (91% outpatient) tested for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Utah Health clinics in Salt Lake County, Utah, from March 10 through April 24, 2020. We manually extracted data on symptoms and exposures from a subset of patients, and we calculated the adjusted odds of receiving a positive test result by demographic characteristics and clinical risk factors. Results: Of 17 662 people tested, 1006 (5.7%) received a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. Hispanic/Latinx people were twice as likely as non-Hispanic White people to receive a positive test result (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.1), although the severity at presentation did not explain this discrepancy. Young people aged 0-19 years had the lowest rates of receiving a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 (<4 cases per 10 000 population), and adults aged 70-79 and 40-49 had the highest rates of hospitalization per 100 000 population among people who received a positive test result (16 and 11, respectively). Conclusions: We found disparities by race/ethnicity and age in access to testing and in receiving a positive test result among outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2. Further research and public health outreach on addressing racial/ethnic and age disparities will be needed to effectively combat the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the United States."
5583,The Role of Trauma in Mothers' COVID-19 Vaccine Beliefs and Intentions.,"Objective: Research on COVID-19 vaccine beliefs has focused primarily on adults' intentions to vaccinate themselves; however, many parents will also face decisions about vaccinating their children. In this study, we examine how maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma history relate to mothers' beliefs and intentions about the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children. Methods: A total of 240 mothers with a mental health history participating in a parenting study answered online survey questions via Prolific. Questions assessed: (a) trauma indictors (past diagnosis, current symptoms, and lifetime exposure to events); (b) vaccine measures (intentions for self and child, COVID-19 vaccine confidence, general vaccine perceived safety, reasoning about vaccine intentions, sources of influence on intentions); and (c) possible explanatory variables (institutional distrust, negative worldviews). ANCOVAs and regression analyses were used. Results: When compared with mothers with other mental health diagnoses, mothers with a PTSD history had significantly less confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and less intent to get the vaccine for themselves or their child. These effects were explained by greater institutional distrust (i.e., significant indirect effects). Mothers with a previous PTSD diagnosis also expressed different reasons for vaccine hesitancy (e.g., less belief in science) and ascribed less influence to healthcare and governmental sources in vaccine decision-making. Conclusion: Findings highlight the potential utility of a trauma-informed approach in efforts to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. For mothers with a history of PTSD, addressing institutional distrust, including towards the healthcare industry, may be an important element to consider in the content, delivery, and mode of vaccine messaging."
5584,Saliva: a diagnostic option and a transmission route for 2019-nCoV.,"Data sources This review included 13 clinical studies (observational or clinical trial) which reported results of studies of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The other 62 referenced papers were of different types (eg, reviews, WHO protocols, letter to editor etc).Study selection The study selected trials, reviews, and in-vitro research assessing the critical aspects of saliva as an easily accessible and early-stage diagnostic source, and also an entry route for 2019-nCoV. Most of the clinical studies were descriptive case series of patients who had contracted 2019-nCoV in China. These were mainly studies designed to compare saliva samples with throat swabs, with regard to the presence of 2019-nCoV RNA. Another aspect of the included studies was the susceptibility of oral tissues to 2019-nCoV due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as a receptor for the 2019-nCoV. Some review studies and clinical infection control protocols were also included to discuss the transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV from the oral cavity. Studies were not restricted to English language and they were not all full-text papers.Data extraction and synthesis A narrative synthesis of the results was conducted using distinct headings and subheadings, defined by the authors based on relevancy to the consensus about the importance of saliva with reference to 2019-nCoV.Results There was an inherent heterogeneity among the included clinical studies concerning their designs, sampling techniques, and the results about the diagnostic value of saliva. The percentage of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients with positive 2019-nCoV RNA varied from 12.9% to 91.67% among these studies. Regarding the possibility of direct virus invasion into the oral tissues, the results suggested that ACE2+ cells in salivary glands could possibly be the target cells of 2019-nCoV and theoretically could generate infectious saliva in a sustained way. Furin was suggested as another protein which makes the tongue more vulnerable to 2019-nCoV, especially in conditions inducing its upregulation (for example, squamous cell carcinoma). According to the comparisons between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, saliva could be considered of diagnostic value via the early detection of viral RNA for both of the viruses. Whilst the viral peak was shown to be at onset of symptoms for 2019-nCoV, it can linger up to the tenth day after the appearance of symptoms for SARS-CoV. Finally, this paper warns about airborne transmission, particularly for close contacts.Conclusions Saliva can be proposed as an easily accessible diagnostic source although further clinical studies are required. Given the presence of viral RNA in saliva in the early stages of COVID-19, the recommendations to wear masks to prevent the rapid transmission of infectious droplets into the air, and keep a safe distance from other people are clearly based in evidence."

5586,Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in Palestine: a cross-sectional online study.,"Introduction: In Palestine (West Bank and Gaza), there have been more than 320 890 known cases of COVID-19, resulting in 3452 deaths. The detrimental effects of the virus can be seen in the nation's health, economy and government operations, leading to radical uncertainty that is exacerbated by the absence of any definitive treatment or vaccines. The level of knowledge about and trust in treatment and vaccination varies worldwide. This study aims to assess the willingness of Palestinians to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and their knowledge about such vaccines. Methods: An online survey of adults over 18 years old (n=1080) was conducted in Palestine in October 2020. Using multivariate logistic regression, we identified correlates of participants' willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Results: We found that about 63% of participants were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. However, acceptance varied with the specific demographic variables that were investigated. Women, married participants and those aged 18-24 years are more likely to take the vaccine. Further, participants with good knowledge about the vaccine and its side effects are more willing to get the vaccine. Conclusion: The availability of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine in Palestine is crucial to decrease the burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In addition, to ensure a high vaccination rate, health awareness campaigns should target those who are not willing to get the vaccine, especially those who are more vulnerable and the elderly."

5588,The Role of Antibody Testing for SARS-CoV-2: Is There One?,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) brought with it rapid development of both molecular and serologic assays for identification of COVID-19 infections. While Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) is required for clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, submission for EUA is currently a voluntary process for manufacturers of serologic assays. The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen, and the acceptable specimen types. An added complication is the lack of a clear understanding for how such assays should be utilized and what the reported results ultimately indicate or, perhaps more importantly, what they do not indicate. Here, we provide a brief summary of the performance of a number of serologic assays reported in the literature, comment on what we do and do not know regarding our immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and provide a number of scenarios for which serologic testing will play a role during our global response to this pandemic."
