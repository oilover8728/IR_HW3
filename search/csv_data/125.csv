1240,Is a single COVID-19 vaccine dose enough in convalescents ?,"SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 122 million persons worldwide. Most currently licensed COVID-19 vaccines require a two-dose course and many health systems are on a shortage of doses. The requirement for boosting the response after priming with the first dose is uncertain in convalescents already primed by the natural infection. Mounting evidences suggest that, after a single vaccine dose, convalescents develop antibody (total and neutralizing) levels similar to the ones measured in na√Øve vaccinees after the full two-dose course. While concerns remain on the equivalent duration of such response, optimizing vaccine delivery to convalescents seems effective and could accelerate achievement of herd immunity."
1241,"Testing for COVID-19 in dental offices: Mechanism of action, application, and interpretation of laboratory and point-of-care screening tests.","Background: The dental office potentially possesses all transmission risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Anticipating the future widespread use of COVID-19 testing in dental offices, the authors wrote this article as a proactive effort to provide dental health care providers with current and necessary information surrounding the topic. Methods: The authors consulted all relevant and current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as online resources and review articles. Results: Routine COVID-19 screening and triage protocols are unable to detect all infected people. With the advancements in diagnostic tools and techniques, COVID-19 testing at home or in the dental office may provide dentists with the ability to evaluate the disease status of their patients. At-home or point-of-care (POC) tests, providing results within minutes of being administered, would allow for appropriate measures and rapid decisions about dental patients' care process. In this review, the authors provide information about available laboratory and POC COVID-19 screening methods and identify and elaborate on the options available for use by dentists as well as the regulatory requirements of test administration. Conclusions: Dentists need to be familiar with COVID-19 POC testing options. In addition to contributing to public health, such tests may deliver rapid, accurate, and actionable results to clinical and infection control teams to enhance the safe patient flow in dental practices. Practical implications: Oral health care must continue to offer safety in this or any future pandemics. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at the POC offers a control mechanism contributing to and enhancing the real and perceived safety of care in the dental office setting."
1242,Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants: impact on vaccine efficacy and neutralizing antibodies.,"The genetic variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been emerging and circulating in different parts of the world from the beginning of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Variants are divided into three classes: variant of interest, variant of concern, and variant of high consequence depending on its impact on the transmission, disease severity, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. The variants of concern include the United Kingdom variant (B.1.1.7), South Africa variant (B.1.351), two related California variants (B.1.427 and B.1.429), and Brazil variant (P.1). These SARS-CoV-2 variants have a direct impact on the available COVID-19 vaccines and immunotherapeutics as they can alter the neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies and monoclonal antibodies resulting in mild-to-substantial loss of efficacy. There is a need to establish surveillance systems that can monitor the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants worldwide."
1243,"Multiple Variants of SARS-CoV-2 in a University Outbreak After Spring Break - Chicago, Illinois, March-May 2021.","To prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, colleges and universities have implemented multiple strategies including testing, isolation, quarantine, contact tracing, masking, and vaccination. In April 2021, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) was notified of a large cluster of students with COVID-19 at an urban university after spring break. A total of 158 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed among undergraduate students during March 15-May 3, 2021; the majority (114; 72.2%) lived in on-campus dormitories. CDPH evaluated the role of travel and social connections, as well as the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants, on transmission. Among 140 infected students who were interviewed, 89 (63.6%) reported recent travel outside Chicago during spring break, and 57 (40.7%) reported indoor social exposures. At the time of the outbreak, undergraduate-aged persons were largely ineligible for vaccination in Chicago; only three of the students with COVID-19 (1.9%) were fully vaccinated. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 104 specimens revealed multiple distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting several nearly simultaneous introductions. Most specimens (66; 63.5%) were B.1.1.222, a lineage not widely detected in Chicago before or after this outbreak. These results demonstrate the potential for COVID-19 outbreaks on university campuses after widespread student travel during breaks, at the beginning of new school terms, and when students participate in indoor social gatherings. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, colleges and universities should encourage COVID-19 vaccination; discourage unvaccinated students from travel, including during university breaks; implement serial COVID-19 screening among unvaccinated persons after university breaks; encourage masking; and implement universal serial testing for students based on community transmission levels."
1244,Interpretative immune targets and contemporary position for vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2: A systematic review.,"The year 2020 started with the emergence of novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19 infection. Soon after the first evidence was reported in Wuhan, China, the World Health Organization declared global public health emergency and imminent need to understand the pathogenicity of the virus was required in limited time. Once the genome sequence of the virus was delineated, scientists across the world started working on the development of vaccines. Although, some laboratories have been using previously developed vaccine platforms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and apply them in COVID-19 vaccines due to genetic similarities between coronaviruses. We have conducted a literature review to assess the background and current status of COVID-19 vaccines. The worldwide implementation and strategies for COVID-19 vaccine development are summarized from studies reported in years 2015-2020. While discussing the vaccine candidates, we have also explained interpretative immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are several vaccine candidates at preclinical and clinical stages; however, only 42 vaccines are under clinical trials. Therefore, more industry collaborations and financial supports to COVID-19 studies are needed for mass-scale vaccine development. To develop effective vaccine platforms against SARS-CoV-2, the genetic resemblance with other coronaviruses are being evaluated which may further promote fast-track trials on previously developed SARS-CoV vaccines."
1245,Implementation of an open-source robotic platform for SARS-CoV-2 testing by real-time RT-PCR.,"The current global pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 has pushed the limits of global health systems across all aspects of clinical care, including laboratory diagnostics. Supply chain disruptions and rapidly-shifting markets have resulted in flash-scarcity of commercial laboratory reagents; this has motivated health care providers to search for alternative workflows to cope with the international increase in demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The aim of this study is to present a reproducible workflow for real time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing using OT-2 open-source liquid-handling robots (Opentrons, NY). We have developed a framework that includes a code template which is helpful for building different stand-alone robotic stations, capable of performing specific protocols. Such stations can be combined together to create a complex multi-stage workflow, from sample setup to real time RT-PCR. Using our open-source code, it is easy to create new stations or workflows from scratch, adapt existing templates to update the experimental protocols, or to fine-tune the code to fit specific needs. Using this framework, we developed the code for two different workflows and evaluated them using external quality assessment (EQA) samples from the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN). The affordability of this platform makes automated SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing accessible for most laboratories and hospitals with qualified bioinformatics personnel. This platform also allows for flexibility, as it is not dependent on any specific commercial kit, and thus it can be quickly adapted to protocol changes, reagent, consumable shortages, or any other temporary material constraints."
1246,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination for patients with solid cancer: Review and point of view of a French oncology intergroup (GCO, TNCD, UNICANCER).","The impacts of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on cancer care are multiple, entailing a high risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with cancer treated by chemotherapy. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines represent an opportunity to decrease the rate of severe COVID-19 cases in patients with cancer and also to restore normal cancer care. Patients with cancer to be targeted for vaccination are difficult to define owing to the limited contribution of these patients in the phase III trials testing the different vaccines. It seems appropriate to vaccinate not only patients with cancer with ongoing treatment or with a treatment having been completed less than 3 years ago but also household and close contacts. High-risk patients with cancer who are candidates for priority access to vaccination are those treated by chemotherapy. The very high-priority population includes patients with curative treatment and palliative first- or second-line chemotherapy, as well as patients requiring surgery or radiotherapy involving a large volume of lung, lymph node and/or haematopoietic tissue. When possible, vaccination should be carried out before cancer treatment begins. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can be performed during chemotherapy while avoiding periods of neutropenia and lymphopenia. For organisational reasons, vaccination should be performed in cancer care centres with messenger RNA vaccines (or non-replicating adenoviral vaccines in non-immunocompromised patients). Considering the current state of knowledge, the benefit-risk ratio strongly favours SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of all patients with cancer. To obtain more data concerning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, it is necessary to implement cohorts of vaccinated patients with cancer."
1247,[COVID-19: epidemiology and mutations : An update].,"Mutations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can enhance the spread and the infectiousness and decrease the protective effect of antibodies present after infection, vaccination or antibody treatment. The alpha variant (B.1.1.7), first seen in Kent/United Kingdom, has increased the R‚Äëvalue and therefore the infectiousness by 75%; however, the effectiveness of the vaccines against SARS-CoV‚Äë2 available in Germany seems to be only slightly impaired by these mutations. In the case of the beta variant (B.1.351), first described in South Africa, the neutralization ability of antibodies towards SARS-CoV‚Äë2 is decreased. The monoclonal antibodies bamlanivimab and etesivimab, which are used therapeutically, are ineffective. The AstraZeneca vaccine offers almost no protection against mild or moderate disease caused by the beta variant. The gamma variant (P.1 or B.1.1.28.1), which was first found in Brazil, is probably 1.7-2.6 times more transmissible than previous virus strains circulating in Brazil. In addition to the infectiousness, the mortality risk of the gamma variant also seems to be increased between 1.2 and 1.9-fold in adults and between 5 and 8-fold in young persons. The delta variant (B.1.617), first described in India, is now dominant in most countries. It is 50% more infectious than the alpha variant, and the protective effect of vaccinations against symptomatic disease can be decreased (Biontech: delta variant 88%, alpha variant 93.7%; AstraZeneca: delta variant 67%, alpha variant 74.5%). Furthermore, the course of the disease with the delta variant is often more severe than with the wild type. Disease courses with the delta variant are less severe in vaccinated than in nonvaccinated persons, and fatal outcomes are substantially rarer. A high vaccination rate is essential in order to approach herd immunity and to bring the pandemic under control. Even where the protective effect towards mild or moderate disease is decreased, as a rule, vaccination still offers excellent protection against life-threatening and fatal disease courses."

1249,"mRNA vaccines for COVID-19: what, why and how.","The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2), has impacted human lives in the most profound ways with millions of infections and deaths. Scientists and pharmaceutical companies have been in race to produce vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine generation usually demands years of developing and testing for efficacy and safety. However, it only took less than one year to generate two mRNA vaccines from their development to deployment. The rapid production time, cost-effectiveness, versatility in vaccine design, and clinically proven ability to induce cellular and humoral immune response have crowned mRNA vaccines with spotlights as most promising vaccine candidates in the fight against the pandemic. In this review, we discuss the general principles of mRNA vaccine design and working mechanisms of the vaccines, and provide an up-to-date summary of pre-clinical and clinical trials on seven anti-COVID-19 mRNA candidate vaccines, with the focus on the two mRNA vaccines already licensed for vaccination. In addition, we highlight the key strategies in designing mRNA vaccines to maximize the expression of immunogens and avoid intrinsic innate immune response. We also provide some perspective for future vaccine development against COVID-19 and other pathogens."
