330,[Possibilities and pitfalls of virus antigen and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2].,"Összefoglaló. A koronavírus-betegség 2019 (COVID-19)-pandémia komoly kihívás elé állította nemcsak a mikrobiológiai laboratóriumokat, hanem az eredmények interpretálásában a klinikumban dolgozó kollégákat is. Az orvostudomány specializált világában az immunológiai és a fertőző betegségekkel kapcsolatos ismeretek az antimikrobás terápiás megoldások sikeressége, valamint a széles körű vakcináció miatt az idők folyamán számos szakterületen háttérbe szorultak, felfrissítésük sürgető és elengedhetetlen része a pandémiával való megküzdésnek. A diagnosztikai vizsgálatok fontos eszközei a járvány megfékezésének, illetve a betegek ellátásának, azonban a vírus és az emberi szervezet interakciójának megértése elengedhetetlenül szükséges a korrekt epidemiológiai és gyógyászati véleményalkotáshoz. Jelen cikkünk az orvosi gyakorlat számára foglalja össze a súlyos akut légzőszervi szindrómát okozó koronavírus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) kimutatására, valamint az immunrendszer specifikus immunválaszának szerológiai vizsgálatára irányuló, gyakorlatban használatos módszereket, azok helyét, szerepét és értékelésük szempontjait a tudomány jelen állása szerint. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(15): 563-570. Summary. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed a serious challenge not only for microbiology laboratories, but also for the clinicians in interpretation of the results. In the specialized world of medicine, knowledge of immunological and infectious diseases has been relegated to the background in many disciplines over time due to the success of antimicrobial therapies and widespread vaccination, so updating them is an urgent and essential part of the fight against the pandemic. Diagnostic tests are important tools for controlling the epidemic and caring for patients, but understanding the interaction between the virus and the human body is essential to form a correct epidemiological and medical opinion. This paper summarizes the medical methods for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the serological testing of the specific immune response of the immune system, their place, role and criteria of their evaluation according to current scientific knowledge.

332,REVEALR: A Multicomponent XNAzyme-Based Nucleic Acid Detection System for SARS-CoV-2.,"Isothermal amplification strategies capable of rapid, inexpensive, and accurate nucleic acid detection provide new options for large-scale pathogen detection, disease diagnosis, and genotyping. Here we report a highly sensitive multicomponent XNA-based nucleic acid detection platform that combines analyte preamplification with X10-23-mediated catalysis to detect the viral pathogen responsible for COVID-19. The platform, termed RNA-Encoded Viral Nucleic Acid Analyte Reporter (REVEALR), functions with a detection limit of ≤20 aM (∼10 copies/μL) using conventional fluorescence and paper-based lateral flow readout modalities. With a total assay time of 1 h, REVEALR provides a convenient nucleic acid alternative to equivalent CRISPR-based approaches, which have become popular methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The assay shows no cross-reactivity for other in vitro transcribed respiratory viral RNAs and functions with perfect accuracy against COVID-19 patient-derived clinical samples."
333,The importance of genomic analysis in cracking the coronavirus pandemic.,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has pushed the scientific community to undertake intense research efforts. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 biology is necessary to discover therapeutic or preventive strategies capable of containing the pandemic. Knowledge of the structural characteristics of the virus genome and proteins is essential to find targets for therapies and immunological interventions.Areas covered: This review covers different areas of expertise, genomic analysis of circulating strains, structural biology, viral mutations, molecular diagnostics, disease, and vaccines. In particular, the review is focused on the molecular approaches and modern clinical strategies used in these fields.Expert opinion: Molecular approaches to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have been critical to shorten time for new diagnostic, therapeutic and prevention strategies. In this perspective, the entire scientific community is moving in the same direction. Vaccines, together with the development of new drugs to treat the disease, represent the most important strategy to protect human from viral disease and prevent further spread. In this regard, new molecular technologies have been successfully implemented. The use of a novel strategy of communication is suggested for a better diffusion to the broader public of new data and results."

335,Stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Nonsupplemented Saliva.,"The expense of saliva collection devices designed to stabilize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA is prohibitive to mass testing. However, virus RNA in nonsupplemented saliva is stable for extended periods and at elevated temperatures. Simple plastic tubes for saliva collection will make large-scale testing and continued surveillance easier."

337,Analytical and clinical evaluation of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 serological immunoassays in hospitalized patients and ambulatory individuals.,"Background: This study aimed to compare four anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in populations presenting different clinical severity levels. Methods: Three populations were included: ""severe-to-critical"" ICU-hospitalized patients (n = 18), ""mild-to-moderate"" hospitalized patients (n = 16) and non-hospitalized symptomatic patients (n = 24). Four commercial immunoassays were analyzed and validated: anti-IgG ARCHITECT® (Abbott), anti-Total antibodies (Ab) VITROS® (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics), anti-IgG NovaLisa® (NovaTec Immundiagnostica) and Healgen® IgM and IgG (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech). Sensitivities were evaluated according to days post-symptoms onset (pso). Specificities were evaluated on SARS-CoV-2-negative control sera collected before January 2020. Results: A majority of severe-to-critically ill patients showed detectable Ab already at day 14 and sensitivities reached 100 % after 22 days pso. For patients with ""mild-to-moderate"" illness, sensitivities increased by at least 5-fold from day 0 to day 14 pso. Non-hospitalized symptomatic individuals already seroconverted at day 14 days pso with 100 % sensitivities for Total Ab VITROS®. Specificities were evaluated at 97 % for ARCHITECT® and NovaLisa®, 98 % for VITROS® and at 94 % for Healgen® combined IgM and IgG. Five ""severe-to-critically"" ill patients presented high positive Ab levels for at least 16 weeks pso. Conclusion: The Ab levels and the evaluated sensitivities, representing the true positive rate, increased overtime and were related to the COVID-19 severity. Automated Total Ab immunoassay showed better sensitivities and specificity for immunological surveillance and vaccine evaluation."
338,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Qualitative Immunoglobulin G Assays: The Value of Numeric Reporting.,"Context.—: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing is used for serosurveillance and will be important to evaluate vaccination status. Given the urgency to release coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology tests, most manufacturers have developed qualitative tests. Objective.—: To evaluate clinical performance of 6 different SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and their quantitative results to better elucidate the clinical role of serology testing in COVID-19. Design.—: Six SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays were tested using remnant specimens from 190 patients. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for each assay with the current manufacturer's cutoff and a lower cutoff. A numeric result analysis and discrepancy analysis were performed. Results.—: Specificity was higher than 93% for all assays, and sensitivity was higher than 80% for all assays (≥7 days post-polymerase chain reaction testing). Inpatients with more severe disease had higher numeric values compared with health care workers with mild or moderate disease. Several discrepant serology results were those just below the manufacturers' cutoff. Conclusions.—: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 IgG antibody testing can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially with negative polymerase chain reaction. Quantitative COVID-19 IgG results are important to better understand the immunologic response and disease course of this novel virus and to assess immunity as part of future vaccination programs."
