9200,Combination of a Sindbis-SARS-CoV-2 Spike Vaccine and alphaOX40 Antibody Elicits Protective Immunity Against SARS-CoV-2 Induced Disease and Potentiates Long-Term SARS-CoV-2-Specific Humoral and T-Cell Immunity.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major global public threat. Currently, a worldwide effort has been mounted to generate billions of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses to immunize the world's population at record speeds. However, there is still a demand for alternative effective vaccines that rapidly confer long-term protection and rely upon cost-effective, easily scaled-up manufacturing. Here, we present a Sindbis alphavirus vector (SV), transiently expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SV.Spike), combined with the OX40 immunostimulatory antibody (αOX40) as a novel, highly effective vaccine approach. We show that SV.Spike plus αOX40 elicits long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and a vigorous T-cell response in mice. Protein binding, immunohistochemical, and cellular infection assays all show that vaccinated mice sera inhibits spike functions. Immunophenotyping, RNA Seq transcriptome profiles, and metabolic analysis indicate a reprogramming of T cells in vaccinated mice. Activated T cells were found to mobilize to lung tissue. Most importantly, SV.Spike plus αOX40 provided robust immune protection against infection with authentic coronavirus in transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2-Tg). Finally, our immunization strategy induced strong effector memory response, potentiating protective immunity against re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results show the potential of a new Sindbis virus-based vaccine platform to counteract waning immune response, which can be used as a new candidate to combat SARS-CoV-2. Given the T-cell responses elicited, our vaccine is likely to be effective against variants that are proving challenging, as well as serve as a platform to develop a broader spectrum pancoronavirus vaccine. Similarly, the vaccine approach is likely to be applicable to other pathogens."
9201,Promising role for mesenchymal stromal cells in coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19)-related severe acute respiratory syndrome?,Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have immune regulatory and tissue regenerative properties. MSCs are being studied as a therapy option for many inflammatory and immune disorders and are approved to treat acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and associated coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) has claimed many lives. Innovative therapies are needed. Preliminary data using MSCs in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 are emerging. We review mechanisms of action of MSCs in inflammatory and immune conditions and discuss a potential role in persons with COVID-19.
9202,Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and anorexia, are frequently observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the pathophysiological mechanisms connecting these GI symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain elusive. Previous studies indicate that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into intestinal cells leads to downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors resulting in impaired barrier function. While intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the amino acid transporter B0AT1, the B0AT1/ACE2 complex within the intestinal epithelium acts as a regulator of gut microbiota composition and function. Alternations to the B0AT1/ACE2 complex lead to microbial dysbiosis through increased local and systemic immune responses. Previous studies have also suggested that altered serotonin metabolism may be the underlying cause of GI disorders involving diarrhea. The findings of elevated plasma serotonin levels and high fecal calprotectin in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea indicate that the viral infection evokes a systemic inflammatory response that specifically involves the GI. Interestingly, the elevated proinflammatory cytokines correlate with elevated serotonin and fecal calprotectin levels further supporting the evidence of GI inflammation, a hallmark of functional GI disorders. Moreover, the finding that rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients remain positive for SARS-CoV-2 even after the nasopharynx clears the virus, suggests that viral replication and shedding from the GI tract may be more robust than that of the respiratory tract, further indicating fecal-oral transmission as another important route of viral spread. This review summarized the evidence for pathophysiological mechanisms (impaired barrier function, gut inflammation, altered serotonin metabolism and gut microbiota dysbiosis) underlying the GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19."
9203,Contamination of SARS-CoV-2 in patient surroundings and on personal protective equipment in a non-ICU isolation ward for COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positive status.,"Objectives: We performed an environmental sampling study to investigate the environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 by COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positive status of clinical samples. Methods: We sampled the air from rooms for nine COVID-19 patients with illness or positive PCR > 30 days, before and after nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabbing and before and after nebulization treatment. We also sampled patients' surroundings and healthcare workers' personal protection equipment (PPE) in a non-ICU ward. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR. Results: Eighty-eight samples were collected from high-touch surfaces and floors in patient rooms and toilets, with only the bedsheets of two patients and one toilet positive for SARS-CoV-2. All air samples (n = 34) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Fifty-five samples collected from PPE were all negative. Conclusion: Contamination of near-patient surroundings was uncommon for COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positive status if environmental cleaning/disinfection were performed rigorously. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely in these non-ICU settings."
9204,DockCoV2: a drug database against SARS-CoV-2.,"The current state of the COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis. To fight the novel coronavirus, one of the best-known ways is to block enzymes essential for virus replication. Currently, we know that the SARS-CoV-2 virus encodes about 29 proteins such as spike protein, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Papain-like protease (PLpro), and nucleocapsid (N) protein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry and transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2) for spike protein priming. Thus in order to speed up the discovery of potential drugs, we develop DockCoV2, a drug database for SARS-CoV-2. DockCoV2 focuses on predicting the binding affinity of FDA-approved and Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) drugs with the seven proteins mentioned above. This database contains a total of 3,109 drugs. DockCoV2 is easy to use and search against, is well cross-linked to external databases, and provides the state-of-the-art prediction results in one site. Users can download their drug-protein docking data of interest and examine additional drug-related information on DockCoV2. Furthermore, DockCoV2 provides experimental information to help users understand which drugs have already been reported to be effective against MERS or SARS-CoV. DockCoV2 is available at https://covirus.cc/drugs/."
9205,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 Symptoms and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibody Positivity in a Large Survey of First Responders and Healthcare Personnel, May-July 2020.","A severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serosurvey among first responder/healthcare personnel showed that loss of taste/smell was most predictive of seropositivity; percent seropositivity increased with number of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms. However, 22.9% with 9 symptoms were seronegative, and 8.3% with no symptoms were seropositive. These findings demonstrate limitations of symptom-based surveillance and importance of testing."
9206,Structural insights into SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its natural mutants found in Mexican population.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerged coronavirus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); it become a pandemic since March 2020. To date, there have been described three lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating worldwide, two of them are found among Mexican population, within these, we observed three mutations of spike (S) protein located at amino acids H49Y, D614G, and T573I. To understand if these mutations could affect the structural behavior of S protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the binding with S protein inhibitors (cepharanthine, nelfinavir, and hydroxychloroquine), molecular dynamic simulations and molecular docking were employed. It was found that these punctual mutations affect considerably the structural behavior of the S protein compared to wild type, which also affect the binding of its inhibitors into their respective binding site. Thus, further experimental studies are needed to explore if these affectations have an impact on drug-S protein binding and its possible clinical effect."

9208,Late phase of COVID-19 pandemic in General Cardiology. A position paper of the ESC Council for Cardiology Practice.,"Cardiovascular (CV) engagement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a huge determinant of prognosis during the acute phase of the disease. However, little is known about the potential chronic implications of the late phase of COVID-19 and about the appropriate approach to these patients. Heart failure, type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, myocarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, and thrombosis have been shown to be related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and a 'long COVID-19' illness has been recognized with fatigue, chest pain, and dyspnoea among the most frequent symptoms reported after discharge from hospital. This paper focuses on some open questions that cardiologists are going to face during the next months in a general cardiology outpatient clinic, in particular how to evaluate a 'post-COVID' patient during follow-up of CV complications of the acute phase and how to manage new CV symptoms that could be the consequence, at least in part, of heart/vessels and/or lung involvement of the previous virus infection. Present symptoms and signs, history of previous CV disease (both preceding COVID-19 and occurring during viral infection), and specific laboratory and imaging measurements during the acute phase may be of interest in focusing on how to approach the clinical evaluation of a post-COVID patient and how to integrate in our standard of care the new information on COVID-19, possibly in a multidisciplinary view. Dealing with the increased COVID-associated CV risk burden and becoming acquainted with potential new e-cardiology approaches aimed at integrating the cardiology practice are relevant new challenges brought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and its sequelae."
9209,Tissue factor upregulation is associated with SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.,"Background: A substantial proportion of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop severe/critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with thrombosis. Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2--induced upregulation of tissue factor (TF) expression may be responsible for thrombus formation in COVID-19. Methods: We compared autopsy lung tissues from 11 patients with COVID-19--associated ARDS with samples from 6 patients with ARDS from other causes (non-COVID-19 ARDS) and 11 normal control lungs. Results: Dual RNA in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2 and TF identified sporadic clustered SARS-CoV-2 with prominent co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 and TF RNA. TF expression was 2-fold higher in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 ARDS lungs (P = .017) and correlated with the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 staining (R2 = .36, P = .04). By immunofluorescence, TF protein expression was 2.1-fold higher in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 ARDS lungs (P = .0048) and 11-fold (P < .001) higher than control lungs. Fibrin thrombi and thrombi positive for platelet factor 4 (PF4) were found in close proximity to regions expressing TF in COVID-19 ARDS lung, and correlated with TF expression (fibrin, R2 = .52, P < .001; PF4, R2 = .59, P < .001). Conclusions: These data suggest that upregulation of TF expression is associated with thrombus formation in COVID-19 lungs and could be a key therapeutic target. Correlation of TF expression with SARS-CoV-2 in lungs of COVID-19 patients also raises the possibility of direct TF induction by the virus."
