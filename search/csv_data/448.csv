4470,Epidemiology and precision of SARS-CoV-2 detection following lockdown and relaxation measures.,"Objectives: Detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is key to the clinical and epidemiological assessment of CoVID-19. We cross-validated manual and automated high-throughput testing for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, evaluated SARS-CoV-2 loads in nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS), lower respiratory fluids, and plasma, and analyzed detection rates after lockdown and relaxation measures. Methods: Basel-S-gene, Roche-E-gene, and Roche-cobas®6800-Target1 and Target2 were prospectively validated in 1344 NOPS submitted during the first pandemic peak (Week 13). Follow-up cohort (FUP) 1, 2, and 3 comprised 10,999, 10,147, and 19,389 NOPS submitted during a 10-week period until Weeks 23, 33, and 43, respectively. Results: Concordant results were obtained in 1308 cases (97%), including 97 (9%) SARS-CoV-2-positives showing high quantitative correlations (Spearman's r > .95; p < .001) for all assays and high precision by Bland-Altman analysis. Discordant samples (N = 36, 3%) had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 loads (p < .001). Following lockdown, detection rates declined to <1% in FUP-1, reducing single-test positive predictive values from 99.3% to 85.1%. Following relaxation, rates flared up to 4% and 12% in FUP-2 and -3, but infected patients were younger than during lockdown (34 vs. 52 years, p < .001). In 261 patients providing 936 NOPS, SARS-CoV-2 loads declined by three orders of magnitude within 10 days postdiagnosis (p < .001). SARS-CoV-2 loads in NOPS correlated with those in time-matched lower respiratory fluids or in plasma but remained detectable in some cases with negative follow-up NOPS, respectively. Conclusion: Manual and automated assays significantly correlated qualitatively and quantitatively. Following a successful lockdown, declining positive predictive values require independent dual-target confirmation for reliable assessment. Confirmatory and quantitative follow-up testing should be obtained within <5 days and consider lower respiratory fluids in symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative NOPS."
4471,Parent-Collected Nasal Swab for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Testing in Children.,"This cross-sectional study, including children hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, demonstrates for the first time that nonhealthcare worker parents perform similarly to healthcare workers in the administration to their children of an unsupervised nasal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 detection by following written instructions and video tutorials."
4472,Epidemiological profiles and associated risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients based on a high-throughput testing facility in India.,"We describe the epidemiological characteristics and associated risk factors of those presenting at a large testing centre for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is a retrospective record review of individuals who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a high-throughput national-level government facility located in the north of India. Samples collected from 6 April to 31 December 2020 are included in this work and represent four highly populous regions. Additionally, there was a prospective follow-up of 1729 cases through telephone interviews from 25 May 2020 to 20 June 2020. Descriptive analysis has been performed for profiling clinic-epidemiological aspects of suspect cases. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and symptom status. A total of 125 600 participants' details have been included in this report. The mean (s.d.) age of the participants was 33.1 (±15.3) years and 66% were male. Among these tested, 9515 (7.6%) were positive for COVID-19. A large proportion of positive cases were asymptomatic. In symptomatic positive cases, the commonest symptoms were cough and fever. Increasing age (groups 20-59 and ≥60 years compared to age group less than 5 years), male sex, history of international travel, symptoms for SARS-CoV-2, and participants from Delhi and Madhya Pradesh were positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Having co-morbidity, risk behaviours and intra-familial positivity were associated with a positive odds ratio for exhibiting SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Intensified testing and isolation of cases, identification of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals and additional care of those with co-morbidities and risk behaviours will all be collectively important for disease containment in India. Reasons for differentials in testing between men and women remain an important area for in-depth study. The increased deployment of vaccines is likely to impact the trajectory of COVID-19 in the coming time, and therefore our data will serve as a comparative resource as India experiences the second wave of infection in light of newer variants that are likely to accelerate disease spread."

4474,Effect of Polymer Hydrophilicity and Molar Mass on the Properties of the Protein in Protein-Polymer Conjugates: The Case of PPEylated Myoglobin.,"Polyphosphoesters (PPEs), a versatile class of biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, have been proposed as alternatives to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which is suspected to be responsible for anaphylactic reactions in some patients after the administration of PEGylated compounds, e.g., in the current Covid-19 vaccines. We present the synthesis and characterization of a novel set of protein-polymer conjugates using the model protein myoglobin and a set of PPEs with different hydrophilicity and molar mass. We report an extensive evaluation of the (bio)physical properties of the protein within the conjugates, studying its conformation, residual activity, and thermal stability by complementary techniques (UV-vis spectroscopy, nano-differential scanning calorimetry, and fluorometry). The data underline the systematic influence of polymer hydrophilicity on protein properties. The more hydrophobic polymers destabilize the protein, the more hydrophilic PPEs protect against thermally induced aggregation and proteolytic degradation. This basic study aims at guiding the design of future PPEylated drugs and protein conjugates."
4475,Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 cell culture replication in respiratory samples from patients with severe COVID-19.,"Objectives: This study compares the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples from patients with mild COVID-19 with those from hospitalized patients with severe bilateral pneumonia. In severe COVID-19, we also analysed the presence of neutralizing activity in paired sera. Methods: We performed cell cultures on 193 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction respiratory samples, positive for SARS-CoV-2, obtained from 189 patients at various times, from clinical diagnosis to follow-up. Eleven samples were obtained from asymptomatic individuals, 91 samples from 91 outpatients with mild forms of COVID-19 and 91 samples from 87 inpatients with severe pneumonia. In these patients, neutralizing activity was analysed in 30 paired sera collected after symptom onset >10 days. Results: We detected a cytopathic effect (CPE) in 91/193 (47%) samples. Viral viability was maintained for up to 10 days in patients with mild COVID-19. In patients with severe COVID-19, the virus remained viable for up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms. Patients with severe COVID-19 presented infectious virus at a significantly higher rate in the samples with moderate to low viral load (cycle threshold value ≥ 26): 32/75 (43%) versus 14/63 (22%) for mild cases (p < 0.01). We observed a positive CPE despite the presence of clear neutralizing activity (NT50 > 1:1024 in 10% (3/30) of samples. Discussion: Patients with severe COVID-19 might shed viable virus during prolonged periods of up to 4 weeks after symptom onset, even when presenting high cycle threshold values in their respiratory samples and despite having developed high neutralizing antibody titres."

4478,Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis to Prevent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection : A Randomized Trial.,"Background: Effective prevention against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently limited to nonpharmaceutical strategies. Laboratory and observational data suggested that hydroxychloroquine had biological activity against SARS-CoV-2, potentially permitting its use for prevention. Objective: To test hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design: Household-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04328961). Setting: National U.S. multicenter study. Participants: Close contacts recently exposed (<96 hours) to persons with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intervention: Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d for 3 days followed by 200 mg/d for 11 days) or ascorbic acid (500 mg/d followed by 250 mg/d) as a placebo-equivalent control. Measurements: Participants self-collected mid-turbinate swabs daily (days 1 to 14) for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at enrollment. Results: Between March and August 2020, 671 households were randomly assigned: 337 (407 participants) to the hydroxychloroquine group and 334 (422 participants) to the control group. Retention at day 14 was 91%, and 10 724 of 11 606 (92%) expected swabs were tested. Among the 689 (89%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline, there was no difference between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by day 14 (53 versus 45 events; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66]; P > 0.20). The frequency of participants experiencing adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than the control group (66 [16.2%] versus 46 [10.9%], respectively; P = 0.026). Limitation: The delay between exposure, and then baseline testing and the first dose of hydroxychloroquine or ascorbic acid, was a median of 2 days. Conclusion: This rigorous randomized controlled trial among persons with recent exposure excluded a clinically meaningful effect of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

4479,Evaluation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody Assays and Correlation with Neutralizing Antibodies.,"Background: As serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2 become more widely utilized, it is important to understand their performance characteristics and correlation with neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated 3 commonly used SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays (Abbott, DiaSorin, and EUROIMMUN) for clinical sensitivity, specificity, and correlation with neutralizing antibodies, and then compared antibody kinetics during the acute phase of infection. Methods: Three panels of samples were tested on every assay. Sensitivity was assessed using a panel of 35 specimens serially collected from 7 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Specificity was determined using 100 sera samples collected in 2018 from healthy individuals prior to the outbreak. Analytical specificity was determined using a panel of 37 samples from individuals with respiratory illnesses other than COVID-19. Results: Clinical sensitivity was 91.43% (95% CI 76.94-98.20%) for Abbott, and 88.57% (95% CI 73.26-96.80%) for both DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN. Clinical specificity was 99.00% (95% CI 94.55-99.97%) for Abbott and DiaSorin and 94.00% (95% CI 87.40-97.77%) for EUROIMMUN. The IgG assays demonstrated good qualitative agreement (minimum of 94%) and good correlation between the quantitative result for each combination of assays (r2 ≥ 0.90). The neutralizing antibody response did not necessarily follow the same temporal kinetics as the IgG response and did not necessarily correlate with IgG values. Conclusion: The 3 IgG antibody assays demonstrated comparable performance characteristics. Importantly, a qualitative positive IgG result obtained with any of the assays was associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies; however, neutralizing antibody concentrations did not correlate well with signal to cutoff ratios."
