8591,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors among already approved drugs.,"To discover effective drugs for COVID-19 treatment amongst already clinically approved drugs, we developed a high throughput screening assay for SARS-CoV-2 virus entry inhibitors using SARS2-S pseudotyped virus. An approved drug library of 1800 small molecular drugs was screened for SARS2 entry inhibitors and 15 active drugs were identified as specific SARS2-S pseudovirus entry inhibitors. Antiviral tests using native SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells confirmed that 7 of these drugs (clemastine, amiodarone, trimeprazine, bosutinib, toremifene, flupenthixol, and azelastine) significantly inhibited SARS2 replication, reducing supernatant viral RNA load with a promising level of activity. Three of the drugs were classified as histamine receptor antagonists with clemastine showing the strongest anti-SARS2 activity (EC50 = 0.95 ± 0.83 µM). Our work suggests that these 7 drugs could enter into further in vivo studies and clinical investigations for COVID-19 treatment."
8592,"The immune response and immune evasion characteristics in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2: Vaccine design strategies.","The worldwide outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as a novel human coronavirus, was the worrying news at the beginning of 2020. Since its emergence complicated more than 870,000 individuals and led to more than 43,000 deaths worldwide. Considering to the potential threat of a pandemic and transmission severity of it, there is an urgent need to evaluate and realize this new virus's structure and behavior and the immunopathology of this disease to find potential therapeutic protocols and to design and develop effective vaccines. This disease is able to agitate the response of the immune system in the infected patients, so ARDS, as a common consequence of immunopathological events for infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, could be the main reason for death. Here, we summarized the immune response and immune evasion characteristics in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 and therapeutic and prophylactic strategies with a focus on vaccine development and its challenges."
8593,Experience from a COVID-19 first-line referral clinic in Greater Copenhagen.,"Introduction: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure in Denmark, first-line referral centres were established to handle all patients suspected of COVID-19 or other upper respiratory tract infection. Here we report the first experiences from a first-line referral centre from Amager-Hvidovre Hospital, situated on the outskirts of Copenhagen. Methods: A retrospective quality assessment was performed with collection of symptom patterns and COVID-19 status. Results: During the first 24 days, a total of 3,551 patients were referred for assessment of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection and COVID-19. A total of 2,048 patients were assessed as having mild symptoms and referred for COVID-19 testing alone, whereas 337 patients were assessed clinically by a physician. Thirty-seven were positive for COVID-19 infection, 286 were negative. The most common symptoms reported were fever, coughing and dyspnoea. Fever was an independent predictor of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio (OR) = 2.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-5.04); p = 0.037); whereas sore throat was not (OR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.15-0.92); p = 0.045). Only a small number of patients reported loss of taste or anosmia. In total, 113 patients were admitted to hospital, the majority of patients were discharged within 24 hours with mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. Three of the COVID-19-positive patients developed a severe infection and two had a fatal outcome. Conclusions: The present study is the first to report the experiences and symptom patterns of a COVID-19 first-line referral centre with efficient triage of patients in need of hospitalisation. Funding: none. Trial registration: not relevant."

8595,Saliva in the Diagnosis of COVID-19: A Review and New Research Directions.,"This review presents literature that highlights saliva's utility as a biofluid in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. A systematic search was performed in 5 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the potential diagnostic value and/or other discriminatory properties of biological markers in the saliva of patients with COVID-19. As of July 22, 2020, a total of 28 studies have investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva. Several of those studies confirmed reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of patients with COVID-19. Saliva offered sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection comparable to that of the current standard of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. However, the utility of saliva in diagnosing COVID-19 infection remains understudied. Clinical studies with larger patient populations that measure recordings at different stages during the disease are still necessary to confirm the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis with saliva. Nevertheless, the utility of saliva as a diagnostic tool opens the possibility of using rapid and less invasive diagnostic strategies by targeting bioanalytes rather than the pathogen."
8596,Coronavirus genomes carry the signatures of their habitats.,"Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 regularly infect host tissues that express antiviral proteins (AVPs) in abundance. Understanding how they evolve to adapt or evade host immune responses is important in the effort to control the spread of infection. Two AVPs that may shape viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3). The former binds to CpG dinucleotides to facilitate the degradation of viral transcripts while the latter frequently deaminates C into U residues which could generate notable viral sequence variations. We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3 and ZAP impose selective pressures that shape the genome of an infecting coronavirus. Our investigation considered a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS infecting Homo sapiens, Bovine CoV infecting Bos taurus, MHV infecting Mus musculus, HEV infecting Sus scrofa, and CRCoV infecting Canis lupus familiaris). We show that coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues with abundant AVPs have CpG-deficient and U-rich genomes; whereas those that do not infect tissues with abundant AVPs do not share these sequence hallmarks. Among the coronaviruses surveyed herein, CpG is most deficient in SARS-CoV-2 and a temporal analysis showed a marked increase in C to U mutations over four months of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution. Furthermore, the preferred motifs in which these C to U mutations occur are the same as those subjected to APOBEC3 editing in HIV-1. These results suggest that both ZAP and APOBEC3 shape the SARS-CoV-2 genome: ZAP imposes a strong CpG avoidance, and APOBEC3 constantly edits C to U. Evolutionary pressures exerted by host immune systems onto viral genomes may motivate novel strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development."

8598,Evaluation on testing of deep throat saliva and lower respiratory tract specimens with Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay.,"Background: Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay is only validated on nasopharyngeal specimens for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Other specimen types such as deep throat saliva (DTS), also known as posterior oropharyngeal saliva and lower-respiratorytract specimens (LRT) including sputum, tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage are not validated. These non-validated specimen types, however, do have significant diagnostic value. Objective: Evaluate the performance of Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from DTS and LRT specimens. Methods: 162 specimens from 158 patients with suspected COVID-19 disease were tested with Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. These included 120 DTS and 42 LRT specimens i.e. 35 sputum, 6 tracheal aspirate and one bronchoalveolar lavage. Results were compared to those by the TIB-Molbiol LightMix® SarbecoV E-gene assay. Results: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay has satisfactory performance when compared with reference method. The positive percent agreement (PPA) of DTS and LRT specimens were 98.86 % & 100 % respectively while the negative percent agreement (NPA) was 100 % for both DTS and LRT specimens. Conclusions: This study demonstrated with appropriate sample pre-treatment, Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay can be used to test on non-validated specimen types including DTS & LRT specimens."
8599,Prediction of death status on the course of treatment in SARS-COV-2 patients with deep learning and machine learning methods.,"Background and objective: The new type of Coronavirus (2019-nCov) epidemic spread rapidly, causing more than 250 thousand deaths worldwide. The virus, which first appeared as a sign of pneumonia, was later called the SARS-COV-2 with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome by the World Health Organization. The SARS-COV-2 virus is triggered by binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2) inhibitor, which is vital in cardiovascular diseases and the immune system, especially in conditions such as cerebrovascular, hypertension, and diabetes. This study aims to evaluate the prediction performance of death status based on the demographic/clinical factors (including COVID-19 severity) by data mining methods. Methods: The dataset consists of 1603 SARS-COV-2 patients and 13 variables obtained from an open-source web address. The current dataset contains age, gender, chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, renal, cardiovascular, etc.), some enzymes (ACE, angiotensin II receptor blockers), and COVID-19 severity, which are used to predict death status using deep learning and machine learning approaches (random forest, k-nearest neighbor, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]). A grid search algorithm tunes hyperparameters of the models, and predictions are assessed through performance metrics. Steps of knowledge discovery in databases are applied to obtain the relevant information. Results: The accuracy rate of deep learning (97.15%) was more successful than the accuracy rate based on classical machine learning (92.15% for RF and 93.4% for k-NN), but the ensemble classifier XGBoost method gave the highest accuracy (99.7%). While COVID-19 severity and age calculated from XGBoost were the two most important factors associated with death status, the most determining variables for death status estimated from deep learning were COVID-19 severity and hypertension. Conclusions: The proposed model (XGBoost) achieved the best prediction of death status based on the factors as compared to the other algorithms. The results of this study can guide patients with certain variables to take early measures and access preventive health care services before they become infected with the virus."
