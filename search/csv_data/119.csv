1183,[What are the differences between the various covid-19 vaccines?].,"The coronavirus pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination appears to offer the way out of this pandemic. Vaccines against this virus make use of the SARS-CoV-2's spike protein, an essential protein on the surface of the virus that it uses to attach itself to the host cells. In viral vector vaccines (AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Johnson & Johnson) the gene for the spike protein is introduced into an adenovirus. Following vaccination, the modified adenovirus will infect cells of the host, which will subsequently start to produce the spike protein, causing an immune response. RNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) only introduce messenger RNA for the spike protein into host cells, which the messenger RNA uses to produce spike protein. Viral vector vaccines and RNA vaccines are not only faster to develop and safer to produce than traditional vaccines, they are also easier to modify to new viruses and virus variants. The latter may be of great importance for future pandemics."

1185,The initial impact of a national BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine rollout.,"Objective: This study examined the initial impact of a national BNT162b2 vaccine rollout on SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qatar. Methods: All individuals who had completed ≥14 days of follow-up by 16 March 2021 after receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine were included. This study calculated incidence rates (IR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) during days 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, and >28 days post-vaccination. Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRR) relative to the first 7-day post-vaccination period. Results: A total of 199,219 individuals with 6,521,124 person-days of follow-up were included. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 1877 (0.9%), of which 489 (26.1%) were asymptomatic and 123 (6.6%) required oxygen support. The median time from first vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 confirmation was 11.9 days (IQR 7.7-18.2). Compared with the first 7-day post-vaccination period, SARS-CoV-2 infections were lower by 65.8-84.7% during 15-21, 22-28, and >28 days (P < 0.001 for each). For severe COVID-19, the incidence rates were 75.7-93.3% lower during the corresponding time periods (P < 0.001 for each). Conclusion: The results were consistent with an early protective effect of BNT162b2 vaccine against all degrees of SARS-CoV-2 severity."
1186,Pooling Upper Respiratory Specimens for Rapid Mass Screening of COVID-19 by Real-Time RT-PCR.,"To validate the specimen-pooling strategy for real-time reverse transcription PCR detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, we generated different pools including positive specimens, reflecting the distribution of cycle threshold values at initial diagnosis. Cumulative sensitivities of tested pool sizes suggest pooling of <6 specimens for surveillance by this method."
1187,Predictors of laboratory-positive COVID-19 in children and teenagers.,"Objective: The aim of the study was to identify factors predicting laboratory-positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients with acute respiratory symptoms. Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort study. Methods: Data from 1849 individuals were analyzed. COVID-19 was confirmed (reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction) in 15.9% of patients, and factors predicting a positive test result were evaluated through prevalence odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Increasing age, personal history of obesity, and household contact with a case were found to be associated, in the multiple regression model, with increased odds of a positive test result. Young patients residing in areas with higher population sizes, as well as those with severe respiratory symptoms, were less likely to be laboratory confirmed. Conclusions: Early identification and isolation of children and teenagers with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 is important to limit viral spread. We identified several factors predicting the laboratory test result. Our findings are relevant from a public health policy perspective, particularly after the restart of in-person academic activities."

1189,The Next Set of COVID-19 Vaccines: Leveraging New Development Platforms to Increase Access for More People Around the World.,"The approval of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccines brought much optimism to efforts to end the pandemic. A recombinant adenovirus vaccine recently received emergency use authorization, and several other vaccines are likely to follow. These vaccines all use relatively new vaccine production platforms to produce the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Spike protein. This review discusses how these platforms work, what advantages they offer, and the gaps that remain in public health efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic.
