9900,"Seroprevalence and immunity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents in schools in Switzerland: design for a longitudinal, school-based prospective cohort study.","Objectives: This longitudinal cohort study aims to assess the extent and patterns of seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in school-attending children, and their parents and school personnel. It will examine risk factors for infection, the relationship between seropositivity and symptoms, and temporal persistence of antibodies. Methods: The study (Ciao Corona) will enroll a regionally representative, random sample of schools in the canton of Zurich, where 18% of the Swiss population live. Children aged 5-16 years, attending primary and secondary schools, and their parents and school personnel are invited. Venous blood and saliva samples are collected for serological testing in June/July 2020, in October/November 2020, and in March/April 2021. Bi-monthly questionnaires will cover SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and tests, health, preventive behavior, and lifestyle information. Hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models will account for sensitivity and specificity of the serological tests in the analyses and complex sampling structure, i.e., clustering within classes and schools. Results and conclusions: This unique school-based study will allow describing temporal trends of immunity, evaluate effects of preventive measures and will inform goal-oriented policy decisions during subsequent outbreaks.

9901,Cellular and Molecular Immunology Approaches for the Development of Immunotherapies against the New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): Challenges to Near-Future Breakthroughs.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), termed COVID-19, has been highlighted as the most important infectious disease of our time, without a vaccine and treatment available until this moment, with a big impact on health systems worldwide, and with high mortality rates associated with respiratory viral disease. The medical and scientific communities have also been confronted by an urgent need to better understand the mechanism of host-virus interaction aimed at developing therapies and vaccines. Since this viral disease can trigger a strong innate immune response, causing severe damage to the pulmonary tract, immunotherapies have also been explored as a means to verify the immunomodulatory effect and improve clinical outcomes, whilst the comprehensive COVID-19 immunology still remains under investigation. In this review, both cellular and molecular immunopathology as well as hemostatic disorders induced by SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. The immunotherapeutic approaches based on the most recent clinical and nonclinical studies, emphasizing their effects for the treatment of COVID-19, are also addressed. The information presented elucidates helpful insights aiming at filling the knowledge gaps around promising immunotherapies that attempt to control the dysfunction of host factors during the course of this infectious viral disease."
9902,Vaccines for COVID-19.,"Since the emergence of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the end of 2019, there has been an explosion of vaccine development. By 24 September 2020, a staggering number of vaccines (more than 200) had started preclinical development, of which 43 had entered clinical trials, including some approaches that have not previously been licensed for human vaccines. Vaccines have been widely considered as part of the exit strategy to enable the return to previous patterns of working, schooling and socializing. Importantly, to effectively control the COVID-19 pandemic, production needs to be scaled-up from a small number of preclinical doses to enough filled vials to immunize the world's population, which requires close engagement with manufacturers and regulators. It will require a global effort to control the virus, necessitating equitable access for all countries to effective vaccines. This review explores the immune responses required to protect against SARS-CoV-2 and the potential for vaccine-induced immunopathology. We describe the profile of the different platforms and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The review also addresses the critical steps between promising preclinical leads and manufacturing at scale. The issues faced during this pandemic and the platforms being developed to address it will be invaluable for future outbreak control. Nine months after the outbreak began we are at a point where preclinical and early clinical data are being generated for the vaccines; an overview of this important area will help our understanding of the next phases."
9903,"Clinical characteristics of 25 death cases with COVID-19: A retrospective review of medical records in a single medical center, Wuhan, China.","Objectives: This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. Methods: The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiological assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Results: The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-dimer, LDH and lactate levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of 25 death cases with COVID-19 we summarized, which would be helpful to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality."
9904,Persistent minimal sequences of SARS-CoV-2.,"Motivation: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 14 million cases and more than half million deaths. Given the absence of implemented therapies, new analysis, diagnosis and therapeutics are of great importance. Results: Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the current outbreak reveals the presence of short persistent DNA/RNA sequences that are absent from the human genome and transcriptome (PmRAWs). For the PmRAWs with length 12, only four exist at the same location in all SARS-CoV-2. At the gene level, we found one PmRAW of size 13 at the Spike glycoprotein coding sequence. This protein is fundamental for binding in human ACE2 and further use as an entry receptor to invade target cells. Applying protein structural prediction, we localized this PmRAW at the surface of the Spike protein, providing a potential targeted vector for diagnostics and therapeutics. In addition, we show a new pattern of relative absent words (RAWs), characterized by the progressive increase of GC content (Guanine and Cytosine) according to the decrease of RAWs length, contrarily to the virus and host genome distributions. New analysis shows the same property during the Ebola virus outbreak. At a computational level, we improved the alignment-free method to identify pathogen-specific signatures in balance with GC measures and removed previous size limitations.

9905,Clinical Properties and Diagnostic Methods of COVID-19 Infection in Pregnancies: Meta-Analysis.,"We aimed to summarize reliable medical evidence by the meta-analysis of all published retrospective studies that examined data based on the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by clinical symptoms, molecular (RT-PCR) diagnosis, and characteristic CT imaging features in pregnant women. The MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, ClinicalKey, and CINAHL databases were used to select the studies. Then, 384 articles were received, including the studies until 01/May/2020. As a result of the full-text evaluation, 12 retrospective articles covering all the data related were selected. A total of 181 pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infections were included in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, the incidence of fever was 38.1% (95% CI: 14.2-65%) and cough was 22% (95% CI: 10.8-35.2%) among all clinical features of pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, fever and cough are the most common symptoms in pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 91.8% (95% CI: 76.7-99.9%) of RT-PCR results are positive. Moreover, abnormal CT incidence is 97.9% (95% CI: 94.2-99.9%) positive. No case was death. However, as this virus spreads globally, it should not be overlooked that the incidence will increase in pregnant women and maybe in the risky group. RT-PCR and CT can be used together in an accurate and safe diagnosis. In conclusion, these findings will provide important guidance for current studies regarding the clinical features and correct detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women, as well as whether it will create emergency tables that will require the use of a viral drug."
9906,COVID-19 and Vaccine Hesitancy: A Challenge the United States Must Overcome.,"A significant portion of the U.S. population may experience vaccine hesitancy of a new COVID-19 vaccine, which poses dangers to both the individual and their community, since exposure to a contagious disease places the person at risk, and individuals are far more likely to spread the disease to others if they do not get vaccinated. Many individuals are doubtful, and without the healthcare community, speaking with one voice has led to distrust. Experience from the influenza vaccines have shown vaccine acceptance has not been optimal, and this new vaccine, even though it is not approved, is already showing layperson skepticism compounded by political influences."
9907,Subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis following COVID-19 vaccination: a case of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA).,"Vaccination injection site adverse reactions are usually mild and transient, and post-vaccination musculoskeletal symptoms, such as myalgia and arthralgia, are very common. Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA), defined as shoulder pain and limited range of motion occurring after the administration of a vaccine intended for intramuscular administration in the upper arm, is a well-established condition in the medical literature, yet underreported. In such cases, subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis may occur, leading to shoulder dysfunction and ongoing pain. Millions of doses of vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 have been administered to adults worldwide during the pandemic. We report a case of subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis after COVID-19 vaccination, related to the unintentional injection of vaccine solution into the bursa resulting in a robust immune-mediated inflammatory reaction."
9908,Bilateral Multifocal Choroiditis following COVID-19 Vaccination.,"Purpose: To report a case of bilateral choroiditis following COVID-19 vaccination.Study Design: Case report.Results: A 34-year old male presented with visual loss one week after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Examination showed large serous detachment of the macula in the right eye and severe choroidal thickening noted on ultrasonography in both eyes. The patient's condition improved rapidly with oral corticosteroids with significant resolution of the serous detachments within two weeks of initiating treatment and complete visual recovery subsequently.Conclusions: The onset of ocular symptoms starting within one week following vaccination suggests an inflammatory or autoimmune response to the vaccine. Ophthalmologists should consider the option of autoimmune and other inflammatory ocular problems, which may manifest as uveitis, following COVID-19 vaccination. Timely diagnosis and treatment with corticosteroids can result in good visual and structural outcome."
9909,Pregnancy and childbirth during the coronavirus pandemic - current stage of knowledge.,"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), is a new strain of β-coronavirus. At the time of the current pandemic, pregnant women fear of infection by this pathogen and related consequences both for themselves and for their children. Adaptive changes occurring in the body of a pregnant woman can increase her susceptibility to infections, especially when it concerns the cardiopulmonary system. Clinical data relating to infection by this pathogen, referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant women are still limited. Most of the cases in which these data are available apply to the third trimester of pregnancy. This article provides an overview of a current knowledge and recommendations regarding the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and its impact on the pregnancy outcome."
