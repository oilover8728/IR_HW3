4110,"Covid-19, Pregnancy, and Vaccinations.","Pregnancy in the presence of COVID-19 increases the risk for illness severity. Data suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized, to be admitted to the intensive care unit, and to require life support. Vaccination is currently considered the most effective preventive intervention against COVID-19 in the United States. However, the unsurprising exclusion of pregnant women as participants in initial COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials has led to a gap in the scientific data regarding the safety profile and subsequent use of COVID-19 vaccine for women who are pregnant. Experts believe current COVID-19 vaccines developed using either mRNA or viral vector vaccine technologies and authorized for emergency use by the United States Food and Drug Administration are unlikely to pose obstetrical or neonatal risks. Still, current vaccination recommendations for women who are pregnant have been both mixed and contradictory. The need to expeditiously identify, collate, and disseminate available vaccine-related safety data is critical to preventing severe illness while also advancing the health and wellness of an underserved high-risk population subgroup."
4111,"Risk factors and predictors that influence SARS-Cov-2 IgG positivity: A cross-sectional study of blood donors in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Objectives: To study the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after pandemic's peak and before the vaccine enrollment in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and further explore predictors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 515 blood donors from November 22 to December 17, 2020 was conducted at King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to look at SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) positivity. The participants were asked questions about their demographic characteristics, past SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms and exposures. Results: The seroprevalence in our study was 12.2% (n=63/515). Being a non-citizen was associated with significantly higher seroprevalence (OR 2.10, p=0.02). Participants with history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure or symptoms regardless of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis had higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity compared to unexposed or asymptomatic participants (OR 2.47, p=0.0008 or 11.19, p=0.0001, respectively). Blood donors who had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 IgG infection had a higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity rate (OR 5.04, p=0.008) and index value (p=0.003) than the asymptomatic. Of all the reported symptoms, cough (p=0.004) and anosmia (p=0.002) were significant predictors of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among the blood donors in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia is considerably lower than the percentages necessary for herd immunity. Developing SARS-CoV-2-symptoms is the critical factor for higher seropositivity after SARS-CoV-2 exposure."
4112,Revealing Public Opinion Towards COVID-19 Vaccines With Twitter Data in the United States: Spatiotemporal Perspective.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a large, initially uncontrollable, public health crisis both in the United States and across the world, with experts looking to vaccines as the ultimate mechanism of defense. The development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly advancing via global efforts. Hence, it is crucial for governments, public health officials, and policy makers to understand public attitudes and opinions towards vaccines, such that effective interventions and educational campaigns can be designed to promote vaccine acceptance. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate public opinion and perception on COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. We investigated the spatiotemporal trends of public sentiment and emotion towards COVID-19 vaccines and analyzed how such trends relate to popular topics found on Twitter. Methods: We collected over 300,000 geotagged tweets in the United States from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of public sentiment and emotion over time at both national and state scales and identified 3 phases along the pandemic timeline with sharp changes in public sentiment and emotion. Using sentiment analysis, emotion analysis (with cloud mapping of keywords), and topic modeling, we further identified 11 key events and major topics as the potential drivers to such changes. Results: An increasing trend in positive sentiment in conjunction with a decrease in negative sentiment were generally observed in most states, reflecting the rising confidence and anticipation of the public towards vaccines. The overall tendency of the 8 types of emotion implies that the public trusts and anticipates the vaccine. This is accompanied by a mixture of fear, sadness, and anger. Critical social or international events or announcements by political leaders and authorities may have potential impacts on public opinion towards vaccines. These factors help identify underlying themes and validate insights from the analysis. Conclusions: The analyses of near real-time social media big data benefit public health authorities by enabling them to monitor public attitudes and opinions towards vaccine-related information in a geo-aware manner, address the concerns of vaccine skeptics, and promote the confidence that individuals within a certain region or community have towards vaccines."
4113,The post-lockdown period should be used to acquire effective therapies for future resurgence in SARS-Cov-2 infections.,"COVID-19 will be with us through the remainder of 2020 and almost certainly beyond. New Zealand needs a viable strategy to protect its populace until a vaccine is developed and in wide use. Until that time, it makes sense to protect the population by putting in place treatments that will be safe and effective, such as the use of convalescent sera and the use of direct-acting anti-virals. These treatments should be sourced externally or made locally, but steps in this direction must now begin as the lockdown ends. New Zealand has the scientists, the facilities and the will to make this happen, but the support of the government and the population will be needed if this plan is to succeed."
4114,Vaccination against COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of acceptability and its predictors.,"We aimed to estimate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine acceptance rate and identify predictors associated with acceptance. To this end, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases until November 4, 2020. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the rate with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Predictors were identified to be associated with vaccination intention based on the health belief model framework. Thirty-eight articles, with 81,173 individuals, were included. The pooled COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate was 73.31% (95%CI: 70.52, 76.01). Studies using representative samples reported a rate of 73.16%. The pooled acceptance rate among the general population (81.65%) was higher than that among healthcare workers (65.65%). Gender, educational level, influenza vaccination history, and trust in the government were strong predictors of COVID-19 vaccination willingness. People who received an influenza vaccination in the last year were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccination (odds ratio: 3.165; 95%CI: 1.842, 5.464). Protecting oneself or others was the main reason for willingness, and concerns about side effects and safety were the main reasons for unwillingness. National- and individual-level interventions can be implemented to improve COVID-19 vaccine acceptance before large-scale vaccine rollout. Greater efforts could be put into addressing negative predictors associated with willingness."

4116,The impact of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection on ambulatory procedures and associated delays in care for asymptomatic patients.,"Background: Since the reopening of ambulatory centers, minimal data has been reported regarding positive tests among patients undergoing ambulatory procedures, associated delays in care, and outcomes of patients previously positive for coronavirus disease 2019. Methods: A retrospective observational case series of ambulatory procedures was performed. Records since the reopening of ambulatory centers in New York were searched for patients with positive coronavirus disease 2019 nasal swab results who underwent ambulatory procedures. Chart reviews were conducted to determine coronavirus disease history and hospitalizations, demographic information, procedure details, and 30-day admissions. Results: A total of 3,762 patients underwent ambulatory procedures. Of those, 53 were previously diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 but recovered and tested negative at preprocedural testing. Of the 3,709 asymptomatic patients, 37 (1.00%) tested positive during preprocedural testing; 21 patients had their procedures delayed on average 28.6 days until testing negative, while 16 had their procedures performed before testing negative owing to the time sensitivity of the procedure. There were no major complications or 30-day admissions in any of these asymptomatic patients. Three patients tested positive for coronavirus disease after having an ambulatory procedure. Conclusion: Positive tests in asymptomatic patients led to procedure delays of 28.6 days. No patients who underwent ambulatory procedures after a positive coronavirus disease 2019 test had any coronavirus disease-related complications, regardless of whether or not the procedure was delayed until testing negative. Three patients tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 after having an ambulatory procedure; however, at an average of 19.7 days after, these cases were likely community acquired making the rate of nosocomial infection negligible."
4117,LBP-based information assisted intelligent system for COVID-19 identification.,"A real-time COVID-19 detection system is an utmost requirement of the present situation. This article presents a chest X-ray image-based automated COVID-19 detection system which can be employed with the RT-PCR test to improve the diagnosis rate. In the proposed approach, the textural features are extracted from the chest X-ray images and local binary pattern (LBP) based images. Further, the image-based and LBP image-based features are jointly investigated. Thereafter, highly discriminatory features are provided to the classifier for developing an automated model for COVID-19 identification. The performance of the proposed approach is investigated over 2905 chest X-ray images of normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 infected persons on various class combinations to analyze the robustness. The developed method achieves 97.97% accuracy (acc) and 99.88% sensitivity (sen) for classifying COVID-19 X-ray images against pneumonia infected and normal person's X-ray images. It attains 98.91% acc and 99.33% sen for COVID-19 X-ray against the normal X-ray classification. This method can be employed to assist the radiologists during mass screening for fast, accurate, and contact-free COVID-19 diagnosis."
4118,Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in young children do not differ significantly from those in older children and adults.,"The role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has become a matter of urgent debate as societies in the US and abroad consider how to safely reopen schools. Small studies have suggested higher viral loads in young children. Here we present a multicenter investigation on over five thousand SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR assay. Notably, we found no discernable difference in amount of viral nucleic acid among young children and adults."
4119,Performance of 4 Automated SARS-CoV-2 Serology Assay Platforms in a Large Cohort Including Susceptible COVID-19-Negative and COVID-19-Positive Patients.,"Background: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological responses may have a vital role in controlling the spread of the disease. However, the comparative performance of automated serological assays has not been determined in susceptible patients with significant comorbidities. Methods: In this study, we used large numbers of samples from patients who were negative (n = 2030) or positive (n = 112) for COVID-19 to compare the performance of 4 serological assay platforms: Siemens Healthineers Atellica IM Analyzer, Siemens Healthineers Dimension EXL Systems, Abbott ARCHITECT, and Roche cobas. Results: All 4 serology assay platforms exhibited comparable negative percentage of agreement with negative COVID-19 status ranging from 99.2% to 99.7% and positive percentage of agreement from 84.8% to 87.5% with positive real-time reverse transcriptase PCR results. Of the 2142 total samples, only 38 samples (1.8%) yielded discordant results on one or more platforms. However, only 1.1% (23/2030) of results from the COVID-19-negative cohort were discordant. whereas discordance was 10-fold higher for the COVID-19-positive cohort, at 11.3% (15/112). Of the total 38 discordant results, 34 were discordant on only one platform. Conclusions: Serology assay performance was comparable across the 4 platforms assessed in a large population of patients who were COVID-19 negative with relevant comorbidities. The pattern of discordance shows that samples were discordant on a single assay platform, and the discordance rate was 10-fold higher in the population that was COVID-19 positive."
