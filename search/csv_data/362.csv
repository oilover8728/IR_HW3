3610,COVID-19 epidemic strongly affected cancer research in Italy: a survey of the Italian Cancer Society (SIC).,"Background: Italy was among the first countries hit by the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The application of strict lockdown measures disproportionately affected both cancer patient care as well as basic and translational cancer research. Materials and methods: The Italian Cancer Society (SIC) conducted a survey on the effect of lockdown on laboratories involved in cancer research in Italy. The survey was completed by 570 researchers at different stages of their career, working in cancer centers, research institutes and universities from 19 Italian regions. Results: During the lockdown period, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency on face-to-face research activities was high, with a complete (47.7%) or partial (36.1%) shutdown of the laboratories. In the post-lockdown period, research activities were resumed in most of the respondents' institutions (80.4%), though with some restrictions (77.2%). COVID-19 testing was offered to research personnel only in ~50% of research institutions. Overall, the response to the pandemic was fragmented as in many cases institutions adopted different strategies often aimed at limiting possible infections without a clearly defined contingency plan. Nevertheless, research was able to provide the first answers and possible ways out of the pandemic, also with the contribution of many cancer researchers that sacrificed their research programs to help overcome the pandemic by offering their knowledge and technologies. Conclusions: Given the current persistence of an emergency situation in many European countries, a more adequate organization of research centers will be urgent and necessary to ensure the continuity of laboratory activities in a safe environment."
3611,[Epistaxis after testing for COVID-19].,"Background: Testing for airway microbes has increased during the current COVID-19 pandemic. This case report demonstrates that testing can lead to complications. Case presentation: A man in his seventies was transferred to our hospital for coronary angiography. On admission he underwent testing with nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19. He started bleeding profusely from the nostril insertion site. The haemorrhage was controlled by bilateral anterior and posterior balloon tamponade, the coronary angiography was postponed, he was given a transfusion of packed red blood cells and had to spend a total of nine days in hospital. Interpretation: The World Health Organization recommends screening of all patients for COVID-19 upon admission to hospital. The risk of every procedure must be carefully considered in relation to the benefits, especially when large numbers of patients are affected. For our patient, the likelihood of COVID-19 infection was low, and the risk of complications was high."
3612,Brief review of the mRNA vaccines COVID-19.,"The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to claim victims worldwide, representing a health and socioeconomic challenge with few precedents in human history. The therapeutic agents used to treat COVID-19 infection are mostly aimed at avoiding the most serious complications and organ damage that in a percentage of cases can be fatal. Recently, the first COVID-19 vaccines have been authorised, starting a massive vaccination campaign worldwide. The COVID-19 vaccines authorized or under testing use different methods of action such as mRNA, DNA vaccine, viral vector, protein subunit, and virus inactivated immunization strategies. The mRNA vaccines are the first authorised vaccines with this new method of action, initiating a new era of preventive medicine. To date, data indicate that they may be effective against the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 variants. Short-term studies indicated an acceptable safety profile but long-term immunity as well as safety is not yet available. In this article, we briefly describe mRNA vaccines and highlight some aspects yet to be fully defined."
3613,Comparison of the simultaneous conjunctiva and oropharynx-nasopharynx swab results in patients applying to the SARS-CoV-2 outpatient clinic for the first time.,"The aim is to comparatively evaluate the results of simultaneous conjunctiva and oropharynx-nasopharynx (ONP) swabs in patients who had presented to the outpatient department with a suspicion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). An ONP sample was obtained following bilateral conjunctiva swabs in 85 subjects with a contact history or symptoms but unknown SARS-CoV-2 status and with no ocular symptoms or findings. The results were evaluated according to the patient's symptoms and how the swab was taken. The conjunctiva swab was positive in 29 (34.1%) cases and the ONP swab in 20 (23.5%) cases. Both methods produced positive results in 11 (14.1%) cases. The mean cycle threshold (Ct ) value was 30.15 ± 3.41 in symptomatic cases and 33.62 ± 1.76 in asymptomatic cases (p = .008). The mean Ct value was 24.37 ± 3.48 when only the ONP swab was positive and 31.22 ± 1.99 when only the conjunctiva swab was positive. In cases that were positive by both methods, the mean Ct value was 25.21 ± 4.94 for the ONP swab and 30.29 ± 5.05 for the conjunctiva swab. We found higher SARS-CoV-2 detection rates with the conjunctiva swab than the ONP swab in cases with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status in the early period. In addition, the conjunctival viral load seemed to be higher in symptomatic cases than in asymptomatic cases. We, therefore, believe a conjunctiva swab could be an alternative method to detect SARS-CoV-2 at the time of the first presentation to the outpatient department."

3616,SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Immune Response in Exogenously Immunosuppressed Patients.,"Background: While it is presumed that immunosuppressed patients, such as solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppression, are at greater risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population, the antibody response to infection in this patient population has not been studied. Methods: In this report, we follow the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in patients with COVID-19 who are undergoing exogenous immunosuppression. Specifically, we studied the antibody response of 3 solid organ transplant recipient patients, 3 patients who take daily inhaled fluticasone, and a patient on etanercept and daily inhaled fluticasone, and compared them to 5 patients not on exogenous immunosuppression. Results: We found that the solid organ transplant patients on full immunosuppression are at risk of having a delayed antibody response and poor outcome. We did not find evidence that inhaled steroids or etanercept predispose patients to delayed immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: The data presented here suggest that solid organ transplant recipients may be good candidates for early targeted intervention against SARS-CoV-2."
3617,"Microsampling: A role to play in Covid-19 diagnosis, surveillance, treatment and clinical trials.","The outbreak of the new coronavirus disease changed the world upside down. Every day, millions of people were subjected to diagnostic testing for Covid-19, all over the world. Molecular tests helped in the diagnosis of current infection by detecting the presence of viral genome whereas serological tests helped in detecting the presence of antibody in blood as well as contributed to vaccine development. This testing helped in understanding the immunogenicity, community prevalence, geographical spread and conditions post-infection. However, with the contagious nature of the virus, biological specimen sampling involved the risk of transmission and spread of infection. Clinic or pathology visit was the most concerning part. Trained personnel and resources was another barrier. In this scenario, microsampling played an important role due to its most important advantage of remote, contactless, small volume and self-sampling. Minimum requirements for sample storage and ease of shipment added value in this situation. The highly sensitive instruments and validated assay formats assured the accuracy of results and stability of samples. Microsampling techniques are contributing effectively to the Covid-19 pandemic by reducing the demand for clinical staff in population-level testing. The validated and established applications supported the use of microsampling in diagnosis, therapeutic drug monitoring, development of treatment or vaccines and clinical trials for Covid-19."

3619,Diagnostic yield of repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2: Experience from a large health system in Los Angeles.,"Objective: To determine the diagnostic yield of repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of all SARS-CoV-2 test results within the UCLA Health System between March 9th and April 29th, 2020. All patients with repeat test results were identified and those with discordant results were reviewed. Results: Between March 9th and April 29th there were 10,165 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 630 (6.2%) were positive. Among the 904 patients with repeat test results, 808 (89.4%) were initially negative and 96 (10.6%) were initially positive. Among the 808 patients with an initial negative test, 15 (1.9%) subsequently tested positive. Eleven cases with an initial negative SARS-CoV-2 test and without a known prior positive SARS-CoV-2 test were reviewed; 6 were employed as healthcare workers and 10 were positive on the second test. Conclusions: We found a low diagnostic yield of repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2 in our health system. Repeat testing might prove useful in certain clinical scenarios, such as in healthcare workers, when symptoms develop after a negative test, and in hospitalized patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19."
