1610,"Universal Admission Screening for SARS-CoV-2 Infections among Hospitalized Patients, Switzerland, 2020.","Switzerland began a national lockdown on March 16, 2020, in response to the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients admitted to 4 hospitals in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, in April 2020. These 4 acute care hospitals screened 2,807 patients, including 2,278 (81.2%) who did not have symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Overall, 529 (18.8%) persons had >1 symptom of COVID-19, of whom 60 (11.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Eight asymptomatic persons (0.4%) also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings indicate that screening on the basis of COVID-19 symptoms, regardless of clinical suspicion, can identify most SARS-CoV-2-positive persons in a low-prevalence setting."
1611,Filling the gaps in the characterization of the clinical management of COVID-19: 30-day hospital admission and fatality rates in a cohort of 118 150 cases diagnosed in outpatient settings in Spain.,"Background: Currently, there is a missing link in the natural history of COVID-19, from first (usually milder) symptoms to hospitalization and/or death. To fill in this gap, we characterized COVID-19 patients at the time at which they were diagnosed in outpatient settings and estimated 30-day hospital admission and fatality rates. Methods: This was a population-based cohort study. Data were obtained from Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP)-a primary-care records database covering >6 million people (>80% of the population of Catalonia), linked to COVID-19 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and hospital emergency, inpatient and mortality registers. We included all patients in the database who were ≥15 years old and diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient settings between 15 March and 24 April 2020 (10 April for outcome studies). Baseline characteristics included socio-demographics, co-morbidity and previous drug use at the time of diagnosis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and results. Study outcomes included 30-day hospitalization for COVID-19 and all-cause fatality. Results: We identified 118 150 and 95 467 COVID-19 patients for characterization and outcome studies, respectively. Most were women (58.7%) and young-to-middle-aged (e.g. 21.1% were 45-54 years old). Of the 44 575 who were tested with PCR, 32 723 (73.4%) tested positive. In the month after diagnosis, 14.8% (14.6-15.0) were hospitalized, with a greater proportion of men and older people, peaking at age 75-84 years. Thirty-day fatality was 3.5% (95% confidence interval: 3.4% to 3.6%), higher in men, increasing with age and highest in those residing in nursing homes [24.5% (23.4% to 25.6%)]. Conclusion: COVID-19 infections were widespread in the community, including all age-sex strata. However, severe forms of the disease clustered in older men and nursing-home residents. Although initially managed in outpatient settings, 15% of cases required hospitalization and 4% died within a month of first symptoms. These data are instrumental for designing deconfinement strategies and will inform healthcare planning and hospital-bed allocation in current and future COVID-19 outbreaks."
1612,Comparison of the diagnostic efficacy between two PCR test kits for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection.,"Background: To compare the diagnostic efficacy between two different real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid detection and provide references for laboratories. Methods: Throat swab samples from 18 hospitalized patients were clinically diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 100 hospitalized patients without COVID-19 were collected. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in throat swab samples with RT-PCR test kits from Sansure Biotech Inc (Hunan, China) and Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and kappa value were analyzed, and three parallel tests were performed with three weakly positive samples. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and kappa value of the Sansure PCR kit were 0.833, 1.000, 1.000, 0.971, and 0.894, respectively, and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and kappa value of the BioGerm PCR kit were 0.944, 1.000, 1.000, 0.990, and 0.966, respectively. For the three parallel tests, the coefficient of variation value of the BioGerm PCR kit in all three samples was the smallest for both the ORF1ab and N gene. Conclusion: The detection efficacy of the BioGerm PCR kit for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was relatively higher than that of the Sansure PCR kit."
1613,Diagnosing the novel SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative RT-PCR: variations and opportunities.,"The world is currently facing a novel viral pandemic (SARS-CoV-2), and large-scale testing is central to decision-making for the design of effective policies and control strategies to minimize its impact on the global population. However, testing for the presence of the virus is a major bottleneck in tracking the spreading of the disease. Given its adaptability regarding the nucleotide sequence of target regions, RT-qPCR is a strong ally to reveal the rapid geographical spreading of novel viruses. We assessed PCR variations in the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis taking into account public genome sequences and diagnosis kits used by different countries. We analyzed 226 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from samples collected by March 22, 2020. Our work utilizes a phylogenetic approach that reveals the early evolution of the virus sequence as it spreads around the globe and informs the design of RT-qPCR primers and probes. The quick expansion of testing capabilities of a country during a pandemic is largely impaired by the availability of adequately trained personnel on RNA isolation and PCR analysis, as well as the availability of hardware (thermocyclers). We propose that rapid capacity development can circumvent these bottlenecks by training medical and non-medical personnel with some laboratory experience, such as biology-related graduate students. Furthermore, the use of thermocyclers available in academic and commercial labs can be promptly calibrated and certified to properly conduct testing during a pandemic. A decentralized, fast-acting training and testing certification pipeline will better prepare us to manage future pandemics."

1615,Symptomatic Acute Myocarditis in 7 Adolescents After Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccination.,"Trials of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination included limited numbers of children, so they may not have detected rare but important adverse events in this population. We report 7 cases of acute myocarditis or myopericarditis in healthy male adolescents who presented with chest pain all within 4 days after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination. Five patients had fever around the time of presentation. Acute COVID-19 was ruled out in all 7 cases on the basis of negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test results of specimens obtained by using nasopharyngeal swabs. None of the patients met criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Six of the 7 patients had negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleocapsid antibody assay results, suggesting no previous infection. All patients had an elevated troponin. Cardiac MRI revealed late gadolinium enhancement characteristic of myocarditis. All 7 patients resolved their symptoms rapidly. Three patients were treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs only, and 4 received intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids. In this report, we provide a summary of each adolescent's clinical course and evaluation. No causal relationship between vaccine administration and myocarditis has been established. Continued monitoring and reporting to the US Food and Drug Administration Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is strongly recommended."
1616,Dominance of Alpha and Iota variants in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections in New York City.,"The efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is high, but breakthrough infections still occur. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 76 breakthrough cases after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), or JNJ-78436735 (Janssen) to unvaccinated controls (February-April 2021) in metropolitan New York, including their phylogenetic relationship, distribution of variants, and full spike mutation profiles. The median age of patients in the study was 48 years; 7 required hospitalization and 1 died. Most breakthrough infections (57/76) occurred with B.1.1.7 (Alpha) or B.1.526 (Iota). Among the 7 hospitalized cases, 4 were infected with B.1.1.7, including 1 death. Both unmatched and matched statistical analyses considering age, sex, vaccine type, and study month as covariates supported the null hypothesis of equal variant distributions between vaccinated and unvaccinated in χ2 and McNemar tests (P > 0.1), highlighting a high vaccine efficacy against B.1.1.7 and B.1.526. There was no clear association among breakthroughs between type of vaccine received and variant. In the vaccinated group, spike mutations in the N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain that have been associated with immune evasion were overrepresented. The evolving dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 variants requires broad genomic analyses of breakthrough infections to provide real-life information on immune escape mediated by circulating variants and their spike mutations."
1617,IABS/CEPI platform technology webinar: Is it possible to reduce the vaccine development time?,"The International Alliance for Biological Standardization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations organized a joint webinar on the use of platform technologies for vaccine development. To tackle new emerging infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, rapid response platforms, using the same basic components as a backbone, yet adaptable for use against different pathogens by inserting new genetic or protein sequences, are essential. Furthermore, it is evident that development of platform technologies needs to continue, due to the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. The objective of the meeting was to discuss techniques for platform manufacturing that have been used for COVID-19 vaccine development, with input from regulatory authorities on their experiences with, and expectations of, the platforms. Industry and regulators have been very successful in cooperating, having completed the whole process from development to licensing at an unprecedented speed. However, we should learn from the experiences, to be able to be even faster when a next pandemic of disease X occurs."
1618,T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection and vaccination.,"SARS-CoV-2 first emerged in the human population in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and in a matter of months, spread across the globe resulting in the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and substantial economic fallout. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between humans via respiratory particles, with infection presenting a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to respiratory failure with multiorgan dysfunction and death in severe cases. Prior experiences with human pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory virus diseases in general have revealed an important role for cellular immunity in limiting disease severity. Here, we review some of the key mechanisms underlying cell-mediated immunity to respiratory viruses and summarize our current understanding of the functional capacity and role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells following natural infection and vaccination."
1619,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among healthcare workers in a university hospital in Mallorca, Spain, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Objective: To estimate the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in healthcare workers (HCWs) at a university hospital in Mallorca, Spain. Methods: All HCWs received an e-mail inviting them to take part in the study. Participants had a nasopharyngeal swab test performed for reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and serological tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (primary study). Additionally, they were invited to complete a questionnaire on their exposure to COVID-19 individuals and their COVID-19-related symptoms (secondary study). Prevalence of antibodies (IgG, IgM, or both) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Seventy-nine percent of the hospital's HCWs (N = 2210) took part in the primary study. Antibodies were detected in 61 participants, a prevalence of 2.8% (95% CI: 2.5-3.1). The prevalence was slightly higher in nurses (3.4%), registrars (3.9%), and wardens (3.4%). Thirty-nine percent of the primary study participants completed the secondary study questionnaire. Those with positive antibody test results had closer contact with COVID-19 individuals (60% vs. 92%; p < 0.001). Conclusion: After the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in our university hospital HCWs was around 2.8%, which is slightly higher than the seroprevalence in the general population in our region. We believe it would be advisable to perform additional seroprevalence studies during the second wave of the epidemic."
