5750,Impact of both socioeconomic level and occupation on antibody prevalence to SARS-CoV-2 in an Egyptian cohort: The first episode.,"We studied the impact of socioeconomic level on the anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibodies prevalence in an Egyptian cohort. The low socioeconomic standard group (LSS) included 51 humans, 30 females (F) and 21 males (M). The high socioeconomic standard group (HSS) included 55 subjects, 24 F and 31 M. Of the 30 LSSF, 6 were immunoglobulin M (IgM), 21 immunoglobulin G (IgG), and 6 double positive. Of the 21 LSSM, 5 were IgM, 12 IgG, and 5 double positive. Of the 24 HSSF, 6 were IgM, 11 IgG, and 5 double positive. Of the 31 HSSM, 6 were IgM, 14 IgG, and 4 double positive. Of the 51 LSS humans, 26 were symptomatic (S) and 25 asymptomatic (AS). Of the 26 S, 20 were IgG and 8 IgM/IgG double positive. Of the 25 AS, 13 were IgG and 3 IgM/IgG double positive. Of the 55 HSS humans, 38 were S and 17 AS. Of the 38S, 24 were IgG and 11 IgM positive of whom, 9 were double positive. Of the 17 AS, one was IgG and one IgM positive. The IgM prevalence was higher among the HSS humans. The IgG prevalence was significantly higher among the LSS humans. In the two different socioeconomic standards, the prevalence of either IgM or IgG was higher among F. An inverse correlation was observed between age and the anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibodies prevalence except for LSSF-IgG and LSSM-IgM. In conclusion, socioeconomic standard, gender, and age impact humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 with a clear heterogeneity in individualized responses to the infection in terms of symptoms."
5751,Increasing host cellular receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression by coronavirus may facilitate 2019-nCoV (or SARS-CoV-2) infection.,"The ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) has caused an epidemic of the acute respiratory syndrome known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in humans. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to multiple regions of China and multiple other countries, posing a serious threat to public health. The spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 may use the same host cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entering host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is much higher than that of ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV S protein, explaining why SARS-CoV-2 seems to be more readily transmitted from human to human. Here, we report that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, or by the stimulation with inflammatory cytokines such as interferons. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 may positively induce its cellular entry receptor, ACE2, to accelerate its replication and spread; high inflammatory cytokine levels increase ACE2 expression and act as high-risk factors for developing COVID-19, and the infection of other viruses may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, drugs targeting ACE2 may be developed for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of coronaviruses."

5753,Breastfeeding and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccination: Position Statement of Indian Academy of Pediatrics Advisory Committee on Vaccination and Immunization Practices.,"Justification: In India, till recently, breastfeeding women have been excluded from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination program, rendering a significant population of the country, including frontline workers, ineligible to derive the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Objective: The objective of this recommendation is production of an evidence-based document to guide the pediatricians to give advice to breastfeeding mothers regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating women. Process: Formulation of key question was done under the chairmanship of president of the IAP. It was followed by review of literature regarding efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in breastfeeding women. The recommendations of other international and national professional bodies were also deliberated in detail. The available data was discussed in the ACVIP focused WhatsApp group. Opinion of all members was taken and the final document was prepared after achieving consensus. Recommendations: The IAP/ACVIP recommends the administration of COVID-19 vaccines to all breastfeeding women. The IAP/ACVIP endorses the recent recommendation of the Government of India, to consider all breastfeeding women as eligible for COVID-19 vaccination."

5756,COVID-19 among people with diabetes mellitus in Saudi Arabia: Current situation and new perspectives.,"Background and aim: This review aims to report the current status of COVID-19 among people with diabetes, newly diagnosed diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, and programmatic efforts including vaccinations. Methods: We conducted a literature search using PubMed, Google, and Scopus until July 15, 2021. Results: In Saudi Arabia, most studies have reported diabetes as one of the highly prevalent comorbidities among patients with COVID-19. Currently, there are limited studies from Saudi Arabia on the newly diagnosed diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis caused by COVID-19. The Saudi ministry has taken several measures to control the impact of COVID-19 among people with diabetes, including comprehensive guidelines and prioritized vaccinations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telehealth services dramatically increased in diabetes clinics in Saudi Arabia. Conclusions: Focused and evidence-based interventions are essential to control the impact of COVID-19 among people with diabetes."
5757,Bioinformatic HLA Studies in the Context of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and Review on Association of HLA Alleles with Preexisting Medical Conditions.,"After the announcement of a new coronavirus in China in December 2019, which was then called SARS-CoV-2, this virus changed to a global concern and it was then declared as a pandemic by WHO. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which are one of the most polymorphic genes, play a pivotal role in both resistance and vulnerability of the body against viruses and other infections as well as chronic diseases. The association between HLA alleles and preexisting medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus is reported in various studies. In this review, we focused on the bioinformatic HLA studies to summarize the HLA alleles which responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides and have been used to design vaccines. We also reviewed HLA alleles that are associated with comorbidities and might be related to the high mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. Since both genes and patients' medical conditions play a key role in both severity of the disease and the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients, a better understanding of the connection between HLA alleles and SARS-CoV-2 can provide a wider perspective on the behavior of the virus. Such understanding can help scientists, especially in terms of protecting healthcare workers and designing effective vaccines."

Since then, the development and implementation of vaccines against the virus amidst emerging cases of re-infection has prompted researchers to work towards understanding how immunity develops and is sustained. Serological testing has been instrumental in monitoring the development and persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection, however inconsistencies in detection have been reported by different methods. As serological testing becomes more commonplace, it is important to establish widespread and repeatable processes for monitoring vaccine efficacy. Therefore, we present enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) compatible for antibody detection in saliva as highly accurate, efficacious, and scalable tools for studying the immune response in individuals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2."
