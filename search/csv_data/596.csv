5951,"A clinical, histopathological and laboratory study of 19 consecutive Italian paediatric patients with chilblain-like lesions: lights and shadows on the relationship with COVID-19 infection.","Background: Acral chilblain-like lesions are being increasingly reported during COVID-19 pandemic. However, only few patients proved positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The relationship between this skin manifestation and COVID-19 infection has not been clarified yet. Objective: To thoroughly characterize a prospective group of patients with chilblain-like lesions and to investigate the possible relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Following informed consent, patients underwent (i) clinical evaluation, (ii) RT-PCR and serology testing for SARS-CoV-2, (iii) digital videocapillaroscopy of finger and toe nailfolds, (iv) blood testing to screen for autoimmune diseases and coagulation anomalies, and (v) skin biopsy for histopathology, direct immunofluorescence and, in selected cases, electron microscopy. Results: Nineteen patients, all adolescents (mean age: 14 years), were recruited. 11/19 (58%) of them and/or their cohabitants reported flu-like symptoms one to two months prior to skin manifestation onset. Lesions were localized to toes and also heels and soles. Videocapillaroscopy showed pericapillary oedema, dilated and abnormal capillaries, and microhaemorrhages both in finger and toe in the majority of patients. Major pathological findings included epidermal basal layer vacuolation, papillary dermis oedema and erythrocyte extravasation, perivascular and perieccrine dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, and mucin deposition in the dermis and hypodermis; dermal vessel thrombi were observed in two cases. Blood examinations were normal. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and IgG serology for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were negative. Importantly, IgA serology for S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was positive in 6 patients and borderline in 3. Conclusions: Chilblain-like lesions during COVID-19 pandemic have specific epidemiologic, clinical, capillaroscopic and histopathological characteristics, which distinguish them from idiopathic perniosis. Though we could not formally prove SARS-CoV-2 infection in our patients, history data and the detection of anti-SARS-COV-2 IgA strongly suggest a relationship between skin lesions and COVID-19. Further investigations on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and pathogenesis of chilblain-like lesions are warranted."
5952,Healthcare Resource Use in Patients with Immune-Mediated Conditions Treated with Targeted Immunomodulators During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Claims Analysis.,"Introduction: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine medical care may result in altered healthcare resource use in patients with immune-mediated conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of treatment interruptions in patients with and without COVID-19 infections who were treated with targeted immunomodulators (TIMs) in the USA. Methods: Data from the IBM® MarketScan® Research Databases were analyzed in patients with immune-mediated conditions from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020. Healthcare resource use (HCRU) including hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, in-person outpatient visits, and respiratory outcomes was assessed in a cohort of patients without COVID-19 who had uninterrupted versus interrupted TIM use. The impact of treatment interruption on HCRU and respiratory outcomes was also evaluated in a cohort of patients with COVID-19. Results from adjusted logistic regression were reported as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Approximately 25% of patients in both the COVID-19 (N = 787) and non-COVID-19 cohorts (N = 77,178) experienced interruptions in TIM therapy. In the non-COVID-19 cohort, the likelihood of being hospitalized was 20% less in patients with uninterrupted versus interrupted TIM use (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.90). Patients with uninterrupted TIM use had a similar likelihood of an ED visit (aOR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.91-1.08) and respiratory outcome (aOR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.71-1.31) versus patients with interrupted TIM use. The likelihood of having an in-person outpatient visit was 87% greater in patients with uninterrupted versus interrupted TIM use (aOR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.81-1.94). Similar findings were observed in the COVID-19 cohort. Conclusion: This analysis of real-world claims data showed that uninterrupted TIM use was not associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalizations, ED visits, or negative respiratory outcomes compared to interrupted TIM use among patients with immune-mediated conditions, regardless of COVID-19 diagnosis."
5953,Disparities in H1N1 Vaccination Rates: a Systematic Review and Evidence Synthesis to Inform COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts.,"Background: Data suggest that there were disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake, and these may inform COVID-19 vaccination efforts. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake, factors contributing to disparities, and interventions to reduce them. Methods: We searched English-language articles in MEDLINE ALL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception through May 8, 2020. Observational studies examining H1N1 vaccine uptake by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rurality, and disability status in US settings were included. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility. Single-reviewer data abstraction was confirmed by a second reviewer. We conducted independent dual quality assessment, and collective strength of evidence assessment. Results: We included 21 studies. African American/Black, Latino, and low-socioeconomic status participants had disproportionately lower H1N1 vaccination rates (low- to moderate-strength evidence). However, Latinos were more likely than Whites to intend to be vaccinated, and African American/Blacks and participants with lower-socioeconomic status were just as likely to intend to be vaccinated as their White and higher-socioeconomic status counterparts (low-strength evidence). Vaccine uptake for other groups has been insufficiently studied. Factors potentially contributing to disparities in vaccine uptake included barriers to vaccine access, inadequate information, and concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. Studies were largely cross-sectional. Many of the studies are a decade old and were conducted in the context of a different pandemic. The categorization of racial and ethnic groups was not consistent across studies and not all groups were well-studied. Discussion: Efforts to avoid disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake should prioritize vaccine accessibility and convenience in African American/Black, Latino, and low-SES communities; engage trusted stakeholders to share vaccine information; and address concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy.

5954,The French public's attitudes to a future COVID-19 vaccine: The politicization of a public health issue.,"As Covid-19 spreads across the world, governments turn a hopeful eye towards research and development of a vaccine against this new disease. But it is one thing to make a vaccine available, and it is quite another to convince the public to take the shot, as the precedent of the 2009 H1N1 influenza illustrated. In this paper, we present the results of four online surveys conducted in April 2020 in representative samples of the French population 18 years of age and over (N = 5018). These surveys were conducted during a period when the French population was on lockdown and the daily number of deaths attributed to the virus reached its peak. We found that if a vaccine against the new coronavirus became available, almost a quarter of respondents would not use it. We also found that attitudes to this vaccine were correlated significantly with political partisanship and engagement with the political system. Attitudes towards this future vaccine did not follow the traditional mapping of political attitudes along a Left-Right axis. The rift seems to be between people who feel close to governing parties (Centre, Left and Right) on the one hand, and, on the other, people who feel close to Far-Left and Far-Right parties as well as people who do not feel close to any party. We draw on the French sociological literature on ordinary attitudes to politics to discuss our results as well as the cultural pathways via which political beliefs can affect perceptions of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic."

5956,Early Safety Monitoring of COVID-19 Vaccines in Healthcare Workers.,"Hospital-based surveillance for adverse events was conducted on healthcare workers after they received the first dose of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Among the two new platform vaccines (messenger RNA- and adenoviral vector-based vaccines), the rates of systemic adverse events were significantly higher among adenovirus-vectored vaccine recipients. Fatigue (87.6% vs. 53.8%), myalgia (80.8% vs. 50.0%), headache (72.0% vs. 28.8%), and fever (≥ 38.0°C, 38.7% vs. 0%) were the most common adverse events among adenovirus-vectored vaccine recipients, but most symptoms resolved within 2 days. Both types of COVID-19 vaccines were generally safe, and serious adverse events rarely occurred."

5958,Risk factors for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in patients with common cold symptoms in a primary care setting - a retrospective analysis based on a joint documentation standard.,"Background: Combating the COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for health systems, citizens and policy makers worldwide. Early detection of affected patients within the large and heterogeneous group of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort, but often hindered by limited testing resources, false-negative test results and the lack of pathognomonic symptoms in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to identify anamnestic items with an increased/decreased odds ratio for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (CovPCR) result in a primary care setting. Methods: We performed a multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive clinical characteristics for a positive CovPCR over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. Results: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received CovPCR and were included in this analysis. The median age was 44.0 (IQR: 31.0-59.0) and a fraction of 10.7% (n = 40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51-13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11-0.97). Furthermore, patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.72-15.51). This correlation was also present when they themselves were still asymptomatic (OR: 12.55; 95% CI: 3.97-39.67). Conclusions: Several anamnestic criteria may be helpful to assess pre-test probability of COVID-19 in patients with common cold symptoms."
