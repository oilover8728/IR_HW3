2552,COVID-19 in children: analysis of the first pandemic peak in England.,"Objectives: To assess disease trends, testing practices, community surveillance, case-fatality and excess deaths in children as compared with adults during the first pandemic peak in England. Setting: England. Participants: Children with COVID-19 between January and May 2020. Main outcome measures: Trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity rates in children compared with adults; community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) compared with adults, case-fatality rate in children with confirmed COVID-19 and excess childhood deaths compared with the previous 5 years. Results: Children represented 1.1% (1,408/129,704) of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases between 16 January 2020 and 3 May 2020. In total, 540 305 people were tested for SARS-COV-2 and 129,704 (24.0%) were positive. In children aged <16 years, 35,200 tests were performed and 1408 (4.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, compared to 19.1%-34.9% adults. Childhood cases increased from mid-March and peaked on 11 April before declining. Among 2,961 individuals presenting with ARI in primary care, 351 were children and 10 (2.8%) were positive compared with 9.3%-45.5% in adults. Eight children died and four (case-fatality rate, 0.3%; 95% CI 0.07% to 0.7%) were due to COVID-19. We found no evidence of excess mortality in children. Conclusions: Children accounted for a very small proportion of confirmed cases despite the large numbers of children tested. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was low even in children with ARI. Our findings provide further evidence against the role of children in infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2."

2554,A Saliva-Based RNA Extraction-Free Workflow Integrated With Cas13a for SARS-CoV-2 Detection.,"A major bottleneck in scaling-up COVID-19 testing is the need for sophisticated instruments and well-trained healthcare professionals, which are already overwhelmed due to the pandemic. Moreover, the high-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics are contingent on an RNA extraction step, which, in turn, is restricted by constraints in the supply chain. Here, we present CASSPIT (Cas13 Assisted Saliva-based & Smartphone Integrated Testing), which will allow direct use of saliva samples without the need for an extra RNA extraction step for SARS-CoV-2 detection. CASSPIT utilizes CRISPR-Cas13a based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, and lateral-flow assay (LFA) readout of the test results. The sample preparation workflow includes an optimized chemical treatment and heat inactivation method, which, when applied to COVID-19 clinical samples, showed a 97% positive agreement with the RNA extraction method. With CASSPIT, LFA based visual limit of detection (LoD) for a given SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked into the saliva samples was ~200 copies; image analysis-based quantification further improved the analytical sensitivity to ~100 copies. Upon validation of clinical sensitivity on RNA extraction-free saliva samples (n = 76), a 98% agreement between the lateral-flow readout and RT-qPCR data was found (Ct<35). To enable user-friendly test results with provision for data storage and online consultation, we subsequently integrated lateral-flow strips with a smartphone application. We believe CASSPIT will eliminate our reliance on RT-qPCR by providing comparable sensitivity and will be a step toward establishing nucleic acid-based point-of-care (POC) testing for COVID-19."
2555,Second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine: Value of timely administration but questionable necessity among the seropositive.,"This study monitored titers of neutralizing IgG against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit 14 days post-injection of each dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in 401 Greek healthcare workers aged 20-67. After the first dose, titers varied upon age and history of infection, being lower in the 50+ age group and significantly higher among the seropositive. After the second dose, immunogenicity was significantly boosted in the age 50+ and SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals, indicating the effectuality of its timely administration, yet questioning its value among the seropositive."

2557,"Preliminary report of an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in mink and mink farmers associated with community spread, Denmark, June to November 2020.","In June-November 2020, SARS-CoV-2-infected mink were detected in 290 of 1,147 Danish mink farms. In North Denmark Region, 30% (324/1,092) of people found connected to mink farms tested SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive and approximately 27% (95% confidence interval (CI): 25-30) of SARS-CoV-2-strains from humans in the community were mink-associated. Measures proved insufficient to mitigate spread. On 4 November, the government ordered culling of all Danish mink. Farmed mink constitute a potential virus reservoir challenging pandemic control."
2558,Loop-mediated isothermal amplification for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva.,"In the fight against the recent COVID-19 pandemics, testing is crucial. Nasopharyngeal swabs and real-time RT-PCR are used for the detection of the viral RNA. The collection of saliva is non-invasive, pain-free and does not require trained personnel. An alternative to RT-PCR is loop-mediated isothermal amplification coupled with reverse transcription (RT-LAMP) that is easy to perform, quick and does not require a thermal cycler. The aim of this study was to test whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected directly in saliva using RT-LAMP. We have tested 16 primer mixes from the available literature in three rounds of sensitivity assays. The selected RT-LAMP primer mix has a limit of detection of 6 copies of viral RNA per reaction in comparison with RT-PCR with 1 copy per reaction. Whole saliva, as well as saliva collected using Salivette collection tubes, interfered with the RT-LAMP analysis. Neither Chelex-100 nor protease treatment of saliva prevented the inhibitory effect of saliva. With the addition of the ribonuclease inhibitor, the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was 12 copies per reaction of RNA in Salivette® saliva samples and 6 copies per reaction of RNA in whole saliva samples. This study shows that it is possible to combine the use of saliva and RT-LAMP for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection without RNA extraction which was confirmed on a small set of correctly diagnosed clinical samples. Further studies should prove whether this protocol is suitable for point of care testing in the clinical setting."
2559,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2: a new paradigm of COVID-19 management.,"Full attention must be given to the follow-up of patients recovered from Coronavirus disease 2019, which developed in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Among the most serious issues since the emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 has been whether those who had it can experience a second episode of infection and what that implies for immunity. The earlier studies on COVID-19 disease focused primarily on the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of patients with CO-VID-19. However, conclusions of these studies still require to be warranted by more careful design, larger sample size and statistically well structured studies. COVID-19 is an under-studied infection, and several aspects of viral transmission and clinical progress remain at present unclear. There is a concern about the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces and in the respiratory system of patients who have survi-ved. One of the most concerning issues since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 is persistence in patients and whether patients can be re-infected. After hospital discharge, recovered patients were reported to have positive SARS-CoV-2 test in China, Japan, and South Korea. In addition to the persistence of the virus, SARS-CoV-2 re-infection may occur in survivors. In this paper, we focused on the evidence of persistence and re-infection of SARS-CoV-2."
