701,Classification under uncertainty: data analysis for diagnostic antibody testing.,"Formulating accurate and robust classification strategies is a key challenge of developing diagnostic and antibody tests. Methods that do not explicitly account for disease prevalence and uncertainty therein can lead to significant classification errors. We present a novel method that leverages optimal decision theory to address this problem. As a preliminary step, we develop an analysis that uses an assumed prevalence and conditional probability models of diagnostic measurement outcomes to define optimal (in the sense of minimizing rates of false positives and false negatives) classification domains. Critically, we demonstrate how this strategy can be generalized to a setting in which the prevalence is unknown by either (i) defining a third class of hold-out samples that require further testing or (ii) using an adaptive algorithm to estimate prevalence prior to defining classification domains. We also provide examples for a recently published SARS-CoV-2 serology test and discuss how measurement uncertainty (e.g. associated with instrumentation) can be incorporated into the analysis. We find that our new strategy decreases classification error by up to a decade relative to more traditional methods based on confidence intervals. Moreover, it establishes a theoretical foundation for generalizing techniques such as receiver operating characteristics by connecting them to the broader field of optimization."
702,SARS-CoV-2 re-infection risk in Austria.,"Background: A key question concerning coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is how effective and long lasting immunity against this disease is in individuals who were previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections in the general population in Austria. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study using national SARS-CoV-2 infection data from the Austrian epidemiological reporting system. As the primary outcome, we aim to compare the odds of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections of COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (February to April 30, 2020) versus the odds of first infections in the remainder general population by tracking polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed infections of both groups during the second wave from September 1 to November 30, 2020. Re-infection counts are tentative, since it cannot be excluded that the positive PCR in the first and/or second wave might have been a false positive. Results: We recorded 40 tentative re-infections in 14 840 COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (0.27%) and 253 581 infections in 8 885 640 individuals of the remaining general population (2.85%) translating into an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.09 (0.07 to 0.13). Conclusions: We observed a relatively low re-infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria. Protection against SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection is comparable with the highest available estimates on vaccine efficacies. Further well-designed research on this issue is urgently needed for improving evidence-based decisions on public health measures and vaccination strategies."
703,A discussion on implementing pooling detection tests of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for a large population.,"A pooled sample analysis strategy for novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)) is proposed for a large population in this paper. The population to be tested is divided into divisions based on earlier observed detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 first. Samples collected are then grouped in appropriate pooled size. The number of tests per person in that population is expressed as a function of two variables: the observed detection rate and the pooled size or number of samples grouped. The minimum number of tests per person can be further shown to be a function of only one of these two variables, because these two parameters are found to be related at this minimum. A management scheme on grouping the samples is proposed in order to reduce the number of tests, to save time, which is of utmost importance in fighting an epidemic. The proposed testing scheme will be useful for supporting the government in making decisions to handle regular routine detection tests for identifying asymptomatic patients and implementing health code system in large population of millions of citizens. Another important point is to use smaller number of test kits, allowing more resources to speed up the mass screening tests, particularly in places not so rich."
704,Clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia treated with corticosteroids and colchicine in Colombia.,"Background: To date, there is no specific antiviral therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Since there is no specific therapy against SARS-CoV2, current efforts aim to prevent contagion through public health measures and develop a protective vaccine. While waiting for the latter, it is necessary to evaluate the drugs that at least, in initial studies, suggested some degree of utility in the management of Covid-19 or its complications. The main objective of the study was to describe the clinical manifestations and outcomes of patients with severe Covid-19 Pneumonia treated with corticosteroids and colchicine. Materials and methods: A cross sectional study of 301 adult patients with Covid-19 Pneumonia confirmed by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction for SARS-CoV2 (RT-PCR SARS-CoV2), Berlin protocol, who required hospitalization in three hospitals in Antioquia, Colombia. Patients were treated according to the institutional protocol (from March 20, 2020 to June 30, 2020) with corticosteroid if the patient required supplemental oxygen. From July 1, 2020, the management protocol changed with the addition of colchicine to all patients admitted to the institutions. The treatment was supervised and monitored by the same specialist in Infectology of the institutions. We describe the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the patients who received these treatments. The information of the patients was analyzed according to the outcome of interest (alive/dead) with univariate, bivariate, and multivariate measures to adjust the variables that presented statistical association. Results: All patients had pneumonia documented by chest computed tomography with ground glass images and presented an alveolar pressure/inspired oxygen fraction (PaFi) less than 300. Three hundred one patients were included, 240 (79.7%) received corticosteroids, within these 145 (48.2%) received colchicine also, and the remaining 61 (20.3%) patients did not receive corticosterioids or colchicine. Mortality in the group that received colchicine was lower compared to the group that did not receive it (9.6 vs 14.6%, p-value = 0.179). Conclusions: Treatment with corticosteroids and colchicine for managing patients with severe Covid-19 Pneumonia was associated with low mortality at the hospital level. Randomized, placebo-controlled studies are required to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids and colchicine on complications or death from Covid-19."
705,A simple method for detection of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) using one-step RT-PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism.,"A novel coronavirus associated with acute respiratory disease (named SARS-CoV-2) is recently identified in Wuhan city, China, spread rapidly worldwide. Early identification of this novel coronavirus by molecular tools is critical for surveillance and control of the epidemic outbreak. We aimed to establish a simple method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in differentiating with SARS-CoV. Primers of our in-house reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were designed to target conserved regions of the RdRP gene and E gene, selected restriction enzymes EcoRI, Tsp45I, and AluI to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. In this report, a 396-bp fragment of the RdRp gene and 345-bp fragment of the E gene were amplified by one-step RT-PCR. Enzyme Tsp45I cuts the RdRP-amplified product of SARS-CoV-2 generating three fragments of 45, 154, and 197 bp, but it did not cut the amplicon of SARS-CoV. In contrast, the amplified product of SARS-CoV was digested with EcoRI producing two fragments of 76 and 320 bp, whereas the amplicon of SARS-CoV-2 was undigested by Tsp45I help to distinguish clearly SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV on gel electrophoresis. In addition, AluI cut the amplicon of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 generating two fragments of 248 and 97 bp without cutting to SARS-CoV. The accuracy of the assay was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. When evaluated on clinical samples showed a high sensitivity of 95%, specificity of our assay was 100% and clinical performance for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other reference assays. In conclusion, in the present study, we successfully developed a simple method for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in differentiating with SARS-CoV."
706,Testing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy through deliberate natural viral exposure.,"Background: A vaccine trial with a conventional challenge design can be very fast once it starts, but it requires a long prior process, in part to grow and standardize challenge virus in the laboratory. This detracts somewhat from its overall promise for accelerated efficacy testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidates, and from the ability of developing countries and small companies to conduct it. Aims: We set out to identify a challenge design that avoids this part of the long prior process. Sources: Literature in trial design (including a proof of concept flu challenge trial by B. Killingley et al.), vaccinology, medical ethics, and various aspects of COVID response. Content: A challenge design with deliberate natural viral exposure avoids the need to grow culture. This new design is described and compared both to a conventional challenge design and to a conventional phase III field trial. In comparison, the proposed design has ethical, scientific, and feasibility strengths. Implications: The proposed new design should be considered for future vaccine trials."
707,SARS-CoV-2 is associated with high viral loads in asymptomatic and recently symptomatic healthcare workers.,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from both patients and other HCW with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of SARS-CoV-2 ≤ 34 and the first 7-9 days of symptoms are associated with enhanced infectivity. We determined Ct values and duration of symptoms of HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. As HCW often assume their greatest risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 is working on a COVID-19 unit, we also determined Ct values and symptom duration of inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Methods: From 6/24/2020-8/23/2020, Ct values and duration of symptoms from 13 HCW, 12 outpatients, and 28 inpatients who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. Results: Among HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 46.2% (6/13) were asymptomatic and requested testing due to an exposure to someone with COVID-19; 83.3% (5/6) of those exposures occurred in the community rather than in the hospital. The median Ct value of HCW was 23.2, and 84.6% (11/13) had a Ct value ≤ 34. The median Ct value of 29.0 among outpatients with COVID-19 did not significantly differ from HCW. In contrast, inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test had a median Ct value of 34.0 (p = 0.003), which translated into a median ~1,000-fold lower viral load than observed in HCW. Among those with symptoms related to COVID-19, no (0/6) HCW compared to 50% (6/12) of inpatients had symptoms for at least one week (p = 0.04). Conclusions: At our institution, asymptomatic COVID-19 accounted for nearly half of the cases among HCW. Symptomatic HCW had high viral loads and short duration of symptoms, both of which are associated with peak infectivity. Infection prevention programs should educate HCW on these findings in an effort to increase adherence to the requirement to maintain six feet separation in workspaces and breakrooms, in addition to consistently wearing personal protection equipment."
708,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in dried blood spots.,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to development of numerous serologic tests. To obviate the need for phlebotomy services, we validated dried blood spots (DBS) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. Immunoglobulins were extracted from 3 mm DBS punches and the extracts were analyzed using the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA. Various pre-analytical factors were studied. Results were favorable for DBS stored for at least 67 days at or below 37°C. Comparison between paired serum and DBS specimens tested by the Euroimmun ELISA showed 96.8% and 81.3% positive and negative agreement, respectively, indicating that confirmatory testing of positive Euroimmun results on DBS extracts is necessary to achieve clinical accuracy. Our findings suggest that any SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay that requires pre-dilution of serum is amenable to DBS as an alternate specimen type that is relatively low cost, self-collectable, stable, can be shipped by standard mail and could be used to establish the seroprevalence of large populations."
709,Dacron swab and PBS are acceptable alternatives to flocked swab and viral transport media for SARS-CoV-2.,"Nasopharyngeal flocked swabs placed in viral transport media (VTM) are the preferred collection methodology for respiratory virus testing. Due to the rapid depletion of available reagents and swabs, we have validated an alternative swab placed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for use in respiratory virus testing in a SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and a multiplexed respiratory virus panel. We collected nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from 10 healthy volunteers. Flocked swabs were placed in VTM and alternative swabs in PBS. In this feasibility study, we show that NP collection is better for detection of human material than OP collection, as measured by significantly lower RNase P gene cycle threshold values, and that a Dacron polyester swab in PBS shows equivalent detection of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV to a flocked swab in VTM in contrived specimens. Diluted SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens are detectable for up to 72 h at 4 °C."
