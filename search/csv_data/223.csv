2220,COVID-19: Black Swan or clumsy use?,"""Black Swan"" is an unexpected and catastrophic event characterized by three conditions: the anomalous and exceptional value, the extreme impact, and predictability a posteriori. On many sides - by politicians, commentators, scientists - there have been attempts to give the COVID-19 pandemic event the meaning of Black Swan. In reality, one should wonder if the Black Swan was not, instead (or even), the way the epidemic was handled. In Italy, an unreasonable use of a two-step protocol - IgM/IgG anti-COVID followed by RT-PCR in the serologically positive only has caused considerable uncertainty, particularly relevant in measures for maintenance or readmission to work of health personnel. This protocol could be affected by serious uncertainties arising from the analytical limitations of the tests used. To quantify this defect, we evaluated the analytical specifications of serological tests under different prevalence conditions. In conclusion, although laboratory diagnostics represent a useful tool, it can only be used for epidemiological purposes and not to provide healthy pass."
2221,SARS-CoV-2 genomic and subgenomic RNAs in diagnostic samples are not an indicator of active replication.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected in late December 2019 and has spread worldwide. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses and employ a complicated pattern of virus genome length RNA replication as well as transcription of genome length and leader containing subgenomic RNAs. Although not fully understood, both replication and transcription are thought to take place in so-called double-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Here we show detection of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNAs in diagnostic samples up to 17 days after initial detection of infection and provide evidence for their nuclease resistance and protection by cellular membranes suggesting that detection of subgenomic RNAs in such samples may not be a suitable indicator of active coronavirus replication/infection."
2222,Animal models for SARS-Cov2/Covid19 research-A commentary.,"There is an urgent need for new animal models of SARS CoV-2 infection to improve research and drug development. This brief commentary examines the deficits of current models and proposes several improved alternates. The existing single transgene mouse models poorly mimic the clinical features of COVID-19; those strains get a milder disease than human COVID-19 disease. Many of the current transgenic models utilize random integration of several copies of single ACE2 transgenes, resulting in unnatural gene expression and exhibit rapid lethality. We suggest preparing precision knock-in of selected human mini genes at the mouse initiation codon and knock-out of the mouse homolog as a better option. Three genes critical for infection are suggested targets, ACE2 (the viral cellular receptor), its co-infection protease TMRPSS2, and the primary antibody clearance receptor FcγRT. To offer the best platform for COVID 19 research, preparation of single, double, and triple humanized combinations offers the researcher the opportunity to better understand the contributions of these receptors, coreceptors to therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we propose to create the humanized strains in the C57BL/6J and BALB/c backgrounds. These two backgrounds are Th1 responders and Th2 responders, respectively, and allow modeling of the variability seen in human pathology including lung pathology and late sequelae of COVID-19 disease (BALB/c). We suggest the need to do a thorough characterization of both the short-term and long-term effects of SAR-CoV-2 infection at the clinical, virologic, histopathologic, hematologic, and immunologic levels. We expect the multiply humanized strains will be superior to the single-gene and multiple-gene-copy transgenic models available to date. These mouse models will represent state-of-the-art tools for investigating mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunity and developing vaccines and drugs."
2223,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mortality of the elderly patient with a hip fracture.,"COVID-19 became a threat to the public health system, compromising the health of the population. Patients with hip fractures, due to their age and comorbidity, were high-risk patients in this pandemic. The purpose of this study was to observe how the pandemic affected the management of hip fractures in elderly patients. Methods: This is a descriptive, retrospective study of all patients over the age of 65 diagnosed with a hip fracture that came to the emergency room of Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in the COVID-19 pandemic period, from the 11th of March to the 24th of April 2020. They were followed up during their hospital stay and 30 days after the fracture. Results: A total of 63 patients were included, 18 (28.6%) of whom had a positive RT-qPCR for COVID-19. Four could not be operated on due to the severity of the disease they presented with upon admission, dying a few days afterwards. Three of these patients had COVID-19. The 83.3% of the patients with positive RT-qPCR presented respiratory symptoms during their hospitalization. The length of hospital stays of patients with a positive RT-qPCR (18.25±8.99 days) was longer than that of patients that were RT-qPCR negative (10.9±4.52 days) (P=.01). In-hospital mortality in operated patients was 20% in patients with a positive RT-qPCR, compared with 2.3% in the group of patients who tested negative (P=.018). Mortality at 30 days was 40% in the group with positive RT-qPCR vs 6.8% in patients not infected by SARS-CoV-2 (P=.002). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly patients with hip fractures increases both the length of hospital stay, as well as in-hospital and 30-day mortality."

2226,A Machine Learning Approach as an Aid for Early COVID-19 Detection.,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease COVID-19 has forced us to go into our homes and limit our physical interactions with others. Economies around the world have come to a halt, with non-essential businesses being forced to close in order to prevent further propagation of the virus. Developing countries are having more difficulties due to their lack of access to diagnostic resources. In this study, we present an approach for detecting COVID-19 infections exclusively on the basis of self-reported symptoms. Such an approach is of great interest because it is relatively inexpensive and easy to deploy at either an individual or population scale. Our best model delivers a sensitivity score of 0.752, a specificity score of 0.609, and an area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic of 0.728. These are promising results that justify continuing research efforts towards a machine learning test for detecting COVID-19."
2227,Evaluation of Discomfort in Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen Collection for SARS-CoV-2 Diagnosis.,"Background: The rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide has impo-sed the need to identify a test that quickly recognizes affected subjects, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. The most reliable option has been proven to be the RT-PCR, which allows to detect virus RNA on a specimen from a high viral load site, such as nasopharynx. Nasopha-ryngeal sample collection is possible by means of a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and is a practical and relatively non-invasive technique, but rather bothersome for the recipient. Aim: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the discomfort evoked during NPS. Materials and methods: We surveyed 429 patients receiving NPS before hospitalization or other procedures non related to COVID-19. For each one we noted the discomfort level felt during the swab using a 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain and the total time needed for the procedure to be taken. Sex, age, smoking status and positive history of previous swab have been taken into account. Results: We found that, among the variables, sex had a statistically significant impact on the perceived discomfort of nasal swab, with females experiencing slightly more discomfort. Conclusions: NPS is largely a none-to-minimum discomfort in-ducing procedure. The differences in perceived discomfort could be explained based on anatomical features, and should remark the need for a tailored and anatomy-oriented approach in each patient."
