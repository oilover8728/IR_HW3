1352,Age-specific mortality and immunity patterns of SARS-CoV-2.,"Estimating the size of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the infection severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is made challenging by inconsistencies in the available data. The number of deaths associated with COVID-19 is often used as a key indicator for the size of the epidemic, but the observed number of deaths represents only a minority of all infections1,2. In addition, the heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes and the variable reporting of deaths of older individuals can hinder direct comparisons of mortality rates and the underlying levels of transmission across countries3. Here we use age-specific COVID-19-associated death data from 45 countries and the results of 22 seroprevalence studies to investigate the consistency of infection and fatality patterns across multiple countries. We find that the age distribution of deaths in younger age groups (less than 65 years of age) is very consistent across different settings and demonstrate how these data can provide robust estimates of the share of the population that has been infected. We estimate that the infection fatality ratio is lowest among 5-9-year-old children, with a log-linear increase by age among individuals older than 30 years. Population age structures and heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the heterogeneity between countries in infection fatality ratios. Among the 45 countries included in our analysis, we estimate that approximately 5% of these populations had been infected by 1 September 2020, and that much higher transmission rates have probably occurred in a number of Latin American countries. This simple modelling framework can help countries to assess the progression of the pandemic and can be applied in any scenario for which reliable age-specific death data are available."
1353,COVID-19 infection in the palatine tonsil tissue and detritus: the detection of the virus compartment with RT-PCR.,"Two patients suffering from chronic recurrent tonsillitis were reported. The first patient was confirmed infected with COVID-19, 3 weeks prior to tonsillectomy. The detritus and tonsil specimen were further analysed through real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and revealed amplification of the fragment N and ORF1ab genes of SARS-CoV-2. The second patient had a negative IgM and positive IgG antibody for COVID-19; however, the nasopharyngeal swab indicated negative for SARS-CoV-2. Tonsillectomy was performed 2 weeks after the swab; the tonsil specimen was analysed through RT-PCR and revealed amplification of the N2 and RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. According to both results, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 gene remains to be detected in tonsil and/or detritus after 2-3 weeks after recovery. Hence, it is suggested that it is necessary to use adequate protection when performing tonsillectomy on early recovered patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, tonsillectomy would be more advisable to be performed after the fourth week after recovery from COVID-19."
1354,Comparing Results of Five SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Assays Before and After the First Dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine among Health Care Workers.,"Reliable results regarding serologic positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody before and after AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccination are essential for estimating the efficacy of vaccination. We assessed positivity rates and associated factors using five SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. A total of 228 paired serum samples (456 samples) were obtained from 228 participants. After baseline sampling, the second sampling was conducted between 11 and 28 days after the first dose of the AZ vaccine. Sera were tested using five SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, including two surrogate virus neutralization tests. A questionnaire on the symptoms, severity, and duration of adverse reactions was completed by all participants. The overall positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 antibody were 84.6% for the Roche assay, 92.5% for the Abbott assay, 75.4% for the Siemens assay, 90.7% for the SD Biosensor assay, and 66.2% for the GenScript assay after the first dose of the AZ vaccine. The positivity rates and antibody titers of sera obtained between 21 and 28 days were significantly higher than those obtained between 11 and 20 days in all five assays. More-severe adverse reactions and longer durations of adverse reactions were related to higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. The agreements and correlations among the assays applied were substantial (к, 0.73 to 0.95) and strong (ρ, 0.83 to 0.91). A single dose of the AZ vaccine led to high positivity rates based on the five assays. Days after vaccination and adverse reactions could help estimate serologic conversion rates. The results should be interpreted cautiously considering the assays and cutoffs applied. Our findings could inform decisions regarding vaccination and laboratory settings and could thus contribute to the control of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection."

1356,Current and innovative methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (Review).,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‑19) pandemic has forced the scientific community to rapidly develop highly reliable diagnostic methods in order to effectively and accurately diagnose this pathology, thus limiting the spread of infection. Although the structural and molecular characteristics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) were initially unknown, various diagnostic strategies useful for making a correct diagnosis of COVID‑19 have been rapidly developed by private research laboratories and biomedical companies. At present, rapid antigen or antibody tests, immunoenzymatic serological tests and molecular tests based on RT‑PCR are the most widely used and validated techniques worldwide. Apart from these conventional methods, other techniques, including isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques, clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas (CRISPR/Cas)‑based approaches or digital PCR methods are currently used in research contexts or are awaiting approval for diagnostic use by competent authorities. In order to provide guidance for the correct use of COVID‑19 diagnostic tests, the present review describes the diagnostic strategies available which may be used for the diagnosis of COVID‑19 infection in both clinical and research settings. In particular, the technical and instrumental characteristics of the diagnostic methods used are described herein. In addition, updated and detailed information about the type of sample, the modality and the timing of use of specific tests are also discussed."
1357,"The experience of the health care workers of a severely hit SARS-CoV-2 referral Hospital in Italy: incidence, clinical course and modifiable risk factors for COVID-19 infection.","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the health care workers (HCWs) at the frontline have been largely exposed to infected patients, running a high risk of being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Since limiting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in health care setting is crucial to avoid the community spread of SARS-CoV-2, we want to share our experience as an early hit hospital where standard infection control practices have been conscientiously applied and effective. We believe that our example, as first and hardest hit country, might be a warning and aid not only for those who have been hit later, but also for a second fearful wave of contagion. In addition, we want to offer an insight on modifiable risk factors for HWs-related infection. Methods: Demographic, lifestyle, work-related and comorbidities data of 1447 HCWs, which underwent a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, were retrospectively collected. For the 164 HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2, data about safety in the workplace, symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 were also collected. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed using a multivariable Poisson regression. Results: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the screened HCWs was 11.33% (9.72-13.21). Working in a COVID-19 ward, being a former smoker (versus being a person who never smoked) and BMI was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas being a current smoker was negatively associated with this variable. Conclusions: Assuming an equal accessibility and proper use of personal protective equipment of all the HCWs of our Hospital, the great and more prolonged contact with COVID-19 patients remains the crucial risk factor for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, increased and particular care needs to be focused specifically on the most exposed HCWs groups, which should be safeguarded. Furthermore, in order to limit the risk of asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the HCWs mild symptoms of COVID-19 should be considered when evaluating the potential benefits of universal staff testing."
1358,"COVID-19: Vaccine Delivery System, Drug Repurposing and Application of Molecular Modeling Approach.","The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread across the world, resulting in a pandemic COVID-19 which is a human zoonotic disease that is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) strain thought to have originated in wild or captive bats in the initial COVID outbreak region. The global COVID-19 outbreak started in Guangdong Province, China's southernmost province. The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the sheer number of infected people, many of whom need intensive care before succumbing to the disease. The epidemic is being handled by a combination of disease control by public health interventions and compassionate treatment for those who have been impacted. There is no clear anti-COVID-19 medication available at this time. However, the need to find medications that can turn the tide has led to the development of a number of investigational drugs as potential candidates for improving outcomes, especially in the severely and critically ill. Although many of these adjunctive medications are still being studied in clinical trials, professional organizations have attempted to define the circumstances in which their use is deemed off-label or compassionate. It is important to remind readers that new information about COVID-19's clinical features, treatment options, and outcomes is released on a regular basis. The mainstay of treatment remains optimized supportive care, and the therapeutic effectiveness of the subsequent agents is still being studied."
1359,"Prolonged persistence of PCR-detectable virus during an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in an inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit in King County, Washington.","Background: We describe key characteristics, interventions, and outcomes of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak within an inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit at the University of Washington Medical Center - Northwest. Methods: After identifying 2 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 11, 2020, we conducted an outbreak investigation and employed targeted interventions including: screening of patients and staff; isolation and cohorting of confirmed cases; serial testing; and enhanced infection prevention measures. Results: We identified 10 patients and 7 staff members with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirty percent of patients (n = 3) remained asymptomatic over the course of infection. Among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, fever (n = 5, 50%) and cough (n = 4, 40%) were the most common symptoms. Median duration of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity was 25.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 22.8-41.8) among symptomatic patients and 22.0 days (IQR 19.5-25.5) among asymptomatic patients. Median initial (19.0, IQR 18.7-25.7 vs 21.7, IQR 20.7-25.6) and nadir (18.9, IQR 18.2-20.3 vs 19.8, IQR 17.0-20.7) cycle threshold values were similar across symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively. Conclusions: Asymptomatic infection was common in this cohort of hospitalized, elderly individuals despite similar duration of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity and cycle threshold values among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients."
