3850,Willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19: An exploratory online survey in a Portuguese cohort of multiple sclerosis patients.,"Background: Little is known about MS patients' acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine. Objective and methods: An online survey was conducted among MS patients to study COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and its associated factors. Results and conclusion: Among 256 participants, 80.9% of the patients were either definitely or probably willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Most hesitant patients would consider being vaccinated under physician recommendation. Older patients and those with comorbidities seem to be more willing to get vaccinated. Moreover, vaccine acceptability was associated with participants' convictions and concerns about COVID-19, as well as previous vaccination practices."
3851,Evaluation of serological lateral flow assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2.,"Background: COVID-19 has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lateral flow assays can detect anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to monitor transmission. However, standardized evaluation of their accuracy and tools to aid in interpreting results are needed. Methods: We evaluated 20 IgG and IgM assays selected from available tests in April 2020. We evaluated the assays' performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10-40 days after symptom onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive values based on their accuracy and local prevalence. Results: Combined IgG + IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9 to 94.6%, while combined specificities ranged from 92.6 to 100%. The highest sensitivities were detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined IgG + IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined IgG + IgM specificity. Lumiquick had the lowest estimated limit-of-detection (LOD) (0.1 μg/mL), followed by a similar LOD of 1.5 μg/mL for CareHealth, Cellex, KHB, and Vivachek. Conclusion: We provide a public resource of the accuracy of select lateral flow assays with potential for home testing. The cost-effectiveness, scalable manufacturing process, and suitability for self-testing makes LFAs an attractive option for monitoring disease prevalence and assessing vaccine responsiveness. Our web tool provides an easy-to-use interface to demonstrate the impact of prevalence and test accuracy on the positive predictive values."
3852,"COVID-19 pneumonia: computer-aided quantification of healthy lung parenchyma, emphysema, ground glass and consolidation on chest computed tomography (CT).","Objective: To calculate by means of a computer-aided tool the volumes of healthy residual lung parenchyma, of emphysema, of ground glass opacity (GGO) and of consolidation on chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with suspected viral pneumonia by COVID-19. Materials and methods: This study included 116 patients that for suspected COVID-19 infection were subjected to the reverse transcription real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. A computer-aided tool was used to calculate on chest CT images healthy residual lung parenchyma, emphysema, GGO and consolidation volumes for both right and left lung. Expert radiologists, in consensus, assessed the CT images using a structured report and attributed a radiological severity score at the disease pulmonary involvement using a scale of five levels. Nonparametric test was performed to assess differences statistically significant among groups. Results: GGO was the most represented feature in suspected CT by COVID-19 infection; it is present in 102/109 (93.6%) patients with a volume percentage value of 19.50% and a median value of 0.64 L, while the emphysema and consolidation volumes were low (0.01 L and 0.03 L, respectively). Among quantified volume, only GGO volume had a difference statistically significant between the group of patients with suspected versus non-suspected CT for COVID-19 (p < < 0.01). There were differences statistically significant among the groups based on radiological severity score in terms of healthy residual parenchyma volume, of GGO volume and of consolidations volume (p < < 0.001). Conclusion: We demonstrated that, using a computer-aided tool, the COVID-19 pneumonia was mirrored with a percentage median value of GGO of 19.50% and that only GGO volume had a difference significant between the patients with suspected or non-suspected CT for COVID-19 infection."
3853,Provisional recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis.,"People with cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis (CV) have an increased risk of infections, attributed to different causes: impairment of the immune system due to the disease itself, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, these patients may be at high risk for a more severe course of COVID-19, including hospitalisation and death. Concerns about efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of vaccines, as well as doubts, not yet fully clarified in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, represent other important factors for a low vaccination rate in people with (CV). Indeed, providing an expert position on the issues related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients suffering from CV is of critical relevance in order to help both patients and clinicians who are treating them in making the best choice in each case. A multidisciplinary task force of the Italian Group for the Study of Cryoglobulinaemia (GISC) was convened, and through a Delphi technique produced provisional recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cryoglobulinaemic patients."
3854,COVID-19 pandemic: A review based on current evidence.,"In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, a novel coronavirus, initiated an outbreak of pneumonia from Wuhan in China, which rapidly spread worldwide. The clinical characteristics of the disease range from asymptomatic cases or mild symptoms, which include nonspecific symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, headache, and nasal congestion to severe cases such as pneumonia, respiratory failure demanding mechanical ventilation to multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death. As the transmission rate is quite alarming, we require an effective therapeutic strategy to treat symptomatic patients and adopt the preventive measures in order to contain the infection and prevent community transmission. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern, hence repurposing of the drugs is an attractive and a feasible option because PK/PD profile, toxicity profile, and drug interactions are already known. This review emphasizes on the different aspects of COVID-19 such as the epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and preventive measures to be adopted in order to fight this pandemic. It also highlights upon the ethics preparedness and challenges faced by a developing country like India during such an outbreak. The review focuses on the various approaches adopted till date for developing effective therapeutic strategies including combination of drugs, vaccine therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy to combat this viral outbreak."
3855,Testing COVID-19 tests faces methodological challenges.,"In battling the COVID-19 pandemic, testing is essential. The detection of viral RNA allows the identification of infected persons, whereas the detection of antibodies may reveal a response to a previous infection. Tests for coronavirus should be rigorously evaluated in terms of their analytical and clinical performance. This poses not only logistic challenges, but also methodological ones. Some of these are generic for the diagnostic accuracy paradigm, whereas others are more specific for tests for viruses. Problematic for evaluations of the clinical performance of tests for viral RNA is the absence of an independent reference standard. Many studies lack rigor in terms of the recruitment of study participants. Study reports are often insufficiently informative, which makes it difficult to assess the applicability of study findings. Attempts to summarize the performance of these tests in terms of a single estimate of the clinical sensitivity fail to do justice to the identifiable sources of the large heterogeneity in mechanisms for generating false negative results."
3856,Adherence to Immunization: Rebuttal of Vaccine Hesitancy.,"Immunizations have been saving the lives of millions of people since they were first used by Edward Jenner in 1796, and new vaccines are being developed all the time. Hopefully, a new vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be developed in the near future, and perhaps even one for human immunodeficiency virus. Although the effectiveness of vaccinations has been proven over the years and adverse effects to currently available vaccinations are extremely rare, many people continue to defer immunizations for themselves and their families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this phenomenon, known as ""vaccine hesitancy,"" is a major public health problem globally. This review summarizes the unproven adverse effects of various vaccines and stresses the importance of enforcing vaccination policies to minimize vaccine hesitancy. Every effort should be made to improve existing vaccines and to produce new ones, according to carefully designed scientific preclinical and clinical trials. This is particularly important in today's era, in light of the global transparency regarding vaccination development, and the potential for future pandemics such as COVID-19."
3857,Rapid One-Pot Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Based on a Lateral Flow Assay in Clinical Samples.,"Rapid tests for pathogen identification and spread assessment are critical for infectious disease control and prevention. The control of viral outbreaks requires a nucleic acid diagnostic test that is sensitive and simple and delivers fast and reliable results. Here, we report a one-pot direct reverse transcript loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay of SARS-CoV-2 based on a lateral flow assay in clinical samples. The entire contiguous sample-to-answer workflow takes less than 40 min from a clinical swab sample to a diagnostic result without professional instruments and technicians. The assay achieved an accuracy of 100% in 12 synthetic and 12 clinical samples compared to the data from PCR-based assays. We anticipate that our method will provide a universal platform for rapid and point-of-care detection of emerging infectious diseases."
3858,Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) co-infection with HIV: clinical case series analysis in North Central Nigeria.,"SARS-CoV-2 has created a global public health emergency with significant mortality and morbidity for people living with HIV (PLWH). Preliminary data reveals persons with immune-compromised status are at risk of developing adverse clinical outcomes from SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to characterise clinical outcomes of HIV patients co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Nasarawa State, North Central Nigeria. We followed four (4) hospitalised HIV patients that tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 in Nasarawa State and characterised their laboratory findings and clinical outcomes. The consent of the cases was sought and they agreed that their clinical data be published. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were performed using nasopharyngeal swabs (novel coronavirus PCR fluorescence diagnostic kit, BioGerm medical biotechnology) at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Abuja, Nigeria. Our study reveals mild clinical outcome among HIV patients with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. There is need for a syndemic framework to be used to conceptualise SARS-CoV-2 impact among HIV patients and an urgent need to strengthen healthcare programmes within Nigeria."
