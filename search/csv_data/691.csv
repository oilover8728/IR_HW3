6900,"Autophagy/virophagy: a ""disposal strategy"" to combat COVID-19.","Given the devastating consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on all of us, the question arises as to whether manipulating the cellular degradation (recycling, waste disposal) mechanism known as macroautophagy/autophagy (in particular, the selective degradation of virus particles, termed virophagy) might be a beneficial approach to fight the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Knowing that ""autophagy can reprocess everything"", it seems almost inevitable that, sooner rather than later, a further hypothesis-driven work will detail the role of virophagy as a fundamental ""disposal strategy"" against COVID-19, yielding most needed therapeutic interventions. Abbreviations: ATG, autophagy-related; CoV/CoVs coronavirus/coronaviruses; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2."
6901,Antibodies at work in the time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.,"In view of devastating effects of COVID-19 on human life, there is an urgent need for the licened vaccines or therapeutics for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age-old passive immunization with protective antibodies to neutralize the virus is one of the strategies for emergency prophylaxis and therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, the authors discuss up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defense to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been established, with encouraging results. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor have been found to be very promising as a countermeasure for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical trials are underway. Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious, even in people with underlying conditions, will be a significant breakthrough. In addition, emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are promising avenues for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors also discuss the implication of mAbs as mediators of cytokine storm syndrome to modify the immune response of COVID-19 patients, thus reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection."
6902,"Social Determinants Predict Outcomes in Data From a Multi-Ethnic Cohort of 20,899 Patients Investigated for COVID-19.","Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic exploits existing inequalities in social determinants of health (SDOH) in disease burden and access to healthcare. Few studies have examined these emerging disparities using indicators of SDOH. Objective: To evaluate predictors of COVID-19 test positivity, morbidity, and mortality and their implications for inequalities in SDOH and for future policies and health care improvements. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross sectional analysis was performed on all patients tested for COVID-19 on the basis of symptoms with either a history of travel to at risk regions or close contact with a confirmed case, across the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) up until April 26th 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was death from COVID-19 and secondary outcomes were test positivity, and morbidity (e.g., hospitalization and intubation caused by COVID-19). Results: Of 20,899 tested patients, 8,928 tested positive, 1,701 were hospitalized, 684 were intubated, and 1,179 died from COVID-19. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, New York City borough (derived from first 3 digits of zip-code), and English as preferred language were significant predictors of test positivity, hospitalization, intubation and COVID-19 mortality following multivariable logistic regression analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: People residing in poorer boroughs were more likely to be burdened by and die from COVID-19. Our results highlight the importance of integrating comprehensive SDOH data into healthcare efforts with at-risk patient populations."
6903,Prolonged viral shedding in a lymphoma patient with COVID-19 infection receiving convalescent plasma.,"Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first identified in Wuhan, China; and spread all over the world. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 usually returns to negative in 20 days post-infection, but prolonged positivity has been reported up to 63 days. A case whose viral shedding lasted 60 days is reported from China. Herein we report a patient with a history of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for lymphoma whose RT-PCR test remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 74 days. The prolonged RT-PCR positivity, despite convalescent plasma infusion, may suggest that the given antibodies may be ineffective in terms of viral clearance. In patients with hematological malignancies or immunosuppression, such as ASCT, may lead to prolonged viral shedding, and strict isolation is warranted for long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection control."
6904,Impact of COVID-19 on Cardiovascular Testing in the United States Versus the Rest of the World.,"Objectives: This study sought to quantify and compare the decline in volumes of cardiovascular procedures between the United States and non-U.S. institutions during the early phase of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the care of many non-COVID-19 illnesses. Reductions in diagnostic cardiovascular testing around the world have led to concerns over the implications of reduced testing for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Methods: Data were submitted to the INCAPS-COVID (International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Invasive Cardiology Protocols Study of COVID-19), a multinational registry comprising 909 institutions in 108 countries (including 155 facilities in 40 U.S. states), assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on volumes of diagnostic cardiovascular procedures. Data were obtained for April 2020 and compared with volumes of baseline procedures from March 2019. We compared laboratory characteristics, practices, and procedure volumes between U.S. and non-U.S. facilities and between U.S. geographic regions and identified factors associated with volume reduction in the United States. Results: Reductions in the volumes of procedures in the United States were similar to those in non-U.S. facilities (68% vs. 63%, respectively; p = 0.237), although U.S. facilities reported greater reductions in invasive coronary angiography (69% vs. 53%, respectively; p < 0.001). Significantly more U.S. facilities reported increased use of telehealth and patient screening measures than non-U.S. facilities, such as temperature checks, symptom screenings, and COVID-19 testing. Reductions in volumes of procedures differed between U.S. regions, with larger declines observed in the Northeast (76%) and Midwest (74%) than in the South (62%) and West (44%). Prevalence of COVID-19, staff redeployments, outpatient centers, and urban centers were associated with greater reductions in volume in U.S. facilities in a multivariable analysis. Conclusions: We observed marked reductions in U.S. cardiovascular testing in the early phase of the pandemic and significant variability between U.S. regions. The association between reductions of volumes and COVID-19 prevalence in the United States highlighted the need for proactive efforts to maintain access to cardiovascular testing in areas most affected by outbreaks of COVID-19 infection."
6905,Electronic reporting of diagnostic laboratory test results from all healthcare sectors is a cornerstone of national preparedness and control of COVID-19 in Denmark.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented demand for real-time surveillance data in order to inform critical decision makers regarding the management of the pandemic. The aim of this review was to describe how the Danish national microbiology database, MiBa, served as a cornerstone for providing data to the real-time surveillance system by linkage to other nationwide health registries. The surveillance system was established on an existing IT health infrastructure and a close network between clinical microbiologists, information technology experts, and public health officials. In 2020, testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 was ramped up from none to over 10,000 weekly PCR tests per 100,000 population. The crude incidence data mirrored this increase in testing. Real-time access to denominator data and patient registries enabled adjustments for fluctuations testing activity, providing robust data on crude SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the changing diagnostic and management strategies. The use of the same data for different purposes, for example, final laboratory reports, information to the public, contact tracing, public health, and science, has been a critical asset for the pandemic response. It has also raised issues concerning data protection and critical capacity of the underlying technical systems and key resources. However, even with these limitations, the setup has enabled decision makers to adopt timely interventions. The experiences from COVID-19 may motivate a transformation from traditional indicator-based public health surveillance to an all-encompassing information system based on access to a comprehensive set of data sources, including diagnostic and reference microbiology."
6906,Anthropogenic Infection of Cats during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic.,"COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a new coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV-2, which is closely related to SARS-CoV that jumped the animal-human species barrier and caused a disease outbreak in 2003. SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that was first described in 2019, unrelated to the commonly occurring feline coronavirus (FCoV) that is an alphacoronavirus associated with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has spread globally within a few months, resulting in the current pandemic. Felids have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly in the Western world, many people live in very close contact with their pet cats, and natural infections of cats in COVID-19-positive households have been described in several countries. In this review, the European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD), a scientifically independent board of experts in feline medicine from 11 European Countries, discusses the current status of SARS-CoV infections in cats. The review examines the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and human-to-animal transmissions, including infections in domestic and non-domestic felids, as well as mink-to-human/-cat transmission. It summarises current data on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in domestic cats and the results of experimental infections of cats and provides expert opinions on the clinical relevance and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats."
6907,Chest computed tomography findings in different phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Objective: To compare the findings on chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with COVID-19 during different phases of the disease and to evaluate the reproducibility of a visual radiologic score for estimating the extent of lung involvement. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed chest CT studies from 182 patients with RT-PCR findings positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were classified according to the time elapsed from the onset of symptoms, as follows: early (0-4 days), intermediate/progressive (5-9 days), or advanced (≥10 days). We analyzed the frequency of each radiologic finding, as well as the pattern, appearance, and predominant distribution of lung involvement. A visual tomographic score (range, 0-25) was used to estimate the extent of involvement in each lobe and in the total lung volume. Results: The predominant CT finding was the ground-glass pattern (n=110; 60.4%), the most common distribution was peripheral (n = 116; 66.7%), and the most prevalent appearance was typical (n=112; 61.5%). The halo sign was seen most frequently in the early phase (25%), whereas ground-glass opacities were more common in the intermediate/progressive and advanced phases. The median severity score was 10 (IQR: 5-13), and the scores increased as the disease progressed. The interobserver agreement (kappa) was 0.92 for the appearance, 0.84 for the distribution, 0.70 for the predominant pattern, and 0.89 for the visual score. Conclusion: The CT findings in patients with COVID-19 vary with the course of the infection. The proposed visual radiologic score is a simple, reproducible, and reliable tool for assessing lung involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia."
6908,Mass Spectrometry for COVID-19.,"In the United States, response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has been hampered by inadequate testing resources for the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. In the early part of the pandemic, United States laboratories were initially heavily regulated and slow to provide testing. As the pandemic has progressed, the supply chain for instruments and reagents has been inconsistent and has revealed weaknesses in traditional sophisticated infectious disease testing. Testing capabilities of clinical laboratories could be substantially improved by assays that are more simplified and do not require multiple consumable reagents for extraction, purification, amplification and detection. One such technology with the potential to require minimal reagents is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization combined with mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Recently, Nachtigall and colleagues reported the development of a MALDI-MS method for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (1)."
6909,National COVID-19 vaccination plan: using artificial spatial intelligence to overcome challenges in Brazil.,"This article explores the use of spatial artificial intelligence to estimate the resources needed to implement Brazil's COVID-19 immu nization campaign. Using secondary data, we conducted a cross-sectional ecological study adop ting a time-series design. The unit of analysis was Brazil's primary care centers (PCCs). A four-step analysis was performed to estimate the popula tion in PCC catchment areas using artificial in telligence algorithms and satellite imagery. We also assessed internet access in each PCC and con ducted a space-time cluster analysis of trends in cases of SARS linked to COVID-19 at municipal level. Around 18% of Brazil's elderly population live more than 4 kilometer from a vaccination point. A total of 4,790 municipalities showed an upward trend in SARS cases. The number of PCCs located more than 5 kilometer from cell towers was largest in the North and Northeast regions. Innovative stra tegies are needed to address the challenges posed by the implementation of the country's National COVID-19 Vaccination Plan. The use of spatial artificial intelligence-based methodologies can help improve the country's COVID-19 response."
