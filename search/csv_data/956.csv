Hence, memantine may potentially reduce SARS-CoV-2 virulence. https://bit.ly/2AZHiVg"
9553,Are open-source approaches the most efficient way forward for COVID-19 drug discovery?,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed the production of potential antivirals and vaccines from research organizations across the globe. The initial step for all drug discovery models is the identification of suitable targets. One approach organizations may take to tackle this involves issuing raw data publicly for collaboration with other organizations in order to spark discussion, collectively experiment and stay up to date with advances in scientific knowledge. Areas covered: Numerous organizations have released genomic data, amongst other tools, for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this has led to the development of growing datasets of knowledge for continued collaboration amongst different scientific communities. A different technique employs a more closed, market-driven method in order to stay ahead financially in the race for developing a suitable antiviral or vaccine. The latter allows sustained motivation for company ambitions and progress has been made toward clinical trials for potential drugs. Expert opinion: A case can be made for both open and closed drug discovery models; however, due to the rapidly evolving nature of this deadly virus, organizations should collate their research and support one another to ensure satisfactory treatment can be approved in a timely manner."
9554,Potential Immunomodulatory Properties of Biologically Active Components of Spices Against SARS-CoV-2 and Pan beta-Coronaviruses.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced COVID-19 has emerged as a defining global health crisis in current times. Data from the World Health Organization shows demographic variations in COVID-19 severity and lethality. Diet may play a significant role in providing beneficial host cell factors contributing to immunity against deadly SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Spices are essential components of the diet that possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral properties. Hyperinflammation, an aberrant systemic inflammation associated with pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, and multiorgan dysfunction, is a major clinical outcome in COVID-19. Knowing the beneficial properties of spices, we hypothesize that spice-derived bioactive components can modulate host immune responses to provide protective immunity in COVID-19. This study emphasizes that biologically active components of spices might alleviate the sustained pro-inflammatory condition by inhibiting the activity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukins (IL6, IL8), and chemokine (CCL2) known to be elevated in COVID-19. Spices may potentially prevent the tissue damage induced by oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory mediators during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current study also highlights the effects of spices on the antioxidant pathways mediated by Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) and Hmox1 (heme oxygenase 1) to restore oxidative homeostasis and protect from aberrant tissue damage. Taken together, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of bioactive components of spices may hold a promise to target the cellular pathways for developing antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 and pan β-coronaviruses."
9555,mTOR inhibition in COVID-19: A commentary and review of efficacy in RNA viruses.,"In this commentary, we shed light on the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in viral infections. The mTOR pathway has been demonstrated to be modulated in numerous RNA viruses. Frequently, inhibiting mTOR results in suppression of virus growth and replication. Recent evidence points towards modulation of mTOR in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We discuss the current literature on mTOR in SARS-CoV-2 and highlight evidence in support of a role for mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019."

9557,Using structural equation modeling to predict Indian people's attitudes and intentions towards COVID-19 vaccination.,"Background and aim: Understanding people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccination is crucial to the successful implementation of a vaccination program. Hence this research study seeks to identify critical factors influencing Indian people's attitudes and intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample (n = 254) drawn from Indian population, to assess the impact of perceived benefits, risk perceptions, social media exposure, social norms, and trust associated with Covid-19 vaccines on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccines and their intentions to take up the Covid-19 vaccinations. Results: The findings showed that the perceived benefits, social norms, and trust correlated significantly with people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. In contrast, risk perceptions and social media exposure showed an insignificant influence on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. Social norms, trust, and people's attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccinations are significantly correlated with their intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. On the contrary, social media exposure was found to have an insignificant influence on people's intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. Conclusion: Participants' intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations was influenced mainly by their attitudes and perceptions of Covid-19 vaccines in general, which strongly confirms the importance of various dimensions (perceived benefits, trust, social norms) of Covid-19 vaccines in cultivating Covid-19 vaccination acceptance among participants'."
