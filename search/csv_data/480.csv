4791,Is point-of-care testing feasible and safe in care homes in England? An exploratory usability and accuracy evaluation of a point-of-care polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2.,"Introduction: Reliable rapid testing for COVID-19 is needed in care homes to reduce the risk of outbreaks and enable timely care. This study aimed to examine the usability and test performance of a point of care polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 (POCKITTM Central) in care homes. Methods: POCKITTM Central was evaluated in a purposeful sample of four UK care homes. Test agreement with laboratory real-time PCR and usability and used errors were assessed. Results: No significant usability-related hazards emerged, and the sources of error identified were found to be amendable with minor changes in training or test workflow. POCKITTM Central has acceptable sensitivity and specificity based on RT-PCR as the reference standard, especially for symptomatic cases.Asymptomatic specimens showed 83.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 35.9-99.6%) positive agreement and 98.7% negative agreement (95% CI: 96.2-99.7%), with overall prevalence and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) of 0.965 (95% CI: 0.932- 0.999). Symptomatic specimens showed 100% (95% CI: 2.5-100%) positive agreement and 100% negative agreement (95% CI: 85.8-100%), with overall PABAK of 1.Recommendations are provided to mitigate the frequency of occurrence of the residual use errors observed. Integration pathways were discussed to identify opportunities and limitations of adopting POCKITâ„¢ Central for screening and diagnostic testing purposes. Conclusions: Point-of-care PCR testing in care homes can be considered with appropriate preparatory steps and safeguards. Further diagnostic accuracy evaluations and in-service evaluation studies should be conducted, if the test is to be implemented more widely, to build greater certainty on this initial exploratory analysis."
4792,Herd immunization with childhood vaccination may provide protection against COVID-19.,"It may take time to obtain a vaccine for the current COVID-19, and the virus genome may keep an evolution and mutations, so a universal and effective vaccine for the coronavirus may not be possible. Epidemiological studies reveal the infection of SARS and COVID-19 in children is less frequent and less severe than in adults. Childhood vaccine-mediated cross cellular immunity and immunomodulation might provide protection against the infections of COVID-19. These data suggest that herd immunization with children vaccines in adults may improve the adult cross cellular immunity and immunomodulation and improve their clinical presentation and prognosis. This can be also useful to cope with future pandemics."
4793,Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: Building Trust to Protect Nursing Home Staff and Residents.,"Vaccines are critical to protect both nursing home residents and staff from COVID-19, but some staff have expressed reservations about being vaccinated. In this brief report, we describe interventions that Genesis HealthCare-one of the largest US long-term care providers-implemented after recognizing midway through vaccinations that racial and ethnic disparities existed in vaccine uptake among employees, with black and Hispanic employees having significantly lower rates of vaccination than their peers. Specifically, Genesis engaged its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to identify ways to augment its already comprehensive vaccine education campaign in order to build confidence among employees from minority communities. Interventions implemented beginning in late January 2021 included adding DEI representatives to information sessions to facilitate culturally sensitive discussions; holding information sessions at all times of day and night, and inviting employees' family members to join; increasing availability of multilingual educational materials; and featuring DEI representatives in social media campaigns. Between the end of January and beginning of March 2021, we observed statistically significant improvements in the likelihood of black and Hispanic employees being vaccinated relative to white employees, calculated as the relative risk of vaccination, suggesting a reduction in vaccination disparity. Whether these trends are directly related to the organization's efforts, or rather reflect individuals needing longer to become comfortable with the vaccines, is difficult to discern in the absence of a formal pragmatic trial. Still, these findings support the continuation of targeted educational and engagement efforts to improve vaccine uptake among staff, and the critical need to ensure that nursing homes have ongoing access to vaccine supply to continue their vaccination programs."
4794,Perspective on the Role of Antibodies and Potential Therapeutic Drugs to Combat COVID-19.,"The sudden emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has brought the world to a standstill. Thousands of people across the globe are biting the dust with every passing day and yet more are being tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In order to dispense this current crisis, numerous treatment options have been tried and tested and many more are still under scrutiny. The development of vaccines may help in the prevention of the global pandemic, however, there is still a need for the development of alternate approaches to combat the disease. In this review we highlight the new discoveries and furtherance in the antibody based therapeutic options and the potent drugs, with special emphasis on the development of the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and the repurposed drugs, which may prove to be of significant importance for the treatment of COVID-19, in the days to come. It is an attempt to evaluate the currently presented challenges so as to provide a scope for the ongoing research and assistance in the development of the effective therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2."
4795,A qualitative study exploring the relationship between mothers' vaccine hesitancy and health beliefs with COVID-19 vaccination intention and prevention during the early pandemic months.,"Vaccine hesitancy is a top ten global health threat that can negatively impact COVID-19 vaccine uptake. It is assumed that vaccine refusers hold deep, negative beliefs, while acceptors hold strong, positive beliefs. However, vaccine hesitancy exists along a continuum and is multidimensional, varying by time, place, vaccine, subgroup, and person. Guided by the Health Belief Model and vaccine hesitancy frameworks, the study purpose was to qualitatively explore maternal COVID-19 threat perceptions and willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in light of their expressed vaccine hesitancy toward past school required and routinely recommended vaccines and the HPV vaccine for their children. Researchers conducted twenty-five interviews with US Midwestern mothers during the early COVID-19 pandemic months. Mothers were grouped by vaccine hesitancy categories and thematic analysis was used to analyze the data within and across categories. Results showed that prior vaccine hesitancy attitudes and behavior did not fully capture maternal acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine or perception of COVID-19 threat. Perceptions of COVID-19 threat did influence mothers' decisions about COVID-19 protective behaviors (e.g., handwashing, mask wearing, and distancing). However, mothers were hesitant to accept the COVID-19 vaccine across vaccine hesitancy categories, primarily citing concerns about safety, efficacy, and confusion over conflicting information as barriers to immediate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Findings indicate that mothers cannot be grouped together based on hesitancy about, or acceptance of, other vaccines for purposes of assuming COVID-19 preventive behavior adherence or anticipated COVID-19 vaccine acceptance."
4796,Seroepidemiologic Study Designs for Determining SARS-COV-2 Transmission and Immunity.,"Serologic studies are crucial for clarifying dynamics of the coronavirus disease pandemic. Past work on serologic studies (e.g., during influenza pandemics) has made relevant contributions, but specific conditions of the current situation require adaptation. Although detection of antibodies to measure exposure, immunity, or both seems straightforward conceptually, numerous challenges exist in terms of sample collection, what the presence of antibodies actually means, and appropriate analysis and interpretation to account for test accuracy and sampling biases. Successful deployment of serologic studies depends on type and performance of serologic tests, population studied, use of adequate study designs, and appropriate analysis and interpretation of data. We highlight key questions that serologic studies can help answer at different times, review strengths and limitations of different assay types and study designs, and discuss methods for rapid sharing and analysis of serologic data to determine global transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2."
4797,In silico discovery of antigenic proteins and epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 for the development of a vaccine or a diagnostic approach for COVID-19.,"In the genome of SARS-CoV-2, the 5'-terminus encodes a polyprotein, which is further cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins whereas the 3' terminus encodes four structural proteins and eight accessory proteins. Among these 27 proteins, the present study aimed to discover likely antigenic proteins and epitopes to be used for the development of a vaccine or serodiagnostic assay using an in silico approach. For this purpose, after the full genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan isolate and variant proteins that are detected frequently, surface proteins including spike, envelope, and membrane proteins as well as proteins with signal peptide were determined as probable vaccine candidates whereas the remaining were considered as possible antigens to be used during the development of serodiagnostic assays. According to results obtained, among 27 proteins, 26 of them were predicted as probable antigen. In 26 proteins, spike protein was selected as the best vaccine candidate because of having a signal peptide, negative GRAVY value, one transmembrane helix, moderate aliphatic index, a big molecular weight, a long-estimated half-life, beta wrap motifs as well as having stable, soluble and non-allergic features. In addition, orf7a, orf8, and nsp-10 proteins with signal peptide were considered as potential vaccine candidates. Nucleocapsid protein and a highly antigenic GGDGKMKD epitope were identified as ideal antigens to be used in the development of serodiagnostic assays. Moreover, considering MHC-I alleles, highly antigenic KLNDLCFTNV and ITLCFTLKRK epitopes can be used to develop an epitope-based peptide vaccine."
4798,COVID-19 Vaccination Perception and Attitude among Healthcare Workers in Egypt.,"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic has affected the whole world, especially the frontline worriers. To get shielded through this war, the world is racing to reach and manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination hesitancy is one of the significant obstacles to global health. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the perception and attitude of healthcare workers in Egypt toward COVID-19 vaccines, acknowledge the determinants of their attitude, and the factors that could increase the acceptance of the vaccine. Methods: an observational web-based anonymous survey was conducted on 385 Egyptian healthcare workers in different governorates. The questionnaire-based on Vaccine Hesitancy Survey Questions of the World Health Organization was available in Arabic and English languages and was tested for reliability. Results: Regarding vaccination decision, 51% of the participants were undecided, 28% refused, and 21% accepted vaccination. Reasons for vaccine acceptance mainly were risks of COVID-19 (93%), safety (57.5%), and effectiveness (56.25%) of the vaccine. Simultaneously, the reasons for vaccine hesitancy were the absence of enough clinical trials (92.4%) and fear of side effects of the vaccine (91.4%). The leading factor that could increase vaccination acceptance among the participants was to get sufficient and accurate information about the available vaccines. The participants revealed a high mean level of concern for COVID-19 vaccines' safety (3.8 of 5) that differs significantly among the different study groups (P-value .002). Conclusion: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, only approximately 21% of Egyptian healthcare workers in our study accepted the COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy represents a major barrier to implementing vaccination programs."
