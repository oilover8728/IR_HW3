520,Serological and Molecular Tests for COVID-19: a recent update.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is probably the most devastating worldwide challenge in recent century. COVID-19 leads to a mild to severe respiratory disease and affects different organs and has become a global concern since December 2019. Meanwhile, molecular biology and diagnostic laboratories played an essential role in diagnosis of the disease by introducing serological and molecular tests. Molecular-based techniques are reliable detection tools for SARS-CoV-2 and used for diagnosis of patients especially in the early stage of the disease. While, serological assays are considered as additional tools to verify the asymptomatic infections, tracing previous contacts of individuals, vaccine efficacy, and study the seroprevalance. The average time of the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the patient's serum is 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms for both IgM and IgA and 10-18 days for IgG. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, FDA has approved and authorized a series of serological laboratory tests for early diagnosis. Serological assays have low-cost and provide fast results but have poor sensitivity in the early stage of the viral infection. Although the serological tests may not play an important role in the active case of COVID-19, it could be effective to determine the immunity of health care workers, and confirm late COVID-19 cases during the outbreak. In this review, we compared various laboratory diagnostic assays for COVID-19."

522,Interlaboratory Agreement of Anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Serologic Assays in the Expedited College of American Pathologists Proficiency Testing Program.,"Context.—: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged, currently pandemic virus, and the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become widespread, but data regarding the interlaboratory performance of these serologic assays are limited. Objective.—: To describe the development and initial results of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) SARS-CoV-2 Serology Survey. Design.—: Members from the CAP Microbiology and Diagnostic Immunology and Flow Cytometry Committees formed a working group to support development of a new proficiency testing survey for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Supplemental questions in the survey assessed the state of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among participating laboratories as of July 2020. Results were analyzed for agreement by immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype tested, assay manufacturer, and methodology. Results.—: A total of 4125 qualitative results were received from 1110 laboratories participating in the first survey. Qualitative agreement for assays measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies or IgG was greater than 90% for all 3 samples in the survey. Qualitative agreement for IgM and IgA for the negative sample was greater than 95%, but lacked consensus for the other 2 samples. Conclusions.—: These initial data suggest overall excellent agreement and comparable performance for most qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and total antibody assays across all participating clinical laboratories, regardless of specific target antigen or assay methodology."

524,Performance evaluation of a lateral flow assay for nasopharyngeal antigen detection for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic due to its capacity for rapid transmission. In this context, an early and rapid diagnosis of infected patients that do not require expensive equipment or highly trained personnel is crucial in order to reduce the contagious rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate a chromatographic immunoassay's performance for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-antigen. Methods: A cross-sectional study included 369 adults from Western México with diagnosis or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two samples were collected; a naso-oropharyngeal was used for a molecular determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The molecular analysis was carried out using DeCoV19 Kit Triplex (Genes2life S.A.P.I.) based on the CDC diagnostic panel for N1, N2, and N3 regions. The second sample was retrieved from a nasopharyngeal rub and used for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 antigen employing the commercial STANDARD™ Q COVID-19 Ag Test (SD BIOSENSOR). Results: Overall, in 28.2% of the patients was detected the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 21.4% were positive for antigen detection. The rapid antigen test showed a sensitivity and specificity of 75.9% and 100%, respectively, with a positive predictive and negative values of 100% and 91%. Symptoms as anosmia presented a high OR for the positive diagnosis for both test, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the rapid antigen test of 8.86 (CI = 4.91-16) and 6.09 (CI = 3.42-10.85), respectively. Conclusion: SD BIOSENSOR is a useful assay, but some caveats must be considered before the general implementation."

526,Comparison of the Roche cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test and the Taiwan CDC protocol for the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19.,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant challenges throughout the world and a rapid, reliable diagnostic test is in high demand. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was one of the most quickly established methods of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection and is considered to be the gold standard. In this report, we share our experience of using two different testing platforms: the cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test, an automated system that was recently granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA, and a laboratory-developed test based on the protocol from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC). There was an overall 96.2% agreement between the two platforms. However, the positive agreement between the two platforms was only 80.0%. We found 3 instances of discordance between the two systems and this emphasized the need for timely diagnosis with a reliable testing platform."
527,Extraction-free protocol combining proteinase K and heat inactivation for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR.,"Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is the gold-standard technique for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection in nasopharyngeal swabs specimens. The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples in saline solution. The method includes a treatment with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT-qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples. In conclusion, PK+HID is a robust, fast and inexpensive procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. The National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices of Argentina has recently authorized the use of this method."
528,Ensuring trust in COVID-19 data: A retrospective cohort study.,"There are no standardized methods for collecting and reporting coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) data. We aimed to compare the proportion of patients admitted for COVID-19-related symptoms and those admitted for other reasons who incidentally tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Retrospective cohort studyData were sampled twice weekly between March 26 and June 6, 2020 from a ""COVID-19 dashboard,"" a system-wide administrative database that includes the number of hospitalized patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Patient charts were subsequently reviewed and the principal reason for hospitalization abstracted.Data collected during a statewide lockdown revealed that 92 hospitalized patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. Among these individuals, 4.3% were hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19-related symptoms but were incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive. After the lockdown was suspended, the total inpatient census of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients increased to 128, 20.3% of whom were hospitalized for non-COVID-19-related complaints.In the absence of a statewide lockdown, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients admitted for non-COVID-19-related complaints who were incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive. In order to ensure data integrity, coding should distinguish between patients with COVID-19-related symptoms and asymptomatic patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus."
529,Synthetic proteins for COVID-19 diagnostics.,"There is an urgent need for inexpensive, rapid and specific antigen-based assays to test for vaccine efficacy and detect infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. We have identified a small, synthetic protein (JS7), representing a region of maximum variability within the receptor binding domain (RBD), which binds antibodies in sera from nine patients with PCR-verified COVID-19 of varying severity. Antibodies binding to either JS7 or the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD, as well as those that disrupt binding between a fragment of the ACE2 receptor and the RBD, are proportional to disease severity and clinical outcome. Binding to JS7 was inhibited by linear peptides from the RBD interface with ACE2. Variants of JS7, such as E484K or N501Y, can be quickly synthesized in pure form in large quantities by automated methods. JS7 and related synthetic antigens can provide a basis for specific diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infections."
