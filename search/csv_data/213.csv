2120,Development and validation of viral load assays to quantitate SARS-CoV-2.,"SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 30 million persons throughout the world. A subset of patients suffer serious consequences that require hospitalization and ventilator support. Current tests for SARS-CoV-2 generate qualitative results and are vital to make a diagnosis of the infection. However, they are not helpful to follow changes in viral loads after diagnosis. The ability to quantitatively assess viral levels is necessary to determine the effectiveness of therapy with anti-viral or immune agents. Viral load analysis is also necessary to determine the replicative potential of strains with different mutations, emergence of resistance to anti-viral agents and the stability of viral nucleic acid and degree of RT-PCR inhibition in different types of collection media. Quantitative viral load analysis in body fluids, plasma and tissue may be helpful to determine the effects of the infection in various organ systems. To address these needs, we developed two assays to quantitate SARS-CoV-2. The assays target either the S or E genes in the virus, produce comparable viral load results, are highly sensitive and specific and have a wide range of quantitation. We believe that these assays will be helpful to manage the clinical course of infected patients and may also help to better understand the biology of infection with SARS-CoV-2."
2121,[Covid-19 reinfections: what is the clinical relevance?].,"Every day additional confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection are being reported across the globe. In the Netherlands more than 50 cases of probable reinfections have been identified. With more than 500 thousand people in the Netherlands who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up till now this number does seems to be quite low. Still, important questions have to be asked. How do we define reinfection and how do these reinfections compare to other (corona) viruses? What is the immunological significance? What is the duration of protective immunity? And what does Covid-19 reinfections mean for the prevention and development of a vaccine? The described cases of re-infections do teach us that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should also be considered for people with a documented Covid-19 infection in the past and that general precautions, such as the use of face masks and social distancing, still apply to those with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection."

2125,"Designing and Interpreting Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Diagnostics: Mathematics, Visual Logistics, and Low Prevalence.","Context.—: Coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) diagnostics require understanding of how predictive values depend on sensitivity, specificity, and especially, low prevalence. Clear expectations, high sensitivity and specificity, and manufacturer disclosure will facilitate excellence of tests. Objectives.—: To derive mathematical equations for designing and interpreting COVID-19 tests, assess US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization and Health Canada minimum requirements, establish sensitivity and specificity tiers, and enhance clinical performance in low prevalence settings. Design.—: PubMed and other sources generated articles on COVID-19 testing and prevalence. EndNote X9.1 consolidated references. Mathematica and open access software helped prove equations, perform recursive calculations, graph multivariate relationships, and visualize patterns, including a new relationship, predictive value geometric mean-squared. Results.—: Derived equations were used to illustrate shortcomings of COVID-19 diagnostics in low prevalence. Visual logistics helped establish sensitivity/specificity tiers. FDA/Canada's 90% sensitivity, 95% specificity minimum requirements generate excessive false positives at low prevalence. False positives exceed true positives at prevalence lower than 5.3%, or if sensitivity is improved to 100% and specificity to 98%, at prevalence lower than 2%. Recursive testing improves predictive value. Three tiers emerged from these results. With 100% sensitivity, physicians can select desired predictive values, then input local prevalence, to determine suitable specificity. Conclusions.—: Understanding low prevalence impact will help health care providers meet COVID-19 needs for effective testing. Laypersons should receive clinical performance disclosure when submitting specimens. Home testing needs to meet the same high standards as other tests. In the long run, it will be more cost-effective to improve COVID-19 point-of-care tests rather than repeat testing multiple times."
2126,Non-Receptor-Mediated Lipid Membrane Permeabilization by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein S1 Subunit.,"Due to the pressing need to generate specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 and management of its outbreak, detailed knowledge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and timely, cheap, and easy-to-use detection methods are of critical importance for containing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Through electrophysiology and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments, we show that even in the absence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, the S1 subunit from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to neutral phospholipid membranes leads to their mechanical destabilization and permeabilization. A similar cytotoxic effect of the protein was seen in human lung epithelial cells. A monoclonal antibody generated toward the S1 subunit alleviates to a considerable extent the destabilizing potential of the protein in such model membranes. Finally, we demonstrate the proof-of-concept capability of an α-hemolysin (α-HL) protein nanopore to detect in aqueous buffer and real time the region-binding domain of the S1 subunit from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by monitoring its immunological interaction with a target antibody. Our results may offer new perspectives in understanding the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, its treatment, and real-time detection."

2129,Comparison of molecular testing strategies for COVID-19 control: a mathematical modelling study.,"Background: WHO has called for increased testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but countries have taken different approaches and the effectiveness of alternative strategies is unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports. Findings: If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32-55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14-35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95-99% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays. Interpretation: Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges. Funding: UK Medical Research Council."
