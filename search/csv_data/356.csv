3551,Developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on probe mix and amplitude based multiplexing.,"Introduction: With the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, different articles have been published highlighting the superiority of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) over the gold-standard reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, few studies have been reported on developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and their performance. This study shows steps on how to develop different ddPCR SAR-CoV-2 assays including higher order multiplex assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and antiviral screening.Methods: Using multiple primer/probe sets, we developed, optimized, and analyzed the performance of simplex (1 target), duplex (2 targets), triplex probe mix (3 targets), and quadruplex (4 targets) SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR assays based on a two-color ddPCR detection system.Results: Results showed that the quadruplex assay had similar limits of detection and accuracy to the lower multiplex assays. Analyzing 94 clinical samples demonstrated that the ddPCR triplex probe mix assay had better sensitivity than the RT-qPCR assay. Additionally, the ddPCR multiplex assay showed that remdesivir could inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro while another testing drug could not.Conclusion: Our research shows that developing multiplex ddPCR assays is possible by combing probe mix and amplitude-based multiplexing, which will help in developing multiplexed ddPCR assays for different SARS-CoV-2 applications."

3554,A deep dive into testing and management of COVID-19 for Australian high performance and professional sport.,"The purpose of testing for any communicable disease is to support clinicians in the diagnosis and management of individual patients and to describe transmission dynamics. The novel coronavirus is formally named SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical disease state resulting from an infection is known as COVID-19. Control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires clinicians, epidemiologists, and public health officials to utilise the most comprehensive, accurate and timely information available to manage the rapidly evolving COVID-19 environment. High performance sport is a unique context that may look towards comprehensive testing as a means of risk mitigation. Characteristics of the common testing options are discussed including the circumstances where additional testing may be of benefit and considerations for the associated risks. Finally, a review of the available technology that could be considered for use by medical staff at the point of care (PoC) in a high-performance sporting context is included."

Micro-neutralisation assays with sera obtained after Comirnaty (BNT162b2, BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccination in 36 healthcare workers (31 female) demonstrated significant fold change reduction in neutralising titres compared with the original virus: Gamma (P.1) 2.3, Beta (B.1.351) 10.4, Delta 2.1 and 2.6. The reduction of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant was not significant. Despite being lower, remaining neutralisation capacity conferred by Comirnaty against Delta and other VOCs is probably protective."

3558,Safety and Tolerability of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in Dialyzed Patients. COViNEPH Project.,"Background and Objectives: The Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 mRNA vaccine has demonstrated excellent efficacy and safety in phase 3 trials. However, no dialyzed patients were included, and therefore safety data for this patient group is lacking. The aim of the study was to assess the safety and tolerances of vaccinations with BNT162b2 performed in chronically dialyzed patients. Materials and Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study including a group of 190 dialyzed patients (65% male) at median age 68.0 (55-74) years. 169 (89.0%) patients were treated with hemodialysis and 21 (11.0%) with peritoneal dialysis. The control group consisted of 160 people (61% male) without chronic kidney disease at median age 63 (range 53-77) years. Both groups were vaccinated with BNT162b2 with a 21-day interval between the first and the second dose. Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity, unsolicited adverse events and antipyretic and pain medication use were assessed with a standardized questionnaire. The toxicity grading scales were derived from the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research guidelines. Results: 59.8% (dose 1), 61.4% (dose 2) and 15.9% (dose 1), 29.4% (dose 2) dialyzed patients reported at least one local and one systemic reaction respectively within seven days after the vaccination. Many local and systemic solicited reactions were observed less frequently in dialyzed patients than in the age and sex matched control group and much less frequently than reported in the pivotal study. They were mostly mild to moderate, short-lived, and more frequently reported in younger individuals and women. No related unsolicited adverse events were observed. Conclusions: We have shown here that BNT162b2, an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against SARS-COV-2 is safe and well-tolerated by dialyzed patients. The results can be useful for the nephrological community to resolve patients' doubts and reduce their vaccine hesitancy."
3559,Cancer patients and internal medicine patients attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination in Poland.,"Background: The initial approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marked a milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased public debate about the vaccine development process and vaccine side effects has activated the anti-vaccine community, which has begun to spread conspiracy theories about vaccine safety. Objectives: Our study is the first to investigate the awareness of Polish patients suffering from various chronic diseases, mainly cancer, about vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Material and methods: An anonymous survey was made available from November 2020 to February 2021 to representatives of patient organizations through social media (Facebook) and to patients in the Chemotherapy Department of the Clinical Hospital in Pozna≈Ñ. The survey was completed by 836 patients. The majority of the survey respondents had cancer (77%, n = 644), and almost 1/5 of the respondents indicated hypertension (15.7%, n = 131) as well as depression and/or anxiety disorders (11.1%, n = 93). Results: Less than half of the respondents (43.5%, n = 364) believed that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were safe (40.4%, n = 260, among cancer patients; 53.9%, n = 104, among patients with other medical conditions). More than half of the respondents (60.5%, n = 506) intended to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (58.8%, n = 378, among cancer patients; 66.3%, n = 128, among patients with other medical conditions). Fear of vaccine complications and lack of belief in vaccine effectiveness were prevalent among both cancer patients and patients with other medical conditions. Conclusions: The vast majority of cancer and medical patients wanted to be vaccinated against COVID-19. More than half of the respondents did not believe that the COVID-19 vaccine would be safe for them. Education of cancer and medical patients on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, as well as the use of additional protective measures against infection, is an extremely important element of prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic."
