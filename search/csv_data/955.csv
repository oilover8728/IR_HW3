9540,Assessment of sample pooling for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing for screening of asymptomatic persons in Tunisia.,The aim of this study is to test a pooling approach for the RT-PCR test to detect low viral loads of SARS-CoV-2. We found that a single positive specimen can still be detected in pools of up to 10. Each laboratory should conduct its own evaluation and validation of pooling protocols according to its specific context.
9541,"Pathogenesis of COVID-19, Disease Outbreak: A Review.","Coronavirus-19 is a severe acute respiratory disorder in humans which has become a major health problem. It spreads out very rapidly throughout the world since it has been first identified in Wuhan, China (December 2019). The causative virus is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. And the World Health Organization has named this respiratory syndrome as a new epidemic disease called COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 continued to increase with three million confirmed infected cases and with 244,000 death cases worldwide. Until now there is no specific treatment or vaccine available against COVID- 19. The collective information about the different aspects of COVID-19 viral infection has been gathered from renowned journals, and electronic databases including Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed from 1990 to 2020. This manuscript has highlighted the transmission and symptoms of Covid-19. Therefore, these studies show how the SARS-CoV 2 can facilitate the debut of the virus into targeted host cells."
9542,Insights on 3D Structures of Potential Drug-targeting Proteins of SARS-CoV-2: Application of Cavity Search and Molecular Docking.,"The emergence of the COVID-19 has caused public health problems worldwide and there is no effective pharmacological treatment for this disease. Research on 3D models of proteins and the search for active molecular sites are important tools to assist in the discovery of effective antiviral drugs to combat COVID-19. To address this problem, the 3D protein structures of SARS-CoV 2 were analyzed and submitted to cavities research, evaluation of their druggabillity and liganbility, and applied to molecular docking studies with potential ligand candidates actually assayed against COVID-19. Eight druggable potential cavity sites were determined in model structures' PDB code, 6W4B, 6VWW, 6W01, 6M3M, and 6VYO, and these are the good alternatives to be characterized as targets for antiviral compounds. The good cavity model of the protease 3D structure was used in molecular docking, and this allowed verifying the theoric interactions of this protein and lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral drugs. These results may assist in the use of 3D protein models in drug design studies aiming to develop drugs against the COVID-19 pandemic."
9543,Fiber-optic label-free biosensor for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection using biofunctionalized long-period fiber grating.,"With COVID-19 widespread worldwide, people are still struggling to develop faster and more accurate diagnostic methods. Here we demonstrated the label-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by employing a SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody-conjugated phase-shifted long-period fiber grating (PS-LPFG) inscribed with a CO2 laser. At a specific cladding mode, the wavelength separation (λD) between the two split dips of a PS-LPFG varies with the external refractive index, although it is virtually insensitive to ambient temperature variations. To detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies were immobilized on the fiber surface of the fabricated PS-LPFG functionalized through chemical modification. When exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with different concentrations, the antibody-immobilized PS-LPFG exhibited the variation of λD according to the protein concentration, which was caused by bioaffinity binding-induced local changes in the refractive index at its surface. In particular, we also confirmed the potential of our sensor for clinical application by detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in virus transport medium. Moreover, our sensor could distinguish SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from those of MERS-CoV and offer efficient properties such as reusability and storage stability. Hence, we have successfully fabricated a promising optical transducer for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which can be unperturbed by external temperature disturbances."
9544,"Neurological symptoms, manifestations, and complications associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, is responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has become a challenging world issue. Although most COVID-19 patients primarily develop respiratory symptoms, an increasing number of neurological symptoms and manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been observed. In this narrative review, we elaborate on proposed neurotropic mechanisms and various neurological symptoms, manifestations, and complications of COVID-19 reported in the present literature. For this purpose, a review of all current published literature (studies, case reports, case series, reviews, editorials, and other articles) was conducted and neurological sequelae of COVID-19 were summarized. Essential and common neurological symptoms including gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, myalgia, headache, altered mental status, confusion, delirium, and dizziness are presented separately in sections. Moreover, neurological manifestations and complications that are of great concern such as stroke, cerebral (sinus) venous thrombosis, seizures, meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, acute myelitis, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) are also addressed systematically. Future studies that examine the impact of neurological symptoms and manifestations on the course of the disease are needed to further clarify and assess the link between neurological complications and the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. To limit long-term consequences, it is crucial that healthcare professionals can early detect possible neurological symptoms and are well versed in the increasingly common neurological manifestations and complications of COVID-19."
9545,Control of exhaled SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosols in the interpersonal breathing microenvironment in a ventilated room with limited space air stability.,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights the importance of understanding and controlling the spread of the coronavirus between persons. We experimentally and numerically investigated an advanced engineering and environmental method on controlling the transmission of airborne SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosols in the breathing microenvironment between two persons during interactive breathing process by combining the limited space air stability and a ventilation method. Experiments were carried out in a full-scale ventilated room with different limited space air stability conditions, i.e., stable condition, neutral condition and unstable condition. Two real humans were involved to conducted normal breathing process in the room and the exhaled carbon dioxide was used as the surrogate of infectious airborne SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosols from respiratory activities. A correspondent numerical model was established to visualize the temperature field and contaminated field in the test room. Results show that the performance of a ventilation system on removing infectious airborne SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosols from the interpersonal breathing microenvironment is dependent on the limited space air stability conditions. Appropriate ventilation method should be implemented based on an evaluation of the air condition. It is recommended that total volume ventilation methods are suitable for unstable and neutral conditions and local ventilation methods are preferable for stable conditions. This study provides an insight into the transmission of airborne SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosols between persons in ventilated rooms with different limited space air stability conditions. Useful guidance has been provided to cope with COVID-19 in limited spaces."
9546,"The Algerian Chapter of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: An Evolutionary, Genetic, and Epidemiological Prospect.","To explore the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Algeria, a dataset comprising ninety-five genomes originating from SARS-CoV-2 sampled from Algeria and other countries worldwide, from 24 December 2019, through 4 March 2021, was thoroughly examined. While performing a multi-component analysis regarding the Algerian outbreak, the toolkit of phylogenetic, phylogeographic, haplotype, and genomic analysis were effectively implemented. We estimated the Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) in reference to the Algerian pandemic and highlighted the multiple introductions of the disease and the missing data depicted in the transmission loop. In addition, we emphasized the significant role played by local and international travels in disease dissemination. Most importantly, we unveiled mutational patterns, the effect of unique mutations on corresponding proteins, and the relatedness regarding the Algerian sequences to other sequences worldwide. Our results revealed individual amino-acid replacements such as the deleterious replacement A23T in the orf3a gene in Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241. Additionally, a connection between Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037 and sequences originating from the USA was observed through a USA characteristic amino-acid replacement T1004I in the nsp3 gene, found in the aforementioned Algerian sequence. Similarly, successful tracing could be established, such as Algeria/G37318-8849/2020|EPI_ISL_766863, which was imported from Saudi Arabia during the pilgrimage. Lastly, we assessed the Algerian mitigation measures regarding disease containment using statistical analyses."
9547,Large-scale implementation of pooled RNA extraction and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection.,"Introduction: Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection is a fundamental tool in the public health measures taken to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the overwhelming use of SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription (RT)-PCR tests worldwide, the availability of test kits has become a major bottleneck and the need to increase testing throughput is rising. We aim to overcome these challenges by pooling samples together, and performing RNA extraction and RT-PCR in pools. Methods: We tested the efficiency and sensitivity of pooling strategies for RNA extraction and RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. We tested 184 samples both individually and in pools to estimate the effects of pooling. We further implemented Dorfman pooling with a pool size of eight samples in large-scale clinical tests. Results: We demonstrated pooling strategies that increase testing throughput while maintaining high sensitivity. A comparison of 184 samples tested individually and in pools of eight samples showed that test results were not significantly affected. Implementing the eight-sample Dorfman pooling to test 26 576 samples from asymptomatic individuals, we identified 31 (0.12%) SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, achieving a 7.3-fold increase in throughput. Discussion: Pooling approaches for SARS-CoV-2 testing allow a drastic increase in throughput while maintaining clinical sensitivity. We report the successful large-scale pooled screening of asymptomatic populations."
9548,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) /Hepatitis B virus (HBV) Co-infected Patients: A case series and review of the literature.,"Objective: We aimed to determine whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection affects liver function and the outcome of the disease. Methods: One hundred fifty-six laboratories confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were followed up between 1 July and 31 December 2020 and analysed retrospectively. Continuous variables were compared with the independent samples t-test. Categorical variables were compared using the Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact test. A P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The age range of the cohort was from 40 to 78 and 73 (46.8%) of 156 patients were male. There was no significant difference in age and gender distribution between 20 patients (12.8%) with SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfection and 136 patients without HBV infection (87.2%) (P > .05). Liver function tests were higher in the SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfected patient group but were not statistically significant. The levels of creatine kinase (CK) were significantly higher in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients without HBV infection compared with the SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfected patient group (P = .0047). Severe/critical illness was less common in the SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfected patient group, and no deaths were observed. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfection did not change the severity and outcome of COVID-19. However, the patients with SARS-CoV-2/HBV coinfection should be closely monitored for liver complications."
9549,Genomic characterization and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 of a Canadian population.,"COVID-19 has greatly affected public health and world economy. In this study, we analyzed 129 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV-2 viruses of a Canadian population during early phase of the pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three major paths of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into Canada. Twenty-one substitutions that have frequencies greater than 3% of viral population were identified. Analysis of these substitutions indicated that P1427I (ORF1b), Y1464C (ORF1b), and Q57H (ORF3a) might affect functions of the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins. Additionally, we found the evidence of positive selection on the ORF3a and codon 614 of Spike protein, suggesting the viral components responsible for host entry and activation of inflammation response were targeted by host immune responses. The study showed genomic variation and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a Canadian population. These information may help develop preventive strategies and be used for further study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and therapeutics development."
