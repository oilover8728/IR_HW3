3260,The continued advance of vaccine adjuvants - 'we can work it out'.,"In the last decade there have been some significant advances in vaccine adjuvants, particularly in relation to their inclusion in licensed products. This was proceeded by several decades in which such advances were very scarce, or entirely absent, but several novel adjuvants have now been included in licensed products, including in the US. These advances have relied upon several key technological insights that have emerged in this time period, which have finally allowed an in depth understanding of how adjuvants work. These advances include developments in systems biology approaches which allow the hypotheses first advanced in pre-clinical studies to be critically evaluated in human studies. This review highlights these recent advances, both in relation to the adjuvants themselves, but also the technologies that have enabled their successes. Moreover, we critically appraise what will come next, both in terms of new adjuvant molecules, and the technologies needed to allow them to succeed. We confidently predict that additional adjuvants will emerge in the coming years that will reach approval in licensed products, but that the components might differ significantly from those which are currently used. Gradually, the natural products that were originally used to build adjuvants, since they were readily available at the time of initial development, will come to be replaced by synthetic or biosynthetic materials, with more appealing attributes, including more reliable and robust supply, along with reduced heterogeneity. The recent advance in vaccine adjuvants is timely, given the need to create novel vaccines to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although, we must ensure that the rigorous safety evaluations that allowed the current adjuvants to advance are not 'short-changed' in the push for new vaccines to meet the global challenge as quickly as possible, we must not jeopardize what we have achieved, by pushing less established technologies too quickly, if the data does not fully support it."
3261,Analyzing the attitude of Indian citizens towards COVID-19 vaccine - A text analytics study.,"Background and aims: The government of India recently planned to start the process of the mass vaccination program to end the COVID-19 crises. However, the process of vaccination was not made mandatory, and there are a lot of aspects that arise skepticism in the minds of common people regarding COVID-19 vaccines. This study using machine learning techniques analyzes the major concerns Indian citizens voice out about COVID-19 vaccines in social media. Methods: For this study, we have used social media posts as data. Using Python, we have scrapped the social media posts of Indian citizens discussing about the COVID- 19 vaccine. In Study 1, we performed a sentimental analysis to determine how the general perception of Indian citizens regarding the COVID-19 vaccine changes over different months of COVID-19 crises. In Study 2, we have performed topic modeling to understand the major issues that concern the general public regarding the COVID- 19 vaccine. Results: Our results have indicated that 47% of social media posts discussing vaccines were in a neutral tone, and nearly 17% of the social media posts discussing the COVID-19 vaccine were in a negative tone. Fear of health and allergic reactions towards the vaccine are the two prominent issues that concern Indian citizens regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: With the positive sentiments regarding vaccine is just over 35%, the Indian government needs to focus especially on addressing the fear of vaccines before implementing the process of mass vaccination."
3262,Large-scale national screening for Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China.,"Faced with the new challenges in the pandemic control, imported coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infections and asymptomatic infection, Chinese authorities have implemented new intervention measures-national large-scale nucleic acid testing. This article summarizes the population who needs the nucleic acid testing, analyzes the current data of COVID-19 testing capacity, concludes the timeline of coronavirus testing and suggests what needs to be done to facilitate the government large-scale screening measures."
3263,Recommendations for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 testing: a scoping review of current guidance.,"Background: Testing used in screening, diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 has been a subject of debate. Several organisations have developed formal advice about testing for COVID-19 to assist in the control of the disease. We collated, delineated and appraised current worldwide recommendations about the role and applications of tests to control SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Methods: We searched for documents providing recommendations for COVID-19 testing in PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database and relevant websites such as TRIP database, ECRI Guidelines Trust, the GIN database, from inception to 21 September 2020. Two reviewers applied the eligibility criteria to potentially relevant citations without language or geographical restrictions. We extracted data in duplicate, including assessment of methodological quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II tool. Results: We included 47 relevant documents and 327 recommendations about testing. Regarding the quality of the documents, we found that the domains with the lowest scores were 'Editorial independence' (Median=4%) and 'Applicability' (Median=6%). Only six documents obtained at least 50% score for the 'Rigour of development' domain. An important number of recommendations focused on the diagnosis of suspected cases (48%) and deisolation measures (11%). The most frequently recommended test was the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay (87 recommendations) and the chest CT (38 recommendations). There were 22 areas of agreement among guidance developers, including the use of RT-PCR for SARS-Cov-2 confirmation, the limited role of bronchoscopy, the use chest CT and chest X-rays for grading severity and the co-assessment for other respiratory pathogens. Conclusion: This first scoping review of recommendations for COVID-19 testing showed many limitations in the methodological quality of included guidance documents that could affect the confidence of clinicians in their implementation. Future guidance documents should incorporate a minimum set of key methodological characteristics to enhance their applicability for decision making."
3264,Could dentists be the first to diagnose COVID-19 due to oral manifestations?,"Data sources A search of electronic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) was carried out, with publication being set from 2019 to October 2020.Study selection Titles and abstracts from the original search were reviewed by two reviewers independently. Overall, 17 studies were included in the final analysis.Data extraction and synthesis Data extraction was conducted independently by two reviewers. Studies that were chosen were examined and the following data parameters were included: age and gender, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, COVID-19 manifestations, treatment for COVID-19, cutaneous lesions, oral manifestations, days after COVID-19 diagnosis, treat/healing or oral symptoms.Results Seventeen studies were included; 14 articles were case reports, two case series and one systematic review. The results showed that dry mouth, dysgeusia, oral ulcerations and opportunistic infections were among the most common oral manifestations expressed in COVID-19-positive patients.Conclusion The authors recommended carrying out careful clinical intraoral examinations on both COVID-19-positive patients or any patients requiring dental care, as oral symptoms can still be the only or initial symptom of COVID-19."
3265,"A review of nasopharyngeal swab and saliva tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection: Disease timelines, relative sensitivities, and test optimization.","Testing is an essential part of containment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. This review summarizes studies for SARS-CoV-2 infection and testing. Nasopharyngeal samples are best at sensitivity detection, especially in early stages of disease and in asymptomatic individuals. Current swab processing involves a 100- to 1000-fold dilution of the patient sample. Future optimization of testing should focus on using smaller volumes of viral transport media and swab designs to increase comfort and increased viral adhesion."
3266,A simple approach to optimum pool size for pooled SARS-CoV-2 testing.,"Systematic, large-scale testing of asymptomatic subjects is an important strategy in the management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In order to increase the capacity of laboratory-based molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing, it has been suggested to combine several samples and jointly measure them in a sample pool. While saving cost and labour at first sight, pooling efficiency depends on the pool size and the presently experienced prevalence of positive samples. Here we address the question of the optimum pool size at a given prevalence. We demonstrate the relation between analytical effort and pool size and delineate the effects of the target prevalence on the optimum pool size. Finally, we derive a simple-to-use formula and table that allow laboratories performing sample pooling to assess the optimum pool size at the currently experienced target prevalence rate."
3267,Guidelines for COVID-19 Management in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Recipients.,"There are currently limited data on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and optimal management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hematopoietic cell transplantation and cellular therapy recipients. Given the experience with other respiratory viruses, we anticipate that patients may develop severe clinical disease and thus provide the following general principles for cancer centers across the nation. These guidelines were developed by members of the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Infectious Diseases Special Interest Group. Specific practices may vary depending on local epidemiology and testing capacity, and the guidance provided in this document may change as new information becomes available."
3268,SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies and Associated Factors at Different Hospitalization Time Points in 192 COVID-19 Cases.,"Background: We launched a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 192 patients with COVID-19, aiming to depict the kinetic profile of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and explore the factors related to SARS-CoV-2 antibody expression. Methods: Data on 192 confirmed patients with COVID-19 between January and February 2020 was collected from the designated hospital that received patients with COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China. Moreover, a cohort of 130 suspected patients with COVID-19 and 209 healthy people were also enrolled in this study. IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected by the chemiluminescence immunoassay kits in different groups. Results: A total of 192 COVID-19 cases were analyzed, of which had 81.8% anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM detected and 93.2% anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG detected, respectively, at the time of sampling. The kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG showed that, the confirmed cases had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM seroconversion occurred 5-10 days after the onset of the symptoms, and then IgM rose rapidly to reach a peak within around 2-3 weeks, maintaining at its peak for 1 week before its decline. While they had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion simultaneously or sequentially with IgM, reaching its peak within around 3 to 4 weeks and began to decline after the fifth week. Besides, correlation analysis showed that in patients with COVID-19 the level of IgM was related to gender and disease severity (P < 0.01), and the level of IgG was related to age and disease severity (P < 0.001). The univariate analysis of relevant factors indicated that the level of IgG had a weak correlation with age (r = 0.374, P < 0.01). The level of IgM in male patients was higher than that in female patients (P < 0.001). The expression level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19 and the duration of the virus in the patients. Conclusion: The findings of this study show that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG can be important assisting COVID-19 diagnosis, especially in the early phase of infection. Furthermore, antibody expression in patients with COVID-19 is also correlated with disease severity, age, gender, and virus clearance or continuous replication."
