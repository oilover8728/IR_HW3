5051,"The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on Sperm Cryostorage, Theoretical or Real Risk?","Cryopreservation of human gametes and embryos as well as human reproductive tissues has been characterized as an essential process and aspect of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Notably, sperm cryopreservation is a fundamental aspect of cryopreservation in oncological patients or patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment. Given that there is a risk of contamination or cross-contamination, either theoretical or real, during the procedures of cryopreservation and cryostorage, both the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) have provided updated guidelines for preventing or reducing the contamination risk of sexually transmitted viruses. Given the ongoing and worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, there is considerable interest in what measures should be taken to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 contamination during cryopreservation and cryostorage of semen samples. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the virus that causes COVID-19, and whose transmission and infection is mainly aerosol-mediated. Several ART professional societies, including ESHRE and ASRM have proposed measures to mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Whether the proposed safety directives are enough to mitigate the possible SARS-CoV-2-contamination of sperm samples during cryopreservation or whether the policies should be re-evaluated will be discussed in this review. Additionally, insights regarding the possible impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the safety of sperm cryopreservation will be discussed."

5053,Severe reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in a nursing home resident: a case report.,"Background: The topic of natural immunity related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 remains controversial. Although evidence suggests postinfection immunity can be achieved, there have been reported cases of reinfection with similar or milder symptoms. Information on severe disease manifestation during reinfection is not known. We present a case of reinfection with a more severe presentation as compared with the initial infection. Case report: We describe a white male patient from a nursing home who was reinfected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with severe disease manifesting as dyspnea, fevers, and encephalopathy with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation, elevated inflammatory markers, and lung infiltrates on imaging, after initially testing positive with mild symptoms 2 months prior to presentation. Notably, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies were detected, which indicated this was a coronavirus disease 2019 reinfection. After treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, he was subsequently extubated and discharged home after 2 weeks. Conclusion: It is not clear whether an initial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and recovery provides prolonged immunity beyond 2 months. Furthermore, even if antibodies are present, it does not guarantee an attenuated course during reinfection. Therefore, vaccination plays an important role in prevention. Long-term cohort studies will be needed to study the factors behind reinfection."

5055,SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein vaccine candidate NVX-CoV2373 immunogenicity in baboons and protection in mice.,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the world with an urgent need for a safe and protective vaccine to effectuate herd protection and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report the development of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) from the full-length spike (S) protein that is stable in the prefusion conformation. NVX-CoV2373 S form 27.2-nm nanoparticles that are thermostable and bind with high affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. In mice, low-dose NVX-CoV2373 with saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant elicit high titer anti-S IgG that blocks hACE2 receptor binding, neutralize virus, and protects against SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. NVX-CoV2373 also elicits multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4+ follicular helper T cells (Tfh), and antigen-specific germinal center (GC) B cells in the spleen. In baboons, low-dose levels of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M was also highly immunogenic and elicited high titer anti-S antibodies and functional antibodies that block S-protein binding to hACE2 and neutralize virus infection and antigen-specific T cells. These results support the ongoing phase 1/2 clinical evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M (NCT04368988)."
5056,Transparency of the national government as key in promoting the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.,"A recent correspondence discussed two important attributes of the government officials, namely, public service and common good. These two could possibly help the government in terms of promoting vaccination programs in the Philippines. This paper proposes transparency as the third attribute that could help in gaining trust from the people in promoting vaccination in the country."
5057,Changes in general practitioners' attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination after first interim results: a longitudinal approach in France.,"We assessed whether the a priori acceptance by French general practitioners (GPs) of COVID-19 vaccines changed after the announcements about them in November 2020. In all, between two surveys in October-November and in November-December 2020, acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines increased among 16.9% of GPs and decreased among 23.0%. Among those with high acceptance in October-November (52.5%), 11.6% became hesitant-reluctant in November-December; in those with initial hesitancy-reluctance (24.6%), 15.2% showed high acceptance. Deteriorating acceptance was significantly associated with GPs' distrust in the Ministry of Health and a priori concerns about the safety of vaccines developed during an epidemic; the reverse was found for improving acceptance. In addition, better acceptance was more likely among GPs who perceived the medical severity of COVID-19 to be high and was less common among women. During a severe pandemic, GPs' trust in health institutions and perception of safety issues remain important predictors of their attitudes toward new vaccines. Vigilance is needed regarding health professionals' reactions to events that may cast doubt on the safety or efficacy of certain COVID-19 vaccines. Personalized approaches should be considered and tested to address their concerns as the situation and knowledge evolve."
5058,COVID-19 diagnosis and severity detection from CT-images using transfer learning and back propagation neural network.,"Background: COVID-19 diagnosis in symptomatic patients is an important factor for arranging the necessary lifesaving facilities like ICU care and ventilator support. For this purpose, we designed a computer-aided diagnosis and severity detection method by using transfer learning and a back propagation neural network. Method: To increase the learning capability, we used data augmentation. Most of the previously done works in this area concentrate on private datasets, but we used two publicly available datasets. The first section diagnose COVID-19 from the input CT image using the transfer learning of the pre-trained network ResNet-50. We used ResNet-50 and DenseNet-201 pre-trained networks for feature extraction and trained a back propagation neural network to classify it into High, Medium, and Low severity. Results: The proposed method for COVID-19 diagnosis gave an accuracy of 98.5% compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental evaluation shows that combining the ResNet-50 and DenseNet-201 features gave more accurate results with the test data. The proposed system for COVID-19 severity detection gave better average classification accuracy of 97.84% compared with the state-of-the-art methods. This enables medical practitioners to identify the resources and treatment plans correctly. Conclusions: This work is useful in the medical field as a first-line severity risk detection that is helpful for medical personnel to plan patient care and assess the need for ICU facilities and ventilator support. A computer-aided system that is helpful to make a care plan for the huge amount of patient inflow each day is sure to be an asset in these turbulent times."
5059,A cluster randomized trial of interferon ss-1a for the reduction of transmission of SARS-Cov-2: protocol for the Containing Coronavirus Disease 19 trial (ConCorD-19).,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly spreads in populations due to the high rates of community transmission. Interrupting the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 may reduce the incidence of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). Herein we provide a protocol for a cluster randomized trial that will examine the effectiveness of treatment with interferon (IFN) ß-1a compared to standard of care in limiting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Co-primary objectives are to determine whether IFN therapy reduces (a) the proportion of infected cases shedding SARS-CoV-2 at day 11 post randomization and (b) the incidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from index cases to treatment-eligible household post-exposure contacts at day 11 after randomization. Secondary objectives include assessing the impact of IFN treatment on duration of viral clearance, hospitalizations and fatalities, and evaluating the safety of IFN treatment. Methods: Three hundred and ten households, each including an index case with a recent COVID-19 diagnosis and at least one asymptomatic treatment-eligible household contact, will be randomized to receive 3 doses of 125 μg IFN ß-1a by subcutaneous administration (days 1, 6, and 11), or standard of care. All participants will be followed until day 29. Discussion: The results from this trial will identify whether IFN ß treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 cases accelerates viral clearance and prevents disease progression and whether IFN ß treatment of post-exposure contacts of COVID-19 cases reduces transmission of infection. Trial registration: This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04552379; date of registration September 17, 2020."
