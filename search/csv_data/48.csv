470,Accuracy of novel antigen rapid diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2: A living systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are increasingly being integrated in testing strategies around the world. Studies of the Ag-RDTs have shown variable performance. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the clinical accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of commercially available Ag-RDTs. Methods and findings: We registered the review on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020225140). We systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, medRvix, bioRvix, and FIND) for publications evaluating the accuracy of Ag-RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 up until 30 April 2021. Descriptive analyses of all studies were performed, and when more than 4 studies were available, a random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity in comparison to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. We assessed heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, and rated study quality and risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. From a total of 14,254 articles, we included 133 analytical and clinical studies resulting in 214 clinical accuracy datasets with 112,323 samples. Across all meta-analyzed samples, the pooled Ag-RDT sensitivity and specificity were 71.2% (95% CI 68.2% to 74.0%) and 98.9% (95% CI 98.6% to 99.1%), respectively. Sensitivity increased to 76.3% (95% CI 73.1% to 79.2%) if analysis was restricted to studies that followed the Ag-RDT manufacturers' instructions. LumiraDx showed the highest sensitivity, with 88.2% (95% CI 59.0% to 97.5%). Of instrument-free Ag-RDTs, Standard Q nasal performed best, with 80.2% sensitivity (95% CI 70.3% to 87.4%). Across all Ag-RDTs, sensitivity was markedly better on samples with lower RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, i.e., <20 (96.5%, 95% CI 92.6% to 98.4%) and <25 (95.8%, 95% CI 92.3% to 97.8%), in comparison to those with Ct ≥ 25 (50.7%, 95% CI 35.6% to 65.8%) and ≥30 (20.9%, 95% CI 12.5% to 32.8%). Testing in the first week from symptom onset resulted in substantially higher sensitivity (83.8%, 95% CI 76.3% to 89.2%) compared to testing after 1 week (61.5%, 95% CI 52.2% to 70.0%). The best Ag-RDT sensitivity was found with anterior nasal sampling (75.5%, 95% CI 70.4% to 79.9%), in comparison to other sample types (e.g., nasopharyngeal, 71.6%, 95% CI 68.1% to 74.9%), although CIs were overlapping. Concerns of bias were raised across all datasets, and financial support from the manufacturer was reported in 24.1% of datasets. Our analysis was limited by the included studies' heterogeneity in design and reporting. Conclusions: In this study we found that Ag-RDTs detect the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons within the first week of symptom onset and those with high viral load. Thus, they can have high utility for diagnostic purposes in the early phase of disease, making them a valuable tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Standardization in conduct and reporting of clinical accuracy studies would improve comparability and use of data."
471,Epitope mapping of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus nucleocapsid protein with a rabbit monoclonal antibody.,"The emergency SARS-CoV-2, a member of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV), is still greatly harming the health of mankind. SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), which can identify SARS-CoV-2 from common human coronaviruses, are considered to extensively apply to developing rapid and reliable antigen assays. In this study we generated a rabbit MAb (RAb) detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP), which has cross-reaction with SARS-CoV-1 NP, but not with NPs of MERS and common human CoVs (OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1). With truncated NP fragments and synthesized peptides, the linear epitope detected by RAb was mapped in peptide N4-8, 393-407 amino acid residue (TLLPAADLDDFSKQL) of SARS-CoV-2 NP. This epitope N4-8 was highly conserved in SARSr-CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and bat CoV RaTG13 strain. However, the corresponding peptide of bat SARSr-CoV BtKY72 strain could not be recognized by RAb, which indicates amino acid D399 may be critical for N4-8 epitope detected by RAb. The present study will be conducive to developing reliable diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 and gaining insights into the function of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein."
472,Novel RT-ddPCR assays for simultaneous quantification of multiple noncoding and coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.,"A hallmark of coronavirus transcription is the generation of negative-sense RNA intermediates that serve as the templates for the synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA) and an array of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) encompassing sequences arising from discontinuous transcription. Existing PCR-based diagnostic assays for SAR-CoV-2 are qualitative or semi-quantitative and do not provide the resolution needed to assess the complex transcription dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of infection. We developed and validated a novel panel of sensitive, quantitative RT-ddPCR assays designed to target regions spanning the genome of SARS-CoV-2. Our assays target untranslated regions (5', 3') as well as different coding regions, including non-structural genes that are only found in full length (genomic) RNA and structural genes that are found in genomic as well as different subgenomic RNAs. Application of these assays to clinically relevant samples will enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 gene expression and may also inform the development of improved diagnostic tools and therapeutics."
473,"Detection of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in five SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests (RATs), Germany, March 2021.","SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) should not escape molecular surveillance. We investigated if SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests (RATs) could detect B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VOCs in certain laboratory conditions. Infectious cell culture supernatants containing B.1.1.7, B.1.351 or non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 were respectively diluted both in DMEM and saliva. Dilutions were analysed with Roche, Siemens, Abbott, nal von minden and RapiGEN RATs. While further studies with appropriate real-life clinical samples are warranted, all RATs detected B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, generally comparable to non-VOC strain."
474,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Antibodies in Neonatal Cord Blood After Vaccination in Pregnancy.,"Background: Studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of currently available vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) do not include pregnant participants. No data are available to counsel on vaccine safety and potential for neonatal passive immunity. Case: A 34-year-old multigravid patient working in health care received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester of pregnancy. Uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery of a female neonate with Apgar scores of 9 and 9 occurred at term. The patient's blood as well as neonatal cord blood were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Both the patient and the neonate were positive for antibodies at a titer of 1:25,600. Conclusion: In this case, passage of transplacental antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 was shown after vaccination in the third trimester of pregnancy."
475,"Saliva Pooling Strategy for the Large-Scale Detection of SARS-CoV-2, Through Working-Groups Testing of Asymptomatic Subjects for Potential Applications in Different Workplaces.","Objective: To perform an improved large-scale SARS-CoV-2 detection on pooled tests of asymptomatic workers. Methods: qRT-PCR validation of the SARS-CoV-2 detection in salivae samples and saliva pools and working-group saliva pooling and testing for SARS-CoV-2. Results: We found a high Cycle threshold correlation (r = 0.9099) between swabs and saliva samples. Then, through the pooling strategy, we detected that 18/360 (5%) of individual saliva samples were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Saliva-pooling efficiency (360 of test sample/30 individual PCR) was higher (5.45) than the reported for swabbing group-testing and we spared 82% of the PCR reagents as well as sampling and personal protection equipment. Conclusion: Through this simplified and less expensive procedure, we detected in a short time asymptomatic-infected SARS-CoV-2-carriers that were isolated from their co-workers, thus, this methodology can be implemented in different workplaces to ensure consumers that employees are not infectious."
476,Clinical validation of an automated reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR assay for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.,"To determine clinical performance of the single-target SARS-CoV-2 orf 1 ab reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay, the positive percentage agreement between this assay and a laboratory real-time RT-PCR assay was 96.8% (30 of 31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 90.5%-100%) and the negative percentage agreement was 97.1% (67 of 69; 95% CI, 93.1%-100%)."
477,Evaluation of sample pooling for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swabs and salivas on the Roche Cobas 6800.,"The Roche Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test recently received an Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration UA for pooling of up to six nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPS). We evaluated the 6-pool approach on both NPS and saliva samples using 564 samples (20 positive NPS and saliva samples each and 262 negative NPS and saliva samples each). The sensitivity of the Roche SARS-CoV-2 RNA test for pooled NPS samples was 100 % (95 %CI: 83.2-100 %) and the sensitivity for pooled saliva samples was 90 % (95 % CI: 68.3-98.8 %). Given the high throughput of the Roche Cobas 6800, pooling of 6 samples has the potential to significantly increase testing capacity without significant loss in sensitivity."
478,Serological response in health care workers after a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine using six automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays.,"Spike (S)- and nucleocapsid (N)-specific serological assay responses were determined before and/or after first dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in 22 individuals. S-specific assays quantified antibodies after vaccination with significant higher levels in participants with a previous infection. Be cautious combining N-/S-specific assay results, potentially differentiating post-infection/vaccination immunization as assay-specific N-antibody waning was observed."
479,Handling and accuracy of four rapid antigen tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 compared to RT-qPCR.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics is facing material shortages and long turnaround times due to exponential increase of testing demand. Objective: We evaluated the analytic performance and handling of four rapid Antigen Point of Care Tests (AgPOCTs) I-IV (Distributors: (I) Roche, (II) Abbott, (III) MEDsan and (IV) Siemens). Methods: 100 RT-PCR negative and 84 RT-PCR positive oropharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and used to determine performance and accuracy of these AgPOCTs. Handling was evaluated by 10 healthcare workers/users through a questionnaire. Results: The median duration from symptom onset to sampling was 6 days (IQR 2-12 days). The overall respective sensitivity were 49.4 % (CI95 %: 38.9-59.9), 44.6 % (CI95 %: 34.3-55.3), 45.8 % (CI95 %: 35.5-56.5) and 54.9 % (CI95 %: 43.4-65.9) for tests I, II, III and IV, respectively. In the high viral load subgroup (containing >106 copies of SARS-CoV-2 /swab, n = 26), AgPOCTs reached sensitivities of 92.3 % or more (range 92.3 %-100 %). Specificity was 100 % for tests I, II (CI95 %: 96.3-100 for both tests) and IV (CI95 %: 96.3-100) and 97 % (CI95 %: 91.5-98.9) for test III. Regarding handling, test I obtained the overall highest scores, while test II was considered to have the most convenient components. Of note, users considered all assays, with the exception of test I, to pose a significant risk for contamination by drips or spills. Discussion: Besides some differences in sensitivity and handling, all four AgPOCTs showed acceptable performance in high viral load samples. However, due to the significantly lower sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, a careful consideration of pro and cons of AgPOCT has to be taken into account before clinical implementation."
