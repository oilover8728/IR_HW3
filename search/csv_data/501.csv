5001,[Interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis in imported COVID-19 cases and factors contributing to delayed diagnosis in Guangdong Province].,"Objective: To understand the distribution patterns and the factors influencing the interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis in imported COVID-19 cases in Guangdong Province to provide evidence for formulating and implementing effective control measures. Methods: We collected the data of imported COVID-19 cases from March 1st to April 10th, 2020 published on the official websites of Health Commission of Guangdong Province and local government of the cities in Guangdong Province for epidemiological analysis. Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze the distribution patterns of the interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis of the imported cases, and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the factors influencing the interval. Results: A total of 179 imported cases were reported in Guangdong by April 10th, 2020. The average interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis was 4.21 days with a median of 2 days. The interval was between 1 and 3 days in 69.8% of the cases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a negative result of the initial nucleic acid test (OR=5.205, 95% CI: 1.100-24.640, P=0.038) and interval between entry of mainland China and a positive diagnosis &gt;2 days (OR=85.654, 95%CI: 24.569-298.615, P &lt; 0.001) were risk factors for the finding delay. Conclusions: The results of initial nucleic acid detection and the interval between entry of mainland China and a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 are the major contributing factors of delayed case detection. This finding suggests that strict quarantine and detection measures should be carried out for the personnel entering China to accurately and quickly identify the cases."
5002,Prospects of COVID-19 Vaccination in Romania: Challenges and Potential Solutions.,"The rapid advancement in vaccine development represents a critical milestone that will help humanity tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the success of these efforts is not guaranteed, as it relies on the outcomes of national and international vaccination strategies. In this article, we highlight some of the challenges that Romania will face and propose a set of solutions to overcome them. With this in mind, we discuss issues such as the infrastructure of vaccine storage and delivery, the deployment and administration of immunisations, and the public acceptance of vaccines. The ways in which Romanian society will respond to a national COVID-19 vaccination campaign will be contingent on appropriate and timely actions. As many of the problems encountered in Romania are not unique, the proposed recommendations could be adapted and implemented in other countries that face similar issues, thereby informing better practices in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic."
5003,A study to design minimum data set of COVID-19 registry system.,"Background: From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of infrastructures to record, collect and report COVID-19‏ ‏data has become a fundamental necessity in the world. The disease registry system can help build an infrastructure to collect data systematically. The study aimed to design a minimum data set for the COVID-19 registry system. Methods: A qualitative study to design an MDS for the COVID-19 registry system was performed in five phases at Ahvaz University of Medical Sciences in Khuzestan Province in southwestern Iran, 2020-2021. In the first phase, assessing the information requirements was performed for the COVID-19 registry system. Data elements were identified in the second phase. In the third phase, the MDS was selected, and in the four phases, the COVID-19 registry system was implemented as a pilot study to test the MDS. Finally, based on the experiences gained from the COVID-19 registry system implementation, the MDS were evaluated, and corrections were made. Results: MDS of the COVID-19 registry system contains eight top groups including administrative (34 data elements), disease exposure (61 data elements), medical history and physical examination (138 data elements), findings of clinical diagnostic tests (101 data elements), disease progress and outcome of treatment (55 data elements), medical diagnosis and cause of death (12 data elements), follow-up (14 data elements), and COVID-19 vaccination (19 data elements) data, respectively. Conclusion: Creating a standard and comprehensive MDS can help to design any national data dictionary for COVID-19 and improve the quality of COVID-19 data."
5004,Point-of-care lung ultrasound in the diagnosis and monitoring of paediatric patients with spontaneous pneumothorax in SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Point-of-care lung ultrasound is a widely used tool in the diagnosis and management of patients with pulmonary diseases and now with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We describe two cases of pneumothorax which are, as far as we know, among the first reported in COVID-19 patients younger than 18 years. The diagnostic and monitoring role of point-of-care lung ultrasound has been extremely useful in the management of patients."
5005,Does Universal Testing for COVID-19 Work for Everyone?,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been especially devastating among nursing home residents, with both the health circumstances of individual residents as well as communal living settings contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Preventing the spread of COVID-19 infection requires a multipronged approach that includes early identification of infected residents and health care personnel, compliance with infection prevention and control measures, cohorting infected residents, and furlough of infected staff. Strategies to address COVID-19 infections among nursing home residents vary based on the availability for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests, the incorporation of tests into broader surveillance efforts, and using results to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by identifying asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections. We review the tests available to diagnose COVID-19 infections, the implications of universal testing for nursing home staff and residents, interpretation of test results, issues around repeat testing, and incorporation of test results as part of a long-term response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a structured approach for facility-wide testing of residents and staff and provide alternatives if testing capacity is limited, emphasizing contact tracing. Nursing homes with strong screening protocols for residents and staff, that engage in contact tracing for new cases, and that continue to remain vigilant about infection prevent and control practices, may better serve their residents and staff by thoughtful use of symptom- and risk-based testing strategies."
5006,"Individual and social determinants of SARS-CoV-2 testing and positivity in Ontario, Canada: a population-wide study.","Background: Optimizing the public health response to reduce the burden of COVID-19 necessitates characterizing population-level heterogeneity of risks for the disease. However, heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 testing may introduce biased estimates depending on analytic design. We aimed to explore the potential for collider bias in a large study of disease determinants, and evaluate individual, environmental and social determinants associated with SARS-CoV-2 testing and diagnosis among residents of Ontario, Canada. Methods: We explored the potential for collider bias and characterized individual, environmental and social determinants of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using cross-sectional analyses among 14.7 million community-dwelling people in Ontario, Canada. Among those with a diagnosis, we used separate analytic designs to compare predictors of people testing positive versus negative; symptomatic people testing positive versus testing negative; and people testing positive versus people not testing positive (i.e., testing negative or not being tested). Our analyses included tests conducted between Mar. 1 and June 20, 2020. Results: Of 14 695 579 people, we found that 758 691 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 25 030 (3.3%) had a positive test result. The further the odds of testing from the null, the more variability we generally observed in the odds of diagnosis across analytic design, particularly among individual factors. We found that there was less variability in testing by social determinants across analytic designs. Residing in areas with the highest household density (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75-1.98), highest proportion of essential workers (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.48-1.69), lowest educational attainment (adjusted OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26-1.41) and highest proportion of recent immigrants (adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15) were consistently related to increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis regardless of analytic design. Interpretation: Where testing is limited, our results suggest that risk factors may be better estimated using population comparators rather than test-negative comparators. Optimizing COVID-19 responses necessitates investment in and sufficient coverage of structural interventions tailored to heterogeneity in social determinants of risk, including household crowding, occupation and structural racism."

5009,"COVID-19: disease, or no disease? - that is the question. It's the dose stupid!","The COVID-19 pandemic has raised many issues not the least of which is the reason for its high variability in consequences to the infected person. In this opinion letter, we advocate that the dose and presentation of the infecting virus is a major factor that affects whether the outcome is subclinical, tissue damaging or even lethal following infection. We briefly describe the known effects of virus dose on the course COVID-19 and discuss practical maneuvers as well as largely untested procedures that can raise the threshold dose needed to break through barriers of resistance."
