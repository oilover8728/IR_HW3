4230,Effectiveness of Covid-19 Vaccines against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant.,"Background: The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has contributed to a surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the United Kingdom. The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear. Methods: We used a test-negative case-control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients' vaccination status. Results: Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant. With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant. Conclusions: Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose. This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations. (Funded by Public Health England.)."
4231,Predictors of COVID-19 testing rates: A cross-country comparison.,"Objectives: Cross-country comparisons of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have largely been applied to mortality analyses. The goal of this analysis is to explore predictors of COVID-19 testing through cross-country comparisons, to better inform international health policies. Methods: Testing and case-based data were amassed from Our World in Data, and information regarding predictors was gathered from the World Bank. We investigate Human Development Index (HDI), health expenditure, universal health coverage (UHC), urban population, service industry workers (%), and air pollution as predictors. We explored testing data through July 31, 2020, or most recently available, using case-indexing methods, which involve synchronizing countries by date of first reported COVID-19 case as an index date and normalizing to the cumulative tests 25 days post-index date. Three multivariable linear regression models were built in a stepwise fashion to explore the association between the indexed number of COVID-19 tests and HDI scores. Results: A total of 86 countries were included in the final analytical sample, excluding countries with missing data. HDI and urban population were found to be significantly associated with testing levels. Conclusions: Results suggest that social conditions and government capacity remain consistently salient in the consideration of testing rates. International efforts to assist low-HDI countries are needed to support the global COVID-19 response."
4232,Novel method for quantifying cells on carriers and its demonstration during SARS-2 vaccine development.,"The most effective way to prevent and control infectious disease outbreak is through vaccines. The increasing use of vaccines has elevated the need to establish new manufacturing strategies. One of the major approaches is cell-based production, which creates a need for high cell density to enable higher cell production levels. This has led to development of the technology of cell carriers, including micro and macro cell carriers. To follow the production process, quantifying the number of cells on these carriers is required, as well as the tracking of their viability and proliferation. However, owing to various carriers' unique structures, tracking the cell's is challenging using current traditional assays that were originally developed for monolayers of adherent cells. The current ""gold standard"" method is counting cell nuclei, separating cells from the carrier, staining with crystal violet, and visually counting under a microscope. This method is tedious and counts both live and dead cells. A few other techniques were developed but were specific to the carrier type and involved specialized equipment. In this study, we describe a broadly ranging method for counting cells on carriers that was developed and employed as part of the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine. The method is based on the Alamar blue dye, a well-known, common marker for cell activity, and was found to be successful in tracking cell adsorption, cell growth, and viability on carriers. No separation of the cells from the carriers is needed, nor is any specialized equipment; the method is simple and rapid and provides comprehensive details necessary for process control of viral vaccine production in cells. This method can be easily implemented in any of a number of cell-based processes and other unique platforms for measuring the growth of encapsulated cells."
4233,Impact of Preinfection Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction on Outcomes in COVID-19 Infection.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has high infectivity and causes extensive morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular disease is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19, but baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in particular has not been evaluated thoroughly in this context. We analyzed patients in our state's largest health system who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 20 and May 15, 2020. Inclusion required an available echocardiogram within 1 year prior to diagnosis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. LVEF was analyzed both as a continuous variable and using a cutoff of 40%. Among 396 patients (67 ± 16 years, 191 [48%] male, 235 [59%] Black, 59 [15%] LVEF ≤40%), 289 (73%) required hospital admission, and 116 (29%) died during 85 ± 63 days of follow-up. Echocardiograms, performed a median of 57 (IQR 11-122) days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, showed a similar distribution of LVEF between survivors and decedents (P = 0.84). Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed no predictive ability of LVEF for mortality, and there was no difference in survival among those with LVEF ≤40% versus >40% (P = 0.49). Multivariable analysis did not change these relationships. Similarly, there was no difference in LVEF based on whether the patient required hospital admission (56 ± 13 vs 55 ± 13, P = 0.38), and patients with a depressed LVEF did not require admission more frequently than their preserved-LVEF peers (P = 0.87). A premorbid history of dyspnea consistent with symptomatic heart failure was not associated with mortality (P = 0.74). Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, pre-COVID-19 LVEF was not a risk factor for death or hospitalization."

4235,Epitope based peptide vaccine against SARS-COV2: an immune-informatics approach.,"World is witnessing exponential growth of SARS-CoV2 and fatal outcomes of COVID 19 has proved its pandemic potential already by claiming more than 3 lakhs deaths globally. If not controlled, this ongoing pandemic can cause irreparable socio-economic and psychological impact worldwide. Therefore a safe and effective vaccine against COVID 19 is exigent. Recent advances in immunoinformatics approaches could potentially decline the attrition rate and accelerate the process of vaccine development in these unprecedented times. In the present study, a multivalent subunit vaccine targeting S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV2 S glycoprotein has been designed using open source, immunoinformatics tools. Designed construct comprises of epitopes capable of inducing T cell, B cell (Linear and discontinuous) and Interferon γ. physiologically, vaccine construct is predicted to be thermostable, antigenic, immunogenic, non allergen and non toxic in nature. According to population coverage analysis, designed multiepitope vaccine covers 99.26% population globally. 3D structure of vaccine construct was designed, validated and refined to obtain high quality structure. Refined structure was docked against Toll like receptors to confirm the interactions between them. Vaccine peptide sequence was reverse transcribed, codon optimized and cloned in pET vector. Our in-silico study suggests that proposed vaccine against fusion domain of virus has the potential to elicit an innate as well as humoral immune response in human and restrict the entry of virus inside the cell. Results of the study offer a framework for in-vivo analysis that may hasten the process of development of therapeutic tools against COVID 19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
4236,Physicians' opinions on the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with epilepsy.,"The aim of the current study was to investigate the opinions of neurologists and psychiatrists in Iran on the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with epilepsy (PWE). These data can help policy makers understand the concerns of these healthcare professionals. This was a survey study. On September 1st, 2020 we sent a questionnaire (using Google-forms) to all neurologists and psychiatrists in Iran via WhatsApp. The survey included three general questions (age, sex, and discipline) and six COVID-specific questions. In total, 202 physicians participated in this study (116 neurologists and 86 psychiatrists). Of the participants, 27% believed that PWE are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. The majority (74%) of the participants would confidently recommend COVID-19 vaccine to their patients. However, only 49% of the physicians would recommend such a vaccine to all patients; others would consider it in special populations only. The overwhelming majority (91%) of the participants would recommend COVID-19 vaccine only when a reliable vaccine becomes available. Many physicians would trust a vaccine that is approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) (46%) or a vaccine that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA-USA) (34%). Physicians have concerns on the issue of the necessity of (a future) COVID-19 vaccine in PWE. The most important concern is the reliability of a vaccine and in this regard, two health agencies, the WHO and the FDA, are the most trusted organizations to approve a vaccine against COVID-19."
4237,A comparative review of immunoassays for COVID-19 detection.,"Introduction: The gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, time-consuming and may result in false-negative results. Serological tests can be employed for RT-PCR negative patients, contact tracing, determining the probability of protection against re-infection, and seroepidemiological studies.Areas covered: The main methodologies of serology-based tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) were reviewed and their diagnostic performances were compared. Herein, a literature review on the databases of PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar between January 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020 based on the main serological methods for COVID-19 detection with the focus on comparative experiments was performed. The review was updated on December 31, 2020.Expert opinion: Serology testing could be considered as a part of diagnostic panel two-week post symptom onset. Higher sensitivity for serology-based tests could be achieved by determining combined IgG/IgM titers. Furthermore, higher sensitive serological test detecting neutralization antibody could be developed by targeting spike (S) antigen. It was also demonstrated that the sensitivity of ELISA/CLIA-based methods are higher than LFIA devices."

4239,COVID19-CT-dataset: an open-access chest CT image repository of 1000+ patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Objectives: The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically impacted the global health and economy. Computed tomography (CT) is the prime imaging modality for diagnosis of lung infections in COVID-19 patients. Data-driven and Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions for automatic processing of CT images predominantly rely on large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. Owing to privacy and data availability issues, open-access and publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets are difficult to obtain, thus limiting the development of AI-enabled automatic diagnostic solutions. To tackle this problem, large CT image datasets encompassing diverse patterns of lung infections are in high demand. Data description: In the present study, we provide an open-source repository containing 1000+ CT images of COVID-19 lung infections established by a team of board-certified radiologists. CT images were acquired from two main general university hospitals in Mashhad, Iran from March 2020 until January 2021. COVID-19 infections were ratified with matching tests including Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and accompanying clinical symptoms. All data are 16-bit grayscale images composed of 512 × 512 pixels and are stored in DICOM standard. Patient privacy is preserved by removing all patient-specific information from image headers. Subsequently, all images corresponding to each patient are compressed and stored in RAR format."
