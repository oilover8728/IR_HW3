5060,"Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in Beijing's Xinfadi Market, China: a modeling study to inform future resurgence response.","Background: A local coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case confirmed on June 11, 2020 triggered an outbreak in Beijing, China after 56 consecutive days without a newly confirmed case. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were used to contain the source in Xinfadi (XFD) market. To rapidly control the outbreak, both traditional and newly introduced NPIs including large-scale management of high-risk populations and expanded severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR-based screening in the general population were conducted in Beijing. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing's XFD market and inform future response efforts of resurgence across regions. Methods: A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was developed and applied to evaluate a range of different scenarios from the public health perspective. Two outcomes were measured: magnitude of transmission (i.e., number of cases in the outbreak) and endpoint of transmission (i.e., date of containment). The outcomes of scenario evaluations were presented relative to the reality case (i.e., 368 cases in 34 days) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Results: Our results indicated that a 3 to 14 day delay in the identification of XFD as the infection source and initiation of NPIs would have caused a 3 to 28-fold increase in total case number (31-77 day delay in containment). A failure to implement the quarantine scheme employed in the XFD outbreak for defined key population would have caused a fivefold greater number of cases (73 day delay in containment). Similarly, failure to implement the quarantine plan executed in the XFD outbreak for close contacts would have caused twofold greater transmission (44 day delay in containment). Finally, failure to implement expanded nucleic acid screening in the general population would have yielded 1.6-fold greater transmission and a 32 day delay to containment. Conclusions: This study informs new evidence that in form the selection of NPI to use as countermeasures in response to a COVID-19 outbreak and optimal timing of their implementation. The evidence provided by this study should inform responses to future outbreaks of COVID-19 and future infectious disease outbreak preparedness efforts in China and elsewhere."
5061,"COVID-19 pandemic in Djibouti: Epidemiology and the response strategy followed to contain the virus during the first two months, 17 March to 16 May 2020.","First cases of COVID-19 were reported from Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and it progressed rapidly. On 30 January, WHO declared the new disease as a PHEIC, then as a Pandemic on 11 March. By mid-March, the virus spread widely; Djibouti was not spared and was hit by the pandemic with the first case detected on 17 March. Djibouti worked with WHO and other partners to develop a preparedness and response plan, and implemented a series of intervention measures. MoH together with its civilian and military partners, closely followed WHO recommended strategy based on four pillars: testing, isolating, early case management, and contact tracing. From 17 March to 16 May, Djibouti performed the highest per capita tests in Africa and isolated, treated and traced the contacts of each positive case, which allowed for a rapid control of the epidemic. COVID-19 data included in this study was collected through MoH Djibouti during the period from 17 March to 16 May 2020. A total of 1,401 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were included in the study with 4 related deaths (CFR: 0.3%) and an attack rate of 0.15%. Males represented (68.4%) of the cases, with the age group 31-45 years old (34.2%) as the most affected. Djibouti conducted 17,532 tests, and was considered as a champion for COVID-19 testing in Africa with 18.2 tests per 1000 habitant. All positive cases were isolated, treated and had their contacts traced, which led to early and proactive diagnosis of cases and in turn yielded up to 95-98% asymptomatic cases. Recoveries reached 69% of the infected cases with R0 (0.91). The virus was detected in 4 regions in the country, with the highest percentage in the capital (83%). Djibouti responded to COVID-19 pandemic following an efficient and effective strategy, using a strong collaboration between civilian and military health assets that increased the response capacities of the country. Partnership, coordination, solidarity, proactivity and commitment were the pillars to confront COVID-19 pandemic."
5062,The ROMANOV study found impaired humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in virus-unexposed patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis.,"Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), which are at high risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus and death due to COVID-19, have been prioritized for vaccination. However, because they were excluded from pivotal studies and have weakened immune responses, it is not known whether these patients are protected after the ""standard"" two doses of mRNA vaccines. To answer this, anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and interferon gamma-producing CD4+ and CD8+ specific-T cells were measured in the circulation 10-14 days after the second injection of BNT162b2 vaccine in 106 patients receiving MHD (14 with history of COVID-19) and compared to 30 healthy volunteers (four with history of COVID-19). After vaccination, most (72/80, 90%) patients receiving MHD naïve for the virus generated at least one type of immune effector, but their response was weaker and less complete than that of healthy volunteers. In multivariate analysis, hemodialysis and immunosuppressive therapy were significantly associated with absence of both anti-RBD IgGs and anti-spike CD8+ T cells. In contrast, previous history of COVID-19 in patients receiving MHD correlated with the generation of both types of immune effectors anti-RBD IgG and anti-spike CD8+ T cells at levels similar to healthy volunteers. Patients receiving MHD naïve for SARS-Cov-2 generate mitigated immune responses after two doses of mRNA vaccine. Thus, the good response to vaccine of patients receiving MHD with a history of COVID-19 suggest that these patients may benefit from a third vaccine injection."

5064,"Factors That Shape People's Attitudes towards the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany-The Influence of MEDIA, Politics and Personal Characteristics.","Misinformation that accompanied the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to an impaired risk perception, resulting in the refusal of personal protection measures, as well as a reduced willingness to receive a vaccination. In order to identify factors that might influence people's attitudes towards COVID-19 policies and engagement in mitigation measures, we carried out a cross-sectional study in Germany. Altogether, n = 808 participants completed our questionnaire concerning items on demographics, media consumption, risk perception, and trust in health authorities, as well as willingness to receive a vaccination. An overwhelming majority of our participants perceived SARS-CoV-2 as a health threat (85.7%), and almost two thirds (63.5%) mentioned they would get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 when a vaccination was available. A greater likelihood of vaccination intention was associated with being male (71.5% male vs. 60% female, p < 0.05), left-wing voting, trusting health authorities, using public media as an information source about COVID-19, and, in particular, perceiving COVID-19 as a health threat. A better understanding of factors that contribute to vaccine hesitancy is indispensable in order to eliminate doubts, increase vaccination rates, and create herd immunity, to stop further virus transmission."
5065,COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance among Health Care Workers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.,"Objectives: The purpose of our study was to assess COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among health care workers (HCWs) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and identify: 1) vaccine acceptance barriers; 2) demographic differences; and 3) the most trusted COVID-19 sources of information. Methods: Between October and December 2020, all registered HCWs in the KSA were emailed a survey questionnaire, using Qualtrics® and Google Forms®, evaluating their acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Of the 23,582 participants surveyed, 15,299 (64.9%) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine acceptance among HCWs differed by several demographic characteristics, with males (69.7%), Christians (71.9%), and Pakistanis (81.6%) most likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Of the 8,202 (35.1%) who said they would not accept a COVID-19 vaccine, the main reason reported was fear of potential side effects (58.5%). Participants reported health officials (84.6%) as the most reliable source of COVID-19 information. Additionally, participants reported the highest confidence in the KSA Ministry of Health (88.5%). Conclusions: Overall, these findings provide KSA health care authorities with the information needed to develop public health messaging campaigns for HCWs to best address COVID-19 vaccine concerns-especially as the country prepares to vaccinate its general population."
5066,Use of Tofacitinib in the Context of COVID-19 Vaccination: Comment on the American College of Rheumatology Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Vaccination in Patients With Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases.,"We read with great interest the ACR’s COVID‐19 Vaccine Clinical Guidance Summary for Patients with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (1). We commend the Task Force’s emphasis on the importance of immunization in this population and for providing guidance to the rheumatology community. Regarding their recommendation to hold Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors for 1 week after each COVID‐19 vaccine dose (1), we propose the following available tofacitinib data for consideration in this context."
5067,"SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Hesitancy in a Sample of US Adults: Role of Perceived Satisfaction With Health, Access to Healthcare, and Attention to COVID-19 News.","Understanding which communities are most likely to be vaccine hesitant is necessary to increase vaccination rates to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This cross-sectional survey of adults (n = 501) from three cities in the United States (Miami, FL, New York City, NY, San Francisco, CA) assessed the role of satisfaction with health and healthcare access and consumption of COVID-19 news, previously un-studied variables related to vaccine hesitancy. Multilevel logistic regression tested the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and study variables. Thirteen percent indicated they would not get vaccinated. Black race (OR 2.6; 95% CI: 1.38-5.3), income (OR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.50-0.83), inattention to COVID-19 news (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1-2.5), satisfaction with health (OR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52-0.99), and healthcare access (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2-2.7) were associated with vaccine hesitancy. Public health officials should consider these variables when designing public health communication about the vaccine to ensure better uptake."
5068,"Background rates of all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits among nursing home residents in Ontario, Canada to inform COVID-19 vaccine safety assessments.","Background: Nursing home (NH) residents are prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination. We report monthly mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visit incidence rates (IRs) during 2010-2020 to provide context for COVID-19 vaccine safety assessments. Methods: We observed outcomes among all NH residents in Ontario using administrative databases. IRs were calculated by month, sex, and age group. Comparisons between months were assessed using one-sample t-tests; comparisons by age and sex were assessed using chi-squared tests. Results: From 2010 to 2019, there were 83,453 (SD: 652.4) NH residents per month, with an average of 2.3 (SD: 0.28) deaths, 3.1 (SD: 0.16) hospitalizations, and 3.6 (SD: 0.17) ED visits per 100 residents per month. From March to December 2020, mortality IRs were increased, but hospitalization and ED visit IRs were reduced (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We identified consistent monthly mortality, hospitalization, and ED visit IRs during 2010-2019. Marked differences in these rates were observed during 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic."
5069,An enveloped virus-like particle vaccine expressing a stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicits highly potent immunity.,"We evaluated enveloped virus-like particles (eVLPs) expressing various forms of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and several adjuvants in an effort to identify a highly potent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine candidate. eVLPs expressing a modified prefusion form of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were selected as they induced high antibody binding titers and neutralizing activity after a single injection in mice. Formulation of SARS-CoV-2 S eVLPs with aluminum phosphate resulted in balanced induction of IgG2 and IgG1 isotypes and antibody binding and neutralization titers were undiminished for more than 3 months after a single immunization. A single dose of this candidate, named VBI-2902a, protected Syrian golden hamsters from challenge with SARS-CoV-2 and supports the on-going clinical evaluation of VBI-2902a as a highly potent vaccine against COVID-19."
