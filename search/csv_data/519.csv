5180,A COVID-19 testing and triage algorithm for psychiatric units: One hospital's response to the New York region's pandemic.,"Psychiatric patients are at high risk for contracting COVID-19, and inpatient psychiatric units face substantial risks of institutional outbreaks. Here, the authors describe an algorithm for testing and triage in a large psychiatric facility designed to prevent local COVID-19 transmission. The algorithm is based on expert opinion and clinical experience between March and April of 2020, during which the institution cared for 47 COVID-19 positive psychiatric inpatients. The implementation of the algorithm is designed to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, preserve the safest and least restrictive treatment environment for psychiatric inpatients, and provide a model adaptable to other institutional settings."
5181,COVID-19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome in three teenagers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generally a relatively mild illness in children. An emerging disease entity coined as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) has been reported recently, but is very rare and only affects a very small minority of children. Here we describe the clinical presentations and outcomes of three teenagers with serologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit for PIMS-TS. Although their initial presentations were very similar, their COVID-19-related disease varied in severity."

5183,Laboratory diagnosis for Covid-19: A mini-review.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2. This disease was first identified in December 2019 and rapidly developed into a challenge to the public health systems around the world. In the absence of a vaccine and specific therapies, disease control and promotion of patient health are strongly dependent on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. This review describes the main laboratory approaches to making a diagnosis of COVID-19 and identifying those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2."
5184,A two minute liquid based sample preparation for rapid SARS-CoV2 real-time PCR screening: A multicentre evaluation.,"Background: Apart from major health concerns associated to the SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, also the diagnostic workflow encountered serious problems. Limited availability of kit components, buffers and even plastics has resulted in suboptimal testing procedures worldwide. Alternative workflows have been implemented to overcome these difficulties. Recently a liquid based sample prep has been launched as solution to overcome limitations in relation to nucleic acid extraction. Objective: Multicenter evaluation of the QIAprep&amp Viral RNA UM kit (QIA P&A) for rapid sample preparation and real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to standardized laboratory testing methods. Study design: Selected samples of the routine diagnostic workflow at Clinical Microbiology Laboratories of four Dutch hospitals have been subjected to the rapid QIA P&A protocol and the results have been compared to routine diagnostic data. Results: Combining results of manual and automated procedures, a total of 377 clinical samples of which 202 had been tested positive with a wide range of CT values, showed almost complete concordance in the QIA P&A assay for samples up to CT values of 33 with one exception of CT 31. Prospectively 60 samples were tested and also showed 100 % concordance with 5 positives. The method has been automated by two centres. Conclusions: Despite an input of only 8 Î¼L of clinical sample, the QIA P&A kit showed good performance for sample preparation and amplification of SARS-CoV-2 and can contribute as a rapid molecular testing strategy in managing the CoV-2 pandemic."
5185,Ethical Considerations in Vaccine Allocation.,"In an effort to establish a consensus position on the ethical principles and ideals that should guide vaccine allocation during the Covid-19 pandemic, various organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, released sample allocation frameworks to help guide government entities charged with distributing vaccine doses. One area of agreement among these reports is that front line health care workers, especially those who come into regular contact with Covid-19 patients, ought to be afforded highest priority. But this convergence, though significant, raises questions concerning the ethics of vaccine distribution among those highest-priority health care workers: If a hospital has inadequate supply to vaccinate its entire workforce, which of its essential workers should it prioritize? In this paper, we begin with a general overview of ethical questions of vaccine administration before narrowing our focus to some of the most pressing theoretical and practical issues hospital officials must face in building justifiable and actionable frameworks for vaccinating their workers. We discuss and assess some potential ambitions of hospital allocation plans, concentrating especially on the goal of protecting the community from catastrophic loss of life. Finally, we consider some specific questions hospitals will encounter when developing distribution guidelines that aim to realize this aspiration."
5186,Clinical performance of the Panbio assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients.,"Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, numerous serological tests have been developed, including rapid diagnostic tests. This study aims at assessing the clinical performance of the Panbio immunoglobulin G (IgG)/IgM coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test (Abbott), a rapid lateral flow assay for the qualitative detection of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2. One hundred and thirty-eight samples from 95 COVID-19 patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were analyzed to assess the clinical sensitivity. Seventy-six pre-COVID-19 samples were used to evaluate the clinical specificity. Two independent and blinded raters determined visually the presence or absence of the IgG, IgM, and control lines for each test after 10 and 20 min. The sensitivity obtained from collected samples more than 14 days after the onset of symptoms was 95.2% for IgG. IgM was less frequently detected (highest sensitivity of 20.5%). The specificities obtained were 98.7% and 100% for IgG and IgM, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity of the assay was better when the reading was performed at 20 min than at 10 min, whereas the specificity was unchanged. The Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test detects IgG with high sensitivity 14 days since symptom onset but presents a low sensitivity for IgM. The specificity was excellent for both IgG and IgM."
5187,[Antibody tests for COVID-19: What the results tell us].,"Introduction: In the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the detection of virus-specific antibodies (AB) will play an increasing role. The presence or absence of such antibodies can potentially lead to considerations regarding immunity and infection. Issue: How reliable are inferences from positive or negative test results regarding the actual presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies? Methods: Calculation of the probability that, depending on the pretest probability (prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection) and test properties, antibodies are present or absent in the case of positive or negative test results. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of different SARS-CoV-2 AB test systems vary between 53 % and 94 % and between 91 % and 99.5 %, respectively. When using a test with high test quality, the positive predictive value (PPV) is 42 % and 7 9%, respectively, with a pre-test probability of 1 % to 5 %, as can currently be assumed for the general population in Austria or Germany. For persons with an increased pre-test probability of 20 %, e. g. persons from high-risk professions, the PPW is 95 %, with a pre-test probability of 80 % the PPW is almost 100 %. The negative predictive value (NPV) is at least 99.7 % for persons with a low pre-test probability of up to 5 % and 79.1 % for persons with a pre-test probability of 80 %. When using test systems with lower sensitivity and specificity, the reliability of the results decreases considerably. The PPV is 5.9 % with a pre-test probability of 1 %. Conclusions: A sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity are prerequisites for the application of antibody test systems. Positive test results are often false if the pre-test probability is low. Depending on the assumed prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are substantial differences in the significance of a concrete test result for the respective affected persons."
5188,COVID-19: an update on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.,"The unexpected pandemic set off by the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused severe panic among people worldwide. COVID-19 has created havoc, and scientists and physicians are urged to test the efficiency and safety of drugs used to treat this disease. In such a pandemic situation, various steps have been taken by the government to control and prevent the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2). This pandemic situation has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures. COVID-19 treatment requires both limiting viral multiplication and neutralizing tissue damage induced by an inappropriate immune reaction. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective. As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus. This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). More research is required for further understanding of the influence of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19. [BMB Reports 2020; 53(4): 191-205]."
