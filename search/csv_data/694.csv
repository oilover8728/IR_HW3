6930,Herpes zoster might be an indicator for latent COVID 19 infection.,"Various cutaneous manifestations have been observed in patients with COVID-19 infection. Herpes zoster is a viral skin disease caused by varicella zoster that remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia of cutaneous nerves following a primary chicken pox infection. In this report, we describe two cases COVID infection who first presented with herpes zoster. We are here by suggesting that the clinical presentation of HZ at the time of the current pandemic even in patients giving mild or no suggestive history of upper respiratory symptoms should be considered as an alarming sign for a recent subclinical SARS CoV2 infection."
6931,"Detecting Rapid Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants, France, January 26-February 16, 2021.","Variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 raise concerns regarding the control of coronavirus disease epidemics. We analyzed 40,000 specific reverse transcription PCR tests performed on positive samples during January 26-February 16, 2021, in France. We found high transmission advantage of variants and more advanced spread than anticipated."
6932,Do Corticosteroid Injections for the Treatment of Pain Influence the Efficacy of Adenovirus Vector-Based COVID-19 Vaccines?,"Myth: Corticosteroid injection for the treatment of pain is known to decrease the efficacy of the adenovirus vector-based vaccines for COVID-19. Fact: There is currently no direct evidence to suggest that a corticosteroid injection before or after the administration of an adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine decreases the efficacy of the vaccine. However, based on the known timeline of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression following epidural and intraarticular corticosteroid injections, and the timeline of the reported peak efficacy of the Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines, physicians should consider timing an elective corticosteroid injection such that it is administered no less than 2 weeks prior to and no less than 2 weeks following a COVID-19 adenovirus vector-based vaccine dose, whenever possible. We emphasize the importance of risk/benefit analysis and shared decision making in determining the timing of corticosteroid injections for pain indications in relation to receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine given that patient-specific factors will vary."
6933,"[Sars-CoV-2, a new virus of the coronavirus family].","The world is facing the first viral pandemic of the 21st century. It is time, at the end of this first wave and in the core of the second, to take stock of what we have learned about this new virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, our difficulties and shortcomings, but also our successes in managing this major health crisis."
6934,Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy following COVID-19 vaccination: an increasing presentation to the two-week wait neck lump clinic?,The first COVID-19 vaccination was given in December 2020 and there is an effort to vaccinate the international population on a massive scale. Common side effects from the vaccine include headache and tiredness. Regional lymphadenopathy has been described in relation to other vaccines. We describe two cases of supraclavicular reactive lymphadenopathy presenting in patients who had the COVID vaccination in the ipsilateral arm. Awareness of this diagnosis is important for patients presenting to the neck lump clinic.
6935,Inverse Relationship of Maximal Exercise Capacity to Hospitalization Secondary to Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"Objective: To investigate the relationship between maximal exercise capacity measured before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and hospitalization due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: We identified patients (≥18 years) who completed a clinically indicated exercise stress test between January 1, 2016, and February 29, 2020, and had a test for SARS-CoV-2 (ie, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) between February 29, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Maximal exercise capacity was quantified in metabolic equivalents of task (METs). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the likelihood that hospitalization secondary to COVID-19 is related to peak METs, with adjustment for 13 covariates previously identified as associated with higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Results: We identified 246 patients (age, 59±12 years; 42% male; 75% black race) who had an exercise test and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among these, 89 (36%) were hospitalized. Peak METs were significantly lower (P<.001) among patients who were hospitalized (6.7±2.8) compared with those not hospitalized (8.0±2.4). Peak METs were inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization in unadjusted (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.92) and adjusted models (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99). Conclusion: Maximal exercise capacity is independently and inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19. These data further support the important relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and health outcomes. Future studies are needed to determine whether improving maximal exercise capacity is associated with lower risk of complications due to viral infections, such as COVID-19."
6936,Facing the COVID-19 pandemic inside maternities in Brazil: A mixed-method study within the REBRACO initiative.,"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic posed major challenges in obstetric health care services. Preparedness, development, and implementation of new protocols were part of the needed response. This study aims to describe the strategies implemented and the perspectives of health managers on the challenges to face the pandemic in 16 different maternity hospitals that comprise a multicenter study in Brazil, called REBRACO (Brazilian network of COVID-19 during pregnancy). Methods: Mixed-method study, with quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data on the infrastructure of the units, maternal and perinatal health indicators, modifications on staff and human resources, from January to July/2020. Also, information on total number of cases, and availability for COVID-19 testing. A qualitative study by purposeful and saturation sampling was undertaken with healthcare managers, to understand perspectives on local challenges in facing the pandemic. Results: Most maternities early implemented their contingency plan. REBRACO centers reported 338 confirmed COVID-19 cases among pregnant and post-partum women up to July 2020. There were 29 maternal deaths and 15 (51.8%) attributed to COVID-19. All maternities performed relocation of beds designated to labor ward, most (75%) acquired mechanical ventilators, only the minority (25%) installed new negative air pressure rooms. Considering human resources, around 40% hired extra health professionals and increased weekly workload and the majority (68.7%) also suspended annual leaves. Only one center implemented universal screening for childbirth and 6 (37.5%) implemented COVID-19 testing for all suspected cases, while around 60% of the centers only tested moderate/severe cases with hospital admission. Qualitative results showed that main challenges experienced were related to the fear of the virus, concerns about reliability of evidence and lack of resources, with a clear need for mental health support among health professionals. Conclusion: Study findings suggest that maternities of the REBRACO initiative underwent major changes in facing the pandemic, with limitations on testing, difficulties in infrastructure and human resources. Leadership, continuous training, implementation of evidence-based protocols and collaborative initiatives are key to transpose the fear of the virus and ascertain adequate healthcare inside maternities, especially in low and middle-income settings. Policy makers need to address the specificities in considering reproductive health and childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic and prioritize research and timely testing availability."
6937,Secondary immune thrombocytopenia supposedly attributable to COVID-19 vaccination.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been widely reported as a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but to our knowledge, there have been no reports on the association of the COVID-19 vaccine with thrombocytopenia. Here, we report a case of secondary ITP in a patient who was recently immunised with the messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)."

6939,Clinical evidence of an interferon-glucocorticoid therapeutic synergy in COVID-19.,"Synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone is the first trial-proven drug that reduces COVID-19 mortality by suppressing immune system. In contrast, interferons are a crucial component of host antiviral immunity and can be directly suppressed by glucocorticoids. To investigate whether therapeutic interferons can compensate glucocorticoids-induced loss of antiviral immunity, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 387 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with quasi-random exposure to interferons and conditional exposure to glucocorticoids. Among patients receiving glucocorticoids, early interferon therapy was associated with earlier hospital discharge (adjusted HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.19-2.37) and symptom relief (adjusted HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06-2.08), while these associations were insignificant among glucocorticoids nonusers. Early interferon therapy was also associated with lower prevalence of prolonged viral shedding (adjusted OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.57) only among glucocorticoids users. Additionally, these associations were glucocorticoid cumulative dose- and timing-dependent. These findings reveal potential therapeutic synergy between interferons and glucocorticoids in COVID-19 that warrants further investigation."
