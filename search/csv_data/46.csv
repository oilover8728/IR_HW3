452,Highlighted Prospects of an IgM/IgG Antibodies Test in Identifying Individuals With Asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection.,"Context.—: Covert severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections could be seeding new outbreaks. How to identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections early has become a global focus. Objective.—: To explore the roles of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies detection, nucleic acid tests, and computed tomography (CT) scanning to identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design.—: The clinical data of 389 individuals with close contacts, including in general characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 etiology, serum-specific IgM and IgG antibody detection and CT imaging results, were systematically analyzed. Results.—: The present study showed that only 89 of 389 individuals with close contacts were positive after the first nucleic acid test, while 300 individuals were still negative after 2 nucleic acid tests. Among the 300 individuals, 75 did not have pneumonia, and the other 225 individuals had pulmonary imaging changes. A total of 143 individuals were eventually diagnosed as having asymptomatic infection through IgM antibody and IgG antibody detection. The sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rate of IgM and IgG antibody detection were approximately 97.1% (347 of 357), 95.3% (204 of 214), and 4.67% (10 of 214), respectively. It also indicated that during approximately 2 weeks, most individuals were both IgM positive and IgG positive, accounting for 68.57% (72 of 105). During approximately 3 weeks, the proportion of IgM-positive and IgG-positive individuals decreased to 8.57% (9 of 105), and the proportion of IgM-negative and IgG-positive individuals increased to 76.19% (80 of 105). Conclusions.—: There are highlighted prospects of IgM/IgG antibody detection as a preferred method in identifying the individuals with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially combined with nucleic acid tests and pulmonary CT scanning."
453,"Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections Among Persons Entering China From April 16 to October 12, 2020.",This population epidemiology study characterizes trends in the prevalence of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among international entrants testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at Chinese border checkpoints between mid-April and mid-October 2020.
454,"WHotLAMP: A simple, inexpensive, and sensitive molecular test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva.","Despite the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological control of the virus is still challenging due to slow vaccine rollouts, incomplete vaccine protection to current and emerging variants, and unwillingness to get vaccinated. Therefore, frequent testing of individuals to identify early SARS-CoV-2 infections, contact-tracing and isolation strategies remain crucial to mitigate viral spread. Here, we describe WHotLAMP, a rapid molecular test to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. WHotLAMP is simple to use, highly sensitive (~4 viral particles per microliter of saliva) and specific, as well as inexpensive, making it ideal for frequent screening. Moreover, WHotLAMP does not require toxic chemicals or specialized equipment and thus can be performed in point-of-care settings, and may also be adapted for resource-limited environments or home use. While applied here to SARS-CoV-2, WHotLAMP can be modified to detect other pathogens, making it adaptable for other diagnostic assays, including for use in future outbreaks."
455,A Multiplex One-Step RT-qPCR Protocol to Detect SARS-CoV-2 in NP/OP Swabs and Saliva.,"Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread extensively throughout the world, with more than 117 million reported cases and 2.6 million deaths (Johns Hopkins coronavirus resource center, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Detecting the virus is the first step in diagnosing the infection, followed by quarantine to prevent transmission. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs (NP/OP) and saliva are two specimen types that are most often analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by molecular tests that detect viral RNA or by antigen/antibody tests that detect viral proteins and/or the host immune response against the virus. Compared to antigen/antibody tests, molecular tests are highly sensitive and specific for detecting the virus. A significant drawback is that specimen collection requirements are specific to each test and cannot be interchanged with another test. Some tests are qualified to be used on NP swabs or saliva, but not both specimen types. Even with NP swabs, a test may be qualified to detect the virus only with swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM) but not in other media. These restrictive pre-analytic steps are disadvantageous in that a lab would have to develop and validate different tests for SARS-CoV-2 depending on the specimen type and collection media, with added setup cost, infrastructure, and training requirements. To overcome these problems, we developed and validated a cost-effective multiplex reverse-transcription real-time PCR assay that can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in different specimen types. The assay is highly sensitive and specific, can be used to detect the virus in saliva as well as NP swabs collected in different media such as VTM, saline, and commercial preservative fluid, and serves as one test for all applications. The protocol also describes an optimal laboratory setup and unidirectional workflow for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. © 2021 The Authors. Current Protocols published by Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic Protocol 1: Manual viral nucleic acid extraction from NP/OP swabs collected in different media, and from saliva Alternate Protocol 1: Low-throughput automated extraction on the Qiagen EZ1 Advanced XL machine (1-14 samples) Alternate Protocol 2: High-throughput automated extraction on the Kingfisher Flex machine (1-96 samples) Basic Protocol 2: Multiplex RT-qPCR protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 Alternate Protocol 3: Multiplex one-step RT-qPCR protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 with S and E gene probes labeled with the same fluorochrome."
456,"A non-enzymatic, isothermal strand displacement and amplification assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.","The current nucleic acid signal amplification methods for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection heavily rely on the functions of biological enzymes which imposes stringent transportation and storage conditions, high cost and global supply shortages. Here, a non-enzymatic whole genome detection method based on a simple isothermal signal amplification approach is developed for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and potentially any types of nucleic acids regardless of their size. The assay, termed non-enzymatic isothermal strand displacement and amplification (NISDA), is able to quantify 10 RNA copies.µL-1. In 164 clinical oropharyngeal RNA samples, NISDA assay is 100 % specific, and it is 96.77% and 100% sensitive when setting up in the laboratory and hospital, respectively. The NISDA assay does not require RNA reverse-transcription step and is fast (<30 min), affordable, highly robust at room temperature (>1 month), isothermal (42 °C) and user-friendly, making it an excellent assay for broad-based testing."
457,False-positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigen test in a man with acute HIV infection.,"Although rapid antigen tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is convenient, some articles have demonstrated their low sensitivity indicating false-negative results should always be considered. Here, we raise the issue of false-positive on rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 with the first case of acute HIV infection who repeatedly positive for the rapid antigen test. A 39-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of high-grade fever, dry cough, general fatigue, and anorexia. The rapid antigen test performed on a nasopharyngeal swab sample was positive, therefore the patient was separated in an isolated room apart from the COVID-19 ward while awaiting the confirmatory RT-PCR result. However, the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 performed on nasopharyngeal swabs was repeatedly negative (three times), while the antigen test was repeatedly positive (three times in total). This patient was eventually diagnosed with acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection based on a high titer of HIV-RNA and absence of plasma HIV-1/2 antibodies. Physicians should consider the possibility of false-positive results in addition to false-negative results when using a rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2, and keep in mind that nucleic acid amplification tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis."
458,Diagnostic Performance of Ag-RDTs and NAAT for SARS-CoV2 Identification in Symptomatic Patients in Catalonia.,"The use of rapid antigenic tests (Ag-RDTs) to diagnose a SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a common practice recently. This study aimed to evaluate performance of Abbott PanbioTM Ag-RDTs with regard to nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in the early stages of the disease. A cohort of 149,026 infected symptomatic patients, reported in Catalonia from November 2020 to January 2021, was selected. The positivity rates of the two tests were compared with respect to the dates of symptom onset. Ag-RDTs presented positivity rates of 84% in the transmission phases of the disease and 31% in the pre-symptomatic period, compared to 93% and 91%, respectively, for NAAT. The detection of many false negatives with Ag-RDTs during the pre-symptomatic period demonstrates the risk of virus dissemination with this diagnostic technique if used outside the symptomatic period."
459,Sample-to-Answer and Routine Real-Time RT-PCR: A Comparison of Different Platforms for SARS-CoV-2 Detection.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading all over the world and has caused millions of deaths. Several sample-to-answer platforms, including Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert Xpress), have received emergency use authorization for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection as a point of care test in the United States. However, their application niche is unclear when compared with real-time RT-PCR assays cleared by the National Medical Products Administration in China. In this study, the clinical performance, sensitivity, and workflow of Xpert Xpress and two real-time RT-PCR kits (BioGerm kit and Sansure kit) were evaluated by the specimens from 86 symptomatic patients. The positive percent agreement of Xpert Xpress was 100% compared with 96.15% for the BioGerm kit and 90% for the Sansure kit. The negative percent agreement was 100% for all three assays. The limit of detection is 100 copies/mL for Xpert Xpress and 500 copies/mL for the BioGerm kit and Sansure kit. By serially diluting five positive specimens, the Xpert Xpress had better detection capability. In the workflow and throughput analysis, the turnaround time was 51 minutes for Xpert Xpress, 150 minutes for the BioGerm kit, and 210 minutes for the Sansure kit. This study provides some indication for diagnosis methods selection."
