4240,COVID-19 in Patients with Cancer: A Retrospective Study of 212 Cases from a French SARS-CoV-2 Cluster During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"We describe a large series of patients with solid tumors in an early COVID-19 cluster in the eastern part of France. From February to May 2020, this multicenter retrospective study enrolled 212 patients with cancer under treatment or on follow-up for any type of malignant solid tumor and positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mortality rate was 30%. Patients with gastrointestinal cancers were identified as a subset of more vulnerable patients; immunotherapy and radiotherapy within 3 months from COVID-19 diagnosis were risk factors for death. The reported data support the essential need to be proactive and weigh the risks of morbidity from COVID-19 against the magnitude of benefits of intended cancer therapies during this pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article supports the essential need to be proactive (treatment delay or modification) in oncology in the setting of pandemic. This study identified patients with gastrointestinal cancers as a more vulnerable subset of patients with cancer and found that immunotherapy and radiotherapy within 3 months from COVID-19 diagnosis to be risk factors for death. The reported data indicate the necessity of weighing the risks of morbidity from COVID-19 against the magnitude of benefits of intended cancer therapies in any future wave of COVID-19."
4241,PPE training and the effectiveness of universal masking in preventing exposures: The importance of the relationship between anesthesia and infection prevention.,"Early in the pandemic, infection prevention (IP), in collaboration with our local anesthesia leadership, took the approach of ensuring all members of the Anesthesia Department understood the importance of universal masking, were individually trained on the use of the Controlled Air Purifier Respirator, as well the appropriate method for donning/doffing N95 respirators. Multiple providers in the department tested positive for COVID, resulting in the IP Department to conduct the routine contact tracing investigation. During the investigation, it was determined that all persons who met the CDC (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) contact exposure guidelines would undergo COVID testing, which consequently was 109 team members due to the exposure risk identified in the break room space. IP worked with the Anesthesia Preoperative Clinic to test all team members identified over a 3-day period (approximately 5-7 days postexposure). Out of the 109 team members who were tested postexposure, there were 0 conversions. The department attributes this to the consistency in personal protective equipment training, support and collaboration between anesthesia and IP which led to successful care for COVID patients with a limited provider infection rate."
4242,[Meta-analysis of diagnostic tests for the detection of COVID-19].,"Background: COVID-19 disease emerged at the end of 2019 and it started to be considered a pandemic at the beginning of 2020. The reference methodology for the COVID-19 diagnosis is the RT-qPCR. Objective: It was assessed the sensitivity and specificity of molecular test kits found on the list of tests of the Instituto de Diagnóstico y Referencia Epidemiológicos (InDRE, Institute for Epidemiologic Diagnosis and Reference). Material and methods: By using the PubMed and the Google Scholar platforms, a search was carried out for articles, out of which 14 were selected, retrieving the number of samples analyzed and their status (positive or negative), according to the molecular reference method, the name of the test kit used, as well as the characteristics and results obtained, expressed as true positives, false negatives, true negatives and false positives. Sensitivity and specificity of 8 kits were calculated, with compilations of the OpenEpi, version 3.01, statistical calculators, by using the Wilson score with a 95% confidence interval. Results: The sensitivity and specificity results for the kits were greater than 90%. Conclusions: Tests evaluated allow the detection of presence or absence of virus, but they can be affected by conditions during the stages of the method."

4245,Chemoprophylaxis trial designs in epidemics: insights from a systematic review of COVID-19 study registrations.,"Background: Chemoprophylactics against emerging epidemic and pandemic infectious diseases offer potential for prevention but require efficacy and safety analysis before widespread use can be recommended. Chemoprophylaxis with repurposed drugs enables deployment ahead of development of novel vaccines. It may have particular utility as a stopgap ahead of vaccine deployment or when vaccines become less effective on virus variants, in countries where there may be structural inaccessibility to vaccines or in specific risk-groups. Rapid implementation of robust trial designs is a persistent challenge in epidemics. We systematically reviewed SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 chemoprophylaxis trial registrations from the first 21 weeks of the pandemic to critically appraise significant design features and alignment of study populations to clinical and public health uses, and describe candidate chemoprophylactic agents. Methods: We searched online international trial databases from 31 Dec 2019 to 26 May 2020 using keywords ""proph*"" or ""prevention"". Trial protocols assessing efficacy of chemoprophylactic agents for COVID-19 were included. Trial components were screened for eligibility and relevant studies extracted. Key trial design features were assessed. Results: We found 76 chemoprophylaxis study registrations, proposing enrolment of 208,367 people with median size of 490 (IQR 262-1710). A randomised design was specified for 63 trials, 61 included a control group and total proposed enrolment size was 197,010, median 600 (IQR 236-1834). Four protocols provided information on effect size sought. We estimate that for a control group attack rate of 10%, 66% of trials would be underpowered to detect a 50% effect size, and 97% of trials would be underpowered to detect a 30% effect size (at the 80% level). We found evidence of adaptive design in one trial registration only. Laboratory-confirmed infection with or without symptoms was the most common primary outcome. Polymerase chain reaction testing alone was used in 46% of trials, serological testing in 6.6% and 14.5% used both testing methods. Healthcare workers were the target population in 52/79 (65.8%) trials: 49 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and 3 post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Sixteen trials (20.3%) planned PEP in close contacts. Five studies (6.3%) considered chemoprophylaxis in clinical-risk patients. Older adults were the focus of recruitment in only 3 (3.8%) studies (all long-term care facilities). Two (2.5%) studies of PrEP in the general population included older adults. Hydroxychloroquine was the most common candidate agent in 55/79 trials (69.6%), followed by chloroquine (4/79, 5.0%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (3/79, 3.8%). Conclusion: Many registered COVID-19 chemoprophylaxis efficacy trials were underpowered to detect clinically meaningful protection at epidemiologically informed attack rates. This, compounded with the time that has taken to organise these trials as compared to the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines, has rendered these trials of marginal importance. International coordination mechanisms and collaboration is required. Supporting the design of feasible chemoprophylaxis trials, large enough to generate strong evidence, early on in an epidemic using adaptive platform trial designs will allow structured entry and exit of candidate agents and rapid stand-up of trial infrastructure. Review protocol registration: Our protocol is registered at https://www.osf.io/vp56f on May 20, 2020."
4246,Critical Aspects Concerning the Development of a Pooling Approach for SARS-CoV-2 Diagnosis Using Large-Scale PCR Testing.,"The primary approach to controlling the spread of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 is to diagnose and isolate the infected people quickly. Our paper aimed to investigate the efficiency and the reliability of a hierarchical pooling approach for large-scale PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. To identify the best conditions for the pooling approach for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-qPCR, we investigated four manual methods for both RNA extraction and PCR assessment targeting one or more of the RdRp, N, S, and ORF1a genes, by using two PCR devices and an automated flux for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We determined the most efficient and accurate diagnostic assay, taking into account multiple parameters. The optimal pool size calculation included the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the assay sensitivity of 95%, an assay specificity of 100%, and a range of pool sizes of 5 to 15 samples. Our investigation revealed that the most efficient and accurate procedure for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 has a detection limit of 2.5 copies/PCR reaction. This pooling approach proved to be efficient and accurate in detecting SARS-CoV-2 for all samples with individual quantification cycle (Cq) values lower than 35, accounting for more than 94% of all positive specimens. Our data could serve as a comprehensive practical guide for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic centers planning to address such a pooling strategy."

4248,Biomaterials and Oxygen Join Forces to Shape the Immune Response and Boost COVID-19 Vaccines.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented global health crisis, resulting in a critical need for effective vaccines that generate protective antibodies. Protein subunit vaccines represent a promising approach but often lack the immunogenicity required for strong immune stimulation. To overcome this challenge, it is first demonstrated that advanced biomaterials can be leveraged to boost the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 protein subunit vaccines. Additionally, it is reported that oxygen is a powerful immunological co-adjuvant and has an ability to further potentiate vaccine potency. In preclinical studies, mice immunized with an oxygen-generating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cryogel-based vaccine (O2-CryogelVAX) exhibit a robust Th1 and Th2 immune response, leading to a sustained production of highly effective neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Even with a single immunization, O2-CryogelVAX achieves high antibody titers within 21 days, and both binding and neutralizing antibody levels are further increased after a second dose. Engineering a potent vaccine system that generates sufficient neutralizing antibodies after one dose is a preferred strategy amid vaccine shortage. The data suggest that this platform is a promising technology to reinforce vaccine-driven immunostimulation and is applicable to current and emerging infectious diseases."
4249,A database resource and online analysis tools for coronaviruses on a historical and global scale.,"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a new zoonotic origin coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) has sound the alarm for the potential spread of epidemic coronavirus crossing species. With the urgent needs to assist disease control and to provide invaluable scientific information, we developed the coronavirus database (CoVdb), an online genomic, proteomic and evolutionary analysis platform. CoVdb has brought together genomes of more than 5000 coronavirus strains, which were collected from 1941 to 2020, in more than 60 countries and in hosts belonging to more than 30 species, ranging from fish to human. CoVdb presents comprehensive genomic information, such as gene function, subcellular localization, topology and protein structure. To facilitate coronavirus research, CoVdb also provides flexible search approaches and online tools to view and analyze protein structure, to perform multiple alignments, to automatically build phylogenetic trees and to carry on evolutionary analyses. CoVdb can be accessed freely at http://covdb.popgenetics.net. Hopefully, it will accelerate the progress to develop medicines or vaccines to control the pandemic of COVID-19."
