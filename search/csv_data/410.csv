4091,"Orthognathic surgery in COVID-19 times, is it safe?","COVID-19 has impacted the provision of orthognathic surgery globally. Uncertainty around its effects and transmission in aerosol generating procedures (AGP's) has led to disagreement within maxillofacial surgeons into the safety of orthognathic surgery during the pandemic. We present a local case series of orthognathic surgery undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge no such similar study has been reported worldwide. Data was collected from the 1st June to 30th November 2020 for all patients undergoing orthognathic surgery by a single consultant. All procedures and inpatient stays were performed 'off site' at the local Spire Healthcare Group plcÂ© facility. A strict preoperative two-week self-isolation period and negative COVID-19 testing was mandatory. All procedures were classified as AGP's and personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn in line with local guidelines. The primary outcome was 30-day COVID-19 infection among patients, with day 0 the date of surgery. Secondary outcome measures included duration of stay, return to theatre and complications. A total of 59 patients were identified. 42/59 had bimaxillary procedures and 17/59 single jaw. 9/17 had maxillary and 8/17 had mandibular procedures. A total of 3/59 had simultaneous genioplasty. Median duration of stay was one night (range 1-3). Immediate and late complications were seen in 3% (2/59) and 3% (2/59) respectively. Only 1% (1/59) returned to theatre. Zero patients tested positive in the 30-day postoperative period. No staff members tested positive for the duration of the study. Adopting strict safety protocols, orthognathic surgery can be safely delivered during the pandemic without detriment to the patient or staff."

4093,Comparison of Commercially Available and Laboratory-Developed Assays for In Vitro Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Clinical Laboratories.,"Multiple laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) and commercially available assays have emerged to meet diagnostic needs related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. To date, there is limited comparison data for these different testing platforms. We compared the analytical performance of a LDT developed in our clinical laboratory based on CDC primer sets and four commercially available, FDA emergency use authorized assays for SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, DiaSorin, Hologic Panther, and Roche Cobas) on a total of 169 nasopharyngeal swabs. The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-CoV-2 with 100% agreement across specimens. The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa, and Roche Cobas 6800 failed to detect positive specimens only near the limit of detection of our CDC-based LDT assay. All assays were 100% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold standard. Our results provide initial test performance characteristics for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and highlight the importance of having multiple viral detection testing platforms available in a public health emergency."

4095,Schrodinger's Worker: Are They Positive or Negative for SARS-CoV-2?,"In these days of 2020, tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, and their use in the context of health surveillance of workers, are becoming popular. Nevertheless, their sensitivity and specificity could vary on the basis of the type of test used and on the moment of infection of the subject tested. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to make employers, workers, occupational physicians, and public health specialists think about the limits of diagnostic tests currently available, and the possible implication related to the erroneous and incautious assignment of ""immunity passports"" or ""risk-free certificates"" to workers during screening campaigns in workplaces."
4096,Accurate point-of-care serology tests for COVID-19.,"Background: As COVID-19 vaccines become available, screening individuals for prior COVID-19 infection and vaccine response in point-of-care (POC) settings has renewed interest. We prospectively screened at-risk individuals for SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein antibodies in a POC setting to determine if it was a feasible method to identify antibody from prior infection. Methods: Three EUA-approved lateral flow antibody assays were performed on POC finger-stick blood and compared with serum and a CLIA nucleocapsid antibody immunoassay. Variables including antibody class, time since PCR, and the assay antigen used were evaluated. Results: 512 subjects enrolled, of which 104 had a COVID-19 history and positive PCR. Only three PCR-positive subjects required hospitalization, with one requiring mechanical ventilation. The POC results correlated well with the immunoassay (93-97% sensitivity) and using serum did not improve the sensitivity or specificity. Conclusions: Finger-stick, POC COVID-19 antibody testing was highly effective in identifying antibody resulting from prior infections in mildly symptomatic subjects. Using high-complexity serum immunoassays did not improve the screening outcome. Almost all individuals with COVID-19 infection produced detectable antibodies to the virus. POC antibody testing is useful as a screen for prior COVID-19 infection, and should be useful in assessing vaccine response."
4097,Aftermath of fortnightly universal testing for severe acute respiratory corona virus-2 infection in maintenance hemodialysis patients.,"Introduction: Asymptomatic maintenance hemodialysis patients with acute respiratory corona virus-2 (SARS-COV-2) are missed with pre-dialysis screening without testing. The possible ideal strategy of testing each patient before each shift with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is not feasible. We aimed to study the effectiveness of fortnightly screening with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in curbing transmission. Methods: Between July 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, all 273 patients receiving hemodialysis were subjected to fortnightly testing for SARS-Cov-2 in the unit to detect asymptomatic patients. The cost and effectiveness of universal testing in preventing transmission were analyzed using susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) modeling assuming R0 of 2.2. Results: Of 273 MHD patients, 55 (20.1%) found infected with SARS-CoV-2 over 3 months. Six (10.9%) were symptomatic, and 49 (89.1%) asymptomatic at the time of testing. Six (10.9%) asymptomatic patients develop symptoms later, and 43 (78.2%) remained asymptomatic. A total of seven (6.1%) HCWs also tested positive for the virus. Fortnightly universal testing is cost-effective, and SIR modeling proved effective in preventing person-to-person transmission. Conclusions: Repeated universal testing in maintenance hemodialysis patients detected 89% of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients over 3 months and appeared to be an effective strategy to prevent person-to-person transmission in the dialysis unit."
