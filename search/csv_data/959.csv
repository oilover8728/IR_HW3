9580,The advantages of drug treatment with statins in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a status of global pandemic caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19). The pandemic is currently underway, and to date has caused approximately 2.42 million deaths worldwide. The first vaccines have recently been licensed; however, research continues to identify therapeutic agents to prevent serious complications, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticoagulant or antiviral agents authorized for other therapeutic indications. Epidemiological evidence shows that advanced age and comorbidities, such as diabetes, heart disease, and dyslipidemia may represent COVID-19 risk factors. In particular, in patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with statins, it is recommended that treatment should not be discontinued if COVID-19 infection occurs. The pleiotropic effects of statins are well known. In this brief review, we propose that the use of statins can potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2-induced tissue damage and improve lung function in COVID-19 patients through several pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects of statins that may be a significant benefit in patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with statins and COVID-19 positive. Recent evidence shows promising results."

9582,Atomic force microscopy analysis of native infectious and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions.,"SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, single viruses were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) operating directly in a level 3 biosafety (BSL3) facility, which appeared as a fast and powerful method to assess at the nanoscale level and in 3D infectious virus morphology in its native conformation, or upon inactivation treatments. AFM imaging reveals structurally intact infectious and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 upon low concentration of formaldehyde treatment. This protocol combining AFM and plaque assays allows the preparation of intact inactivated SARS-CoV-2 particles for safe use of samples out of level 3 laboratory to accelerate researches against the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we illustrate how adapted BSL3-AFM is a remarkable toolbox for rapid and direct virus analysis based on nanoscale morphology."
9583,"Characterization of a Lineage C.36 SARS-CoV-2 Isolate with Reduced Susceptibility to Neutralization Circulating in Lombardy, Italy.","SARS-CoV-2 spike is evolving to maximize transmissibility and evade the humoral response. The massive genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates has led to the identification of single-point mutations and deletions, often having the recurrence of hotspots, associated with advantageous phenotypes. We report the isolation and molecular characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 strain, belonging to a lineage (C.36) not previously associated with concerning traits, which shows decreased susceptibility to vaccine sera neutralization."
9584,Dentistry and the Pandemic: A Year of Reckoning.,"In March 2020, the world that we know irrevocably changed forever. It feels like ""Groundhog Day"" all over again, and it seems that the nightmare is here to stay. It all began on the January 8, 2020, when China grimly announced that coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2)1 but it was not until March 2020 that the situation swiftly careened out of control and is unequivocally posing the greatest challenge to humanity worldwide since the end of the Second World War. While the scientific community heroically galvanized itself and raced against time to provide viable solutions to this formidable foe in the form of vaccines, the worldwide dental fraternity has had to grapple with an extraordinary situation evolving in real-time and ensure that we responded robustly to this daunting health emergency that has spared no corner of our beloved planet. Initially, COVID-19 ensured cessation of all non-urgent dental care in most parts of the world but with increasingly significant inputs about the nature of the pathogen from the scientific community, the dental community has been able to cobble together a workable plan in reconfiguring and restructuring the dental practice in consonance with the situation at hand. It is fiendishly arduous to estimate the massive impact on the dental profession, but it is safe to assume it to be substantial."
9585,Initial Results of the Use of a Standardized Diagnostic Criteria for Chest Computed Tomography Findings in Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the initial results of chest computed tomography (CT) standardized diagnostic criteria proposed by the Radiological Society of North America in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods: Seventy-one patients who underwent RT-PCR test for COVID-19 and chest CT within an interval of 4 days or less were included. Seventy-five CTs were reviewed and classified as typical, indeterminate, or atypical appearance or negative for pneumonia by 2 radiologists. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of the CT diagnostic criteria in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Results: The prevalence of positive RT-PCR was 45.1%. It was obtained a sensitivity of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78%-89%), a specificity of 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%), an accuracy of 91% (95% CI, 85%-96%), a positive predictive value of 97% (95% CI, 91%-99%), and a negative predictive value of 86% (95% CI, 80%-92%). The diagnostic performance was excellent, considering the area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.84-0.99). Conclusions: Chest CT standardized diagnostic criteria had high specificity and positive predictive value for the diagnosis of COVID-19 when presenting a typical appearance."
9586,Native Structure-Based Peptides as Potential Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and Human ACE2 Receptor.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-strand RNA virus that causes severe respiratory syndrome in humans, which is now referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since December 2019, the new pathogen has rapidly spread globally, with over 65 million cases reported to the beginning of December 2020, including over 1.5 million deaths. Unfortunately, currently, there is no specific and effective treatment for COVID-19. As SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike proteins (S) to bind to a host cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2(ACE2), and this interaction is proved to be responsible for entering a virus into host cells, it makes an ideal target for antiviral drug development. In this work, we design three very short peptides based on the ACE2 sequence/structure fragments, which may effectively bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein and may, in turn, disrupt the important virus-host protein-protein interactions, blocking early steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two of our peptides bind to virus protein with affinity in nanomolar range, and as very short peptides have great potential for drug development."
9587,Innate immune evasion mediated by picornaviral 3C protease: Possible lessons for coronaviral 3C-like protease?,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is the etiological agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019, a multi-organ disease that has triggered an unprecedented global health and economic crisis. The virally encoded 3C-like protease (3CLpro ), which is named after picornaviral 3C protease (3Cpro ) due to their similarities in substrate recognition and enzymatic activity, is essential for viral replication and has been considered as the primary drug target. However, information regarding the cellular substrates of 3CLpro and its interaction with the host remains scarce, though recent work has begun to shape our understanding more clearly. Here we summarized and compared the mechanisms by which picornaviruses and coronaviruses have evolved to evade innate immune surveillance, with a focus on the established role of 3Cpro in this process. Through this comparison, we hope to highlight the potential action and mechanisms that are conserved and shared between 3Cpro and 3CLpro . In this review, we also briefly discussed current advances in the development of broad-spectrum antivirals targeting both 3Cpro and 3CLpro ."
9588,"COVID 19 in Children: Gastrointestinal, Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Manifestation.","The most devastating pandemic of this era coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although it is primarily a respiratory pathogen, it can also result in several extra-pulmonary manifestations includes gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatocellular injury. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), the entry receptor for the causative coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is co-express in the gastrointestinal tract, hepatocyte, and cholangiocytes similar to the respiratory mucosa. The presence of these receptors facilitates the entry into the tissue and causes direct viral tissue damage, which is a proposed mechanism of injury. Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort are common gastrointestinal manifestations, whereas derangement of liver function tests is the most hepatic manifestation in COVID-19. In this article, we reviewed on SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19 regarding gastrointestinal, hepatic, and pancreatic manifestation, the mechanisms by which the virus may inflict damage, and their management perspective."
9589,"Persistence of SARS-CoV-2-Specific IgG in Children 6 Months After Infection, Australia.",The duration of the humoral immune response in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is unknown. We detected specific IgG 6 months after infection in children who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms of coronavirus disease. These findings will inform vaccination strategies and other prevention measures.
