7850,Validation of dried blood spot sample modifications to two commercially available COVID-19 IgG antibody immunoassays.,"Aim: Coronavirus disease 2019 antibody testing often relies on venous blood collection, which is labor-intensive, inconvenient and expensive compared with finger-stick capillary dried blood spot (DBS) collection. The purpose of our work was to determine if two commercially available anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IgG antibodies against spike S1 subunit and nucleocapsid proteins could be validated for use with DBS. Materials & methods: Kit supplied reagents were used to extract DBS, and in-house DBS calibrators were included on every run. Results: Positive/negative concordance between DBS and serum was 100/99.3% for the spike S1 subunit assay and 100/98% for the nucleocapsid assay. Conclusion: Validation of the DBS Coronavirus disease 2019 IgG antibody assays demonstrated that serum and DBS can produce equivalent results with minimal kit modifications."
7851,Histopathological features of SARS-CoV-2 infection and relationships with organoid technology.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) following infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic that is still having serious effects worldwide. This virus, which targets the lungs in particular, can also damage other tissues. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) plays a key role in viral entry into host cells. The presence of ACE-2 in various tissues may permit viral infection. Studies of COVID-19 often make use of postmortem tissues. Although this information provides various useful results, it is also necessary to conduct in vitro studies to understand optimal treatment approaches. Because the virus may show species-specific differences, in vitro technologies using human cells are particularly important. Organoid technologies, three-dimensional structures that can be obtained from human cells, are playing increasingly important roles in studies of SARS-CoV-2. This technology offers a significant advantage in terms of mimicking in vivo tissue structures and testing antiviral compounds. In this mini-review, we summarize studies of SARS-CoV-2 using both histopathological and organoid technology approaches."
7852,Consensus statement on coronary intervention during the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic: from the Korean Society of Interventional Cardiology.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The first case developed in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China; several months later, COVID-19 has become pandemic, and there is no end in sight. This disaster is also causing serious health problems in the area of cardiovascular intervention. In response, the Korean Society of Interventional Cardiology formed a COVID-19 task force to develop practice guidelines. This special article introduces clinical practice guidelines to prevent secondary transmission of COVID-19 within facilities; the guidelines were developed to protect patients and healthcare workers from this highly contagious virus. We hope these guidelines help healthcare workers and cardiovascular disease patients around the world cope with the COVID-19 pandemic."
7853,SARS-CoV-2 entry into human airway organoids is serine protease-mediated and facilitated by the multibasic cleavage site.,"Coronavirus entry is mediated by the spike protein that binds the receptor and mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. The proteases that mediate entry differ between cell lines, and it is currently unclear which proteases are relevant in vivo. A remarkable feature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS), which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike MBCS increases infectivity on human airway organoids (hAOs). Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into Calu-3 cells and, more frequently, formed syncytia in hAOs. Moreover, the MBCS increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to cathepsin-mediated endosomal entry. Blocking serine proteases, but not cathepsins, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in hAOs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells using serine proteases, and suggest that the MBCS is an adaptation to this viral entry strategy."

7855,Learning from the past: development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.,"The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has elicited an equally rapid response aiming to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. These efforts are encouraging; however, comprehensive efficacy and safety evaluations are essential in the development of a vaccine, and we can learn from previous vaccine development campaigns. In this Perspective, we summarize examples of vaccine-associated disease enhancement in the history of developing vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus, dengue virus, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which highlight the importance of a robust safety and efficacy profile, and present recommendations for preclinical and clinical evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine candidates as well as for vaccine design and optimization."

7857,Economic and Behavioral Influencers of Vaccination and Antimicrobial Use.,"Despite vast improvements in global vaccination coverage during the last decade, there is a growing trend in vaccine hesitancy and/or refusal globally. This has implications for the acceptance and coverage of a potential vaccine against COVID-19. In the United States, the number of children exempt from vaccination for ""philosophical belief-based"" non-medical reasons increased in 12 of the 18 states that allowed this policy from 2009 to 2017 (1). Meanwhile, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, especially in young children, have led to increasing rates of drug resistance that threaten our ability to treat infectious diseases. Vaccine hesitancy and antibiotic overuse exist side-by-side in the same population of young children, and it is unclear why one modality (antibiotics) is universally seen as safe and effective, while the other (vaccines) is seen as potentially hazardous by some. In this review, we consider the drivers shaping the use of vaccines and antibiotics in the context of three factors: individual incentives, risk perceptions, and social norms and group dynamics. We illustrate how these factors contribute to the societal and individual costs of vaccine underuse and antimicrobial overuse. Ultimately, we seek to understand these factors that are at the nexus of infectious disease epidemiology and social science to inform policy-making."
7858,"Racism, disease, and vaccine refusal: People of color are dying for access to COVID-19 vaccines.","As the vaccines against COVID are slowly becoming available, we need to consider the paradox of why so many people of color are dying from the disease yet cannot get the vaccinations. Concerns focus on vaccine refusal but lack of access is the bigger problem."
7859,Diagnostic accuracy of two commercial SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid tests at the point of care in community-based testing centers.,"Objectives: Determine the diagnostic accuracy of two antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care and define individuals' characteristics providing best performance. Methods: We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of two Ag-RDT in comparison to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: Between October 9th and 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The PanbioTM Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI: 78.0-91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1-100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI: 83.7-93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4-100). For individuals presenting with fever 1-5 days post symptom onset, combined Ag-RDT sensitivity was above 95%. Lower sensitivity of 88.2% was seen on the same day of symptom development (day 0). Conclusions: We provide an independent validation of two widely available commercial Ag-RDTs, both meeting WHO criteria of ≥80% sensitivity and ≥97% specificity. Although less sensitive than RT-PCR, these assays could be beneficial due to their rapid results, ease of use, and independence from existing laboratory structures. Testing criteria focusing on patients with typical symptoms in their early symptomatic period onset could further increase diagnostic value."
