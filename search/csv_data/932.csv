9310,SARS-CoV-2-Induced Vomiting as Onset Symptom in a Patient with COVID-19.,
9311,Positive control synthesis method for COVID-19 diagnosis by one-step real-time RT-PCR.,"Backgrounds: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still ongoing. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) is regarded as a gold-standard method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, unexpected contamination of synthesized positive control samples included in COVID-19 test kits have increased the inconclusiveness of disease interpretation. Therefore, it is important to establish new methods for the preparation of reliable positive controls that are not affected by contamination for the accurate for diagnosis of COVID-19, but it still remains a challenge. Methods: A new approach for producing synthetic positive controls using synthetic positive template (SPT) oligonucleotides was designed. SPT oligonucleotides contain probe binding and virus-irrelevant regions were used as templates for real-time PCR to evaluate the expression level of SARS-CoV-2 genes (RdRP, E, and N). The limit of detection (LOD) for individual SARS-CoV-2 genes by Ct values with different concentrations of SPT templates and genomic RNAs from SARS-CoV-2 infected samples was determined. Results: LODs with SPT templates were >10-15 (atto) M for RdRP, 10-12 (femto) to 10-13 (100 atto) M for E gene, and 10-12 to 10-14 (10 atto) M for N gene, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR assay using serially diluted genomic RNAs prepared from SARS-CoV-2 virus infected cultures showed that picogram quantities of RNAs is resulted in the LOD. The sensitivity of RdRP and E genes based on Ct values was less than that of N gene with this platform. Conclusion: This method significantly reduces the risk of false-positive reactions resulting from contamination in the synthesis procedures of positive control materials. Therefore, this approach could be integrated into the currrently available COVID-19 test kits and will provide a general method for preparing positive controls in the diagnosis of emerging RNA virus infections."
9312,"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Associated Belgian Governmental Measures on Cancer Screening, Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology.","Introduction: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Unprecedented public health actions were introduced, including social distancing, travel restrictions and quarantine. The Belgian government announced a national emergency plan, thereby postponing all non-urgent medical consultations and operations. This report analyses the impact of these measures on cancer screening, through assessment of the workload of a laboratory for histopathology and cytopathology. Methods: Data on monthly numbers of histological and cytological samples, immunohistochemistry and molecular tests were extracted from the laboratory information management system. Results: The global histopathological and cytological workload was substantially reduced. The impact on oncology-related surgical procedures was rather limited. The anti-COVID-19 measures significantly diminished all screening-related samples, such as colon biopsies, breast biopsies and cervical cytology, and strongly reduced the number of samples related to ""functional"" pathology, such as thyroidectomies and gastric biopsies. Conclusions: Since many health care interventions are reflected in the workload of a pathology laboratory, this study enabled us to identify areas for ""deconfinement"" health care actions. Our findings indicate that various areas in medicine were affected, but the impact seemed largest for cancer screening. Health care professionals should assure that consultations related to cancer screening are postponed instead of cancelled."
9313,"Concomitant Marked Decline in Prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Other Respiratory Viruses Among Symptomatic Patients Following Public Health Interventions in Australia: Data from St Vincent's Hospital and Associated Screening Clinics, Sydney, NSW.","Our Australian hospital tested almost 22 000 symptomatic people over 11 weeks for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Following travel bans and physical distancing, SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses diagnoses fell dramatically. Increasing rhinovirus diagnoses as social control measures were relaxed may indirectly indicate an elevated risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resurgence."
9314,Top Concerns of Tweeters During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infoveillance Study.,"Background: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. Objective: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (""corona,"" ""2019-nCov,"" and ""COVID-19""), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. Results: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). Conclusions: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news."
9315,Respiratory viruses in foods and their potential transmission through the diet: A review of the literature.,"Respiratory viruses are the main agents causing respiratory tract diseases. Nowadays, coronaviruses - and specifically, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 - are the principal responsible for the major epidemic outbreaks of the 21st century. The major routes of transmission for respiratory viruses - including coronaviruses - are via direct and indirect contacts. However, transmission through contaminated foods has not been extensively assessed. The present paper was aimed at reviewing scientific data on the transmission of respiratory viruses through potentially contaminated foods. While the current data seem to suggest that this route of transmission is not likely to occur, in order to increase the knowledge on this issue further investigations are still clearly necessary for a more complete prevention of the risks. Studies should include fresh produce and cooked foods. Anyway, prevention measures and good hygienic practices for both consumers and workers are mandatory when handling and cooking foods."
9316,"Comparative transcriptome analysis of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 to identify potential pathways for drug repurposing.","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has already caused in excess of 1.25 million deaths worldwide, and the number is increasing. Knowledge of the host transcriptional response against this virus and how the pathways are activated or suppressed compared to other human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) that caused outbreaks previously can help in the identification of potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, we used time point meta-analysis to investigate available SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in-vitro transcriptome datasets in order to identify the significant genes and pathways that are dysregulated at each time point. The subsequent over-representation analysis (ORA) revealed that several pathways are significantly dysregulated at each time point after both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. We also performed gene set enrichment analyses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with that of SARS-CoV-2 at the same time point and cell line, the results of which revealed that common pathways are activated and suppressed in all three coronaviruses. Furthermore, an analysis of an in-vivo transcriptomic dataset of COVID-19 patients showed that similar pathways are enriched to those identified in the earlier analyses. Based on these findings, a drug repurposing analysis was performed to identify potential drug candidates for combating COVID-19."
9317,A mini-review on the effects of COVID-19 on younger individuals.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has uprooted our lives like never before since its onset in the late December 2019. The world has seen mounting infections and deaths over the past few months despite the unprecedented measures countries are implementing, such as lockdowns, social distancing, mask-wearing, and banning gatherings in large groups. Interestingly, young individuals seem less likely to be impacted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. While the rate of transmission, symptom presentation, and fatality is lower in children than people from other age groups, they have been disproportionately affected by strict lockdown measures needed to curb viral spread. In this review, we describe the association between patient age and COVID-19, epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, psychological effects associated with lockdowns and school closures, and possible mechanisms underlying lower transmission rate of COVID-19 in children."
9318,Combined recombinase polymerase amplification/rkDNA-graphene oxide probing system for detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"The development of rapid, highly sensitive, and selective methods for the diagnosis of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) should help to prevent the spread of this pandemic virus. In this study, we combined recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), as a means of isothermal DNA amplification, with an rkDNA-graphene oxide (GO) probe system to allow the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and selectivity. We used in situ enzymatic synthesis to prepare an rkDNA probe that was complementary to an RPA-amplified sequence of the target N-gene of SARS-CoV-2. The fluorescence of this rkDNA was perfectly quenched in the presence of GO. When the quenched rkDNA-GO system was added to the RPA-amplified sequence of the target SARS-CoV-2, the fluorescence recovered dramatically. The combined RPA/rkDNA-GO system exhibited extremely high selectivity (discrimination factor: 17.2) and sensitivity (LOD = 6.0 aM) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The total processing time was only 1.6 h. This combined RPA/rkDNA-GO system appears to be a very efficient and simple method for the point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2."
9319,SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell memory is sustained in COVID-19 convalescent patients for 10 months with successful development of stem cell-like memory T cells.,"Memory T cells contribute to rapid viral clearance during re-infection, but the longevity and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells remain unclear. Here we conduct ex vivo assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in COVID-19 convalescent patients up to 317 days post-symptom onset (DPSO), and find that memory T cell responses are maintained during the study period regardless of the severity of COVID-19. In particular, we observe sustained polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells detected by activation-induced markers, the proportion of stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells is increased, peaking at approximately 120 DPSO. Development of TSCM cells is confirmed by SARS-CoV-2-specific MHC-I multimer staining. Considering the self-renewal capacity and multipotency of TSCM cells, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are long-lasting after recovery from COVID-19, thus support the feasibility of effective vaccination programs as a measure for COVID-19 control."
