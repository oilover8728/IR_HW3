9920,Iran's Approach to COVID-19: Evolving Treatment Protocols and Ongoing Clinical Trials.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging the health care systems around the world and compelling them to timely share their strategies, tactics and experiences. Since mid-January, a huge volume of instructions has been released by Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) covering diverse aspects of disease control and prevention. In this study, we aimed to review the instructions published either before or after COVID-19's transmission to Iran to depict the clinical approach and therapeutics used in Iran to battle the current pandemic. We retrospectively gathered and critically reviewed all official situation reports, guidelines, guidance, flowcharts, protocols, recommendations and advice released by Iranian scientific, or administrative arms of action against COVID-19. The ongoing clinical trials approved by MOHME and registered to the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) have been reviewed as well. Our study resulted in the following mainstays of Iran's approach to COVID-19: (i) active clinical screening; preferably on-line or on-phone, (ii) management of limited paraclinical resources; by using them as diagnostic tools rather than epidemiological, (iii) a trend toward outpatient care of mild-to-moderate cases; either confirmed or suspicious, with active scheduled follow-up, and (iv) avoidance of pharmacotherapy, as far as possible. The therapeutic and administrative instructions are still being actively updated with some recommendations different from the previous ones. Nevertheless, a common approach in the background could be detected, It seems that the instructions are conceptually in line with the first ""National Guideline for 2019-nCoV"" published on 20 January 2020. The screening has mainly been clinically oriented rather than being based on laboratory tests and MOHME seems to be following the approach of ""early detection of symptomatic cases followed by early source control."""
9921,The Second Wave of SARS-CoV-2 Circulation-Antibody Detection in the Domestic Cat Population in Germany.,"Registered cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in the German human population increased rapidly during the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in winter 2020/21. Since domestic cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, the occurrence of trans-species transmission needs to be monitored. A previous serosurvey during the first wave of the pandemic detected antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 0.65% of feline serum samples that were randomly sampled across Germany. In the here-presented follow-up study that was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, the seroprevalence rose to 1.36% (16/1173). This doubling of the seroprevalence in cats is in line with the rise of reported cases in the human population and indicates a continuous occurrence of trans-species transmission from infected owners to their cats."
9922,Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic in Brazil: The Hidden Mortality.,"The world changed in just a few months after the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a beta coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Brazil currently has the world's second-highest COVID-19 death toll, second only to the USA. The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading fast in the world with more than 181 countries affected. This editorial refers to the article published in Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia: ""Increase in home deaths due to cardiorespiratory arrest in times of COVID-19 pandemic.""1 Their main results show a gradual increase in the rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Their data demonstrate a proportional increase of 33% of home deaths in March 2020 compared to previous periods. Their study is the first Brazilian paper to demonstrate the same trend observed in other countries."

9924,"COVID-19 in cancer patients: risk, clinical features, and management.","A novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread across the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern. Cancer patients are regarded as a highly vulnerable population to SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of more severe COVID-19 symptoms, which is possibly due to the systemic immunosuppressive state caused directly by tumor growth and indirectly by effects of anticancer treatment. Currently, much effort has been directed toward studying the pathogenesis and treatment of COVID-19, but the risk profiles, prognoses, and treatment outcomes in cancer patients remain unclear. Based on the current literature, we summarize the risk profiles, clinical and biochemical characteristics, and therapy outcomes of COVID-19 infections in cancer patients. The challenges in the clinical care of cancer patients with COVID-19 are discussed. The goal of this review is to stimulate research to better understand the biological impact and prognoses of COVID-19 infections in cancer patients, thus facilitating improvement of the clinical management of these patients."
9925,COVID-19 Infection: Data Gaps for Diagnostic Laboratory Preparedness and Tasks on Hand.,"Emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) and its spread, with life-threatening outcomes, have caused a pandemic burden worldwide. Studies of emerging diseases under outbreak conditions have focused on the complete spectrum of pathogens, transmissibility, shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity, epidemiological causes, and interventions to control emergence. During the initial stages of an outbreak, laboratory response capacity focuses on expansion of efficient diagnostic tools for rapid case detection, contact tracing, putting epidemiological findings into sources, mode of transmission, and identification of susceptible groups and reservoirs. It is important for public health diagnostic laboratories to have a fundamental knowledge of viral shedding, antibody response kinetics, assay validation, interpretation, and uncertainties of test results. This study reviewed currently published data from available literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared this with data on viral shedding and antibody response kinetics of other human coronaviruses. Also described are current challenges and comments on some biases and significant data gaps that have limited laboratory preparedness to SARS-CoV-2. Consistent documentation of progress and data gaps from standardized reporting of methods utilized, sampling date, details of test results by specimen type, risk assessments, and symptoms can all be used strategically and provide incentives to governments and their partners to prioritize the development, detection, and response to outbreaks."
9926,Paediatric gastrointestinal disorders in SARS-CoV-2 infection: Epidemiological and clinical implications.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a threat worldwide for individuals of all ages, including children. Gastrointestinal manifestations could be the initial presenting manifestation in many patients, especially in children. These symptoms are more common in patients with severe disease than in patients with non-severe disease. Approximately 48.1% of patients had a stool sample that was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA. Children typically form 1%-8% of all laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2. Gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 in children are not rare, with a prevalence between 0 and 88%, and a wide variety of presentations, including diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, can develop before, with or after the development of respiratory symptoms. Atypical manifestations such as appendicitis or liver injury could also appear, especially in the presence of multisystem inflammatory disease. In this review, we discussed the epidemiology of COVID-19 gastrointestinal diseases in children as well as their implications on the diagnosis, misdiagnosis, prognosis, and faecal-oral transmission route of COVID-19 and the impact of gastrointestinal diseases on the gut microbiome, child nutrition, and disease management."
9927,Molecular Insights into the Crosstalk Between Immune Inflammation Nexus and SARS-CoV-2 Virus.,"COVID-19, a type of viral pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has challenged the world as global pandemic. It has marked the identification of third generation of extremely pathogenic zoonotic coronaviruses of twenty-first century posing threat to humans and mainly targeting the lower respiratory tract. In this review, we focused on not only the structure and virology of SARS-COV-2 but have discussed in detail the molecular immunopathogenesis of this novel virus highlighting its interaction with immune system and the role of compromised or dysregulated immune response towards disease severity. We attempted to correlate the crosstalk between unregulated inflammatory outcomes with disrupted host immunity which may play a potential role towards fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome that claims to be life-threatening in COVID-19. Exploration and investigation of molecular host-virus interactions will provide a better understanding on the mechanism of fatal COVID-19 infection and also enlighten the escape routes from the same."
9928,[Update 2021: COVID-19 from the Perspective of Haematology and Haemostaseology].,Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has a profound influence on the hematopoetic system that mediates clinical symptoms and mortality. Several studies have shown that treatment of the cytokine storm (CRS) with anti-inflammatory drugs like dexamethasone and tocilizumab can significantly improve survival. Systematic reviews confirm the safety of convalescent plasma administration and offer initial indications of its effectiveness in certain groups. COVID-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) represent severe infection- or vaccination associated complications that require a specific diagnostic and therapeutic workup.
9929,Treatment of Patients with Mental Illness Amid A Global COVID-19 Pandemic.,"A newly discovered coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is not only physically challenging but also has many subtle and overt mental impacts. The concern of being infected, lack of antiviral agents, preventive strategies of social distancing, and home isolation have created unrest in the society. The way of reacting to emergencies varies from individual to individual, and that this variability lies in our unique personality traits. The COVID-19 pandemic is testing the mental stability of all of us, and hence it is crucial to recognize the vulnerable population and support them to prevent or minimize the catastrophe like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emotional trauma, and suicides. In this context, the role of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and other mental healthcare providers is indispensable."
