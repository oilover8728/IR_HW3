8860,The extent of molecular variation in novel SARS-CoV-2 after the six-month global spread.,"The pandemic spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still ongoing since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is identified as the etiologic pathogen late December 2019. After over six-month spread of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 causes critical threats to global public health and economy. The investigations on evolution and genotyping on genetic variations are of great importance, therefore, the present study characterized the molecular variation of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing 4230 complete genome sequences from the worldwide samples collected during the first 6-month pandemic. Phylogenetic tree analysis with Neighbor-Joining and Maximum-Parsimony methods indicated that the haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were classified into four clades with the unique nucleotide and amino acid changes: T27879C (ORF8 L84S) in clade 1 (25.34%), A23138G (spike D614G) in clade 2 (63.54%), G10818T (nsp6 L37F), C14540T (nsp12 T442I), and G25879T (ORF3a V251F) in clade 3 (2.58%), and miscellaneous changes in clade 4 (8.54%). Interestingly, subclade 2B with the amino acid changes at nsp2 T85I, Spike D614G, and ORF3a Q57H was firstly reported on March 4, 2020 in United States of America, becoming the most frequent sub-haplogroup in the world (36.21%) and America (45.81%). Subclade 1C with the amino acid changes at nsp13 P504L and ORF8 L84S was becoming the second most frequent sub-haplogroup in the world (19.91%) and America (26.29%). Subclade 2A with the amino acid changes in Spike D614G and Nucleocapsid R203K and G204R was highly prevalent in Asia (18.82%) and Europe (29.72%). The study highlights the notable clades and sub-clades with unique mutations, revealing the genetic and geographical relevant post the six-month outbreak of COVID-19. This study thoroughly observed the genetic feature of SARS-CoV-2 haplotyping, providing an epidemiological trend of COVID-19."
8861,COVseq is a cost-effective workflow for mass-scale SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance.,"While mass-scale vaccination campaigns are ongoing worldwide, genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical to monitor the emergence and global spread of viral variants of concern (VOC). Here, we present a streamlined workflow-COVseq-which can be used to generate highly multiplexed sequencing libraries compatible with Illumina platforms from hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 samples in parallel, in a rapid and cost-effective manner. We benchmark COVseq against a standard library preparation method (NEBNext) on 29 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, reaching 95.4% of concordance between single-nucleotide variants detected by both methods. Application of COVseq to 245 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive samples demonstrates the ability of the method to reliably detect emergent VOC as well as its compatibility with downstream phylogenetic analyses. A cost analysis shows that COVseq could be used to sequence thousands of samples at less than 15 USD per sample, including library preparation and sequencing costs. We conclude that COVseq is a versatile and scalable method that is immediately applicable for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and easily adaptable to other pathogens such as influenza viruses."

8864,The phylogenetic relationship within SARS-CoV-2s: An expanding basal clade.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) whose origin is still shed in mystery. In this study, we developed a method to search the basal SARS-CoV-2 clade among collected SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We first identified the mutation sites in the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence alignment. Then by the pairwise comparison of the numbers of mutation sites among all SARS-CoV-2s, the least mutated clade was identified, which is the basal clade under parsimony principle. In our first analysis, we used 168 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/04) to identify the basal clade which contains 33 identical viral sequences from seven countries. To our surprise, in our second analysis with 367 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/17), the basal clade has 51 viral sequences, 18 more sequences added. The much larger NCBI dataset shows that this clade has expanded with 85 unique sequences by 2020/04/04. The expanding basal clade tells a chilling fact that the least mutated SARS-CoV-2 sequence was replicating and spreading for at least four months. It is known that coronaviruses have the RNA proofreading capability to ensure their genome replication fidelity. Interestingly, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 without its nonstructural proteins 13 to 16 (Nsp13-Nsp16) exhibits an unusually high mutation rate. Our result suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has an unprecedented RNA proofreading capability which can intactly preserve its genome even after a long period of transmission. Our selection analyses also indicate that the positive selection event enabling SARS-CoV-2 to cross species and adapt to human hosts might have been achieved before its outbreak."
8865,[Clinical analysis of liver chemistries in children and adolescent with 2019-nCoV infection].,"Objective: To describe the clinical features of liver involvement in children and adolescent with 2019-nCoV infection. Methods: The clinical data of 77 hospitalized cases admitted to the Children's Hospital of Fudan University were collected from January 19 to November 28, 2020. The characteristics and risk factors of abnormal liver chemistries in children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection were analyzed. Results: Of the 77 cases, 44 were male (57.1%) and 33 were female (42.9%), with a median age of 10 years. 27(35.1%) were asymptomatic, 28(36.4%) had mild illness, 22(28.6%)had non-severe pneumonia. Hydroxychloroquine was used in 7 cases. Of the 75 children without underlying diseases, alanine aminotransferase was elevated in 1 case (1.5%, during hydroxychloroquine therapy), aspartate aminotransferase was elevated in 7 cases (10.3%), alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 7 cases (28%), and total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio were in normal range. There was no statistical difference between the pneumonia group and the non-pneumonia group in term of liver chemistries (P > 0.05), same as between the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate group and the normal group. There was no aggravation of liver injury in the child with biliary atresia. The child with epilepsy showed no abnormal liver chemistries after infection. Conclusion: Children with 2019-nCoV infection had mild clinical symptoms with few cases of liver injury. The abnormal liver chemistries in children with COVID-19 infection may be related to the underlying disease and the use of antiviral drugs."

8867,A Comprehensive Molecular Epidemiological Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021: Evidence of a Highly Polyphyletic and Evolving Epidemic.,"The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in an extraordinary global public health crisis. In early 2020, Cyprus, among other European countries, was affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and adopted lockdown measures in March 2020 to limit the initial outbreak on the island. In this study, we performed a comprehensive retrospective molecular epidemiological analysis (genetic, phylogenetic, phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses) of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Cyprus from April 2020 to January 2021, covering the first ten months of the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic on the island. The primary aim of this study was to assess the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from 596 clinical samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) obtained from community-based diagnostic testing centers and hospitalized patients. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 34 different lineages in Cyprus, with B.1.258, B.1.1.29, B.1.177, B.1.2, B.1 and B.1.1.7 (designated a Variant of Concern 202012/01, VOC) being the most prevalent lineages on the island during the study period. Phylodynamic analysis showed a highly dynamic epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with three consecutive surges characterized by specific lineages (B.1.1.29 from April to June 2020; B.1.258 from September 2020 to January 2021; and B.1.1.7 from December 2020 to January 2021). Genetic analysis of whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of the aforementioned lineages revealed the presence of mutations within the S protein (L18F, ΔH69/V70, S898F, ΔY144, S162G, A222V, N439K, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, S982A and D1118H) that confer higher transmissibility and/or antibody escape (immune evasion) upon the virus. Phylogeographic analysis indicated that the majority of imports and exports were to and from the United Kingdom (UK), although many other regions/countries were identified (southeastern Asia, southern Europe, eastern Europe, Germany, Italy, Brazil, Chile, the USA, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Finland, Switzerland and Pakistan). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 infection epidemic in Cyprus is being maintained by a continuous influx of lineages from many countries, resulting in the establishment of an ever-evolving and polyphyletic virus on the island."
8868,A novel DNA and protein combination COVID-19 vaccine formulation provides full protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques.,"The current study aims to develop a safe and highly immunogenic COVID-19 vaccine. The novel combination of a DNA vaccine encoding the full-length Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a recombinant S1 protein vaccine induced high level neutralizing antibody and T cell immune responses in both small and large animal models. More significantly, the co-delivery of DNA and protein components at the same time elicited full protection against intratracheal challenge of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in immunized rhesus macaques. As both DNA and protein vaccines have been proven safe in previous human studies, and DNA vaccines are capable of eliciting germinal center B cell development, which is critical for high-affinity memory B cell responses, the DNA and protein co-delivery vaccine approach has great potential to serve as a safe and effective approach to develop COVID-19 vaccines that provide long-term protection."
8869,Optimizing safety surveillance for COVID-19 vaccines.,Evolution of the current infrastructure for surveillance of vaccine safety will be essential to meet our commitments to the public in the deployment of a vaccine (or vaccines) to COVID-19. The incorporation of concepts and tools within the fields of data science and systems immunology can be used to propel vaccine safety monitoring into the twenty-first century.
