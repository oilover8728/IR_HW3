4431,"The Virological, Immunological, and Imaging Approaches for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Research.","In 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was found to cause a highly contagious disease characterized by pneumonia. The disease (COVID-19) quickly spread around the globe, escalating to a global pandemic. In this review, we discuss the virological, immunological, and imaging approaches harnessed for COVID-19 diagnosis and research. COVID-19 shares many clinical characteristics with other respiratory illnesses.Accurate and early detection of the infection is pivotal to controlling the outbreak, as this enables case identification, isolation, and contact tracing. We summarize the available literature on current laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics, highlight their strengths and limitations, and describe the emerging diagnostic approaches on the horizon.We also discuss the various research techniques that are being used to evaluate host immunity in laboratory-confirmed patients. Additionally, pathological imaging of tissue samples from affected patients has a critical role in guiding investigations on this disease. Conventional techniques, such as immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, have been frequently used to characterize the immune microenvironment in COVID-19. We also outline the emerging imaging techniques, such as the RNAscope, which might also aid in our understanding of the significance of COVID-19-specific biomarkers, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor.Overall, great progress has been made in COVID-19 research in a short period. Extensive, global collation of our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 will provide insights into novel treatment modalities, such as monoclonal antibodies, and support the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."

4433,Considerations from the College of American Pathologists for Implementation of an Assay for SARS-CoV-2 Testing after a Change in Regulatory Status.,"The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the marketing of manufacturers' in vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs), including assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The U.S. government's Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 regulates the studies that a clinical diagnostic laboratory needs to perform for an IVD before placing it into use. Until recently, the FDA has authorized the marketing of SARS-CoV-2 IVDs exclusively through the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway. The regulatory landscape continues to evolve, and IVDs will eventually be required to pass through conventional non-EUA FDA review pathways once the emergency declaration is terminated, in order to continue to be marketed as an IVD in the United States. When FDA regulatory status of an IVD changes or is anticipated to change, the laboratory should review manufacturer information and previously performed internal verification studies to determine what, if any, additional studies are needed before implementing the non-EUA version of the IVD in accordance with CLIA regulations. Herein, the College of American Pathologists' Microbiology Committee provides guidance for how to approach regulatory considerations when an IVD is converted from EUA to non-EUA status."

4436,COVID-19 vaccines that reduce symptoms but do not block infection need higher coverage and faster rollout to achieve population impact.,"Trial results for two COVID-19 vaccines suggest at least 90% efficacy against symptomatic disease (VEDIS). It remains unknown whether this efficacy is mediated by lowering SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility (VESUSC) or development of symptoms after infection (VESYMP). We aim to assess and compare the population impact of vaccines with different efficacy profiles (VESYMP and VESUSC) satisfying licensure criteria. We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to data from King County, Washington. Rollout scenarios starting December 2020 were simulated with combinations of VESUSC and VESYMP resulting in up to 100% VEDIS. We assumed no reduction of infectivity upon infection conditional on presence of symptoms. Proportions of cumulative infections, hospitalizations and deaths prevented over 1 year from vaccination start are reported. Rollouts of 1 M vaccinations (5000 daily) using vaccines with 50% VEDIS are projected to prevent 23-46% of infections and 31-46% of deaths over 1 year. In comparison, vaccines with 90% VEDIS are projected to prevent 37-64% of infections and 46-64% of deaths over 1 year. In both cases, there is a greater reduction if VEDIS is mediated mostly by VESUSC. The use of a ""symptom reducing"" vaccine will require twice as many people vaccinated than a ""susceptibility reducing"" vaccine with the same 90% VEDIS to prevent 50% of the infections and death over 1 year. Delaying the start of the vaccination by 3 months decreases the expected population impact by more than 50%. Vaccines which prevent COVID-19 disease but not SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thereby shift symptomatic infections to asymptomatic infections, will prevent fewer infections and require larger and faster vaccination rollouts to have population impact, compared to vaccines that reduce susceptibility to infection. If uncontrolled transmission across the U.S. continues, then expected vaccination in Spring 2021 will provide only limited benefit."
4437,Evaluation of rapid antigen test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus.,"Background: The rapid diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is essential to reduce the disease spread. Rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests are available, however, there is scanty data on the performance of RAD tests. Objective: To evaluate the performance of the commercially available BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag test and compare it with RT-PCR for detecting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Analytical sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus was determined for the RAD test using viral culture and RT-PCR as reference methods. The RAD test was further evaluated using respiratory samples collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients. The results were compared with RT-PCR test. Results: The detection limits between RAD test, viral culture and RT-PCR varied hugely. RAD was 103 fold less sensitive than viral culture while RAD was 105 fold less sensitive than RT-PCR. The RAD test detected between 11.1 % and 45.7 % of RT-PCR-positive samples from COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the RAD test serves only as adjunct to RT-PCR test because of potential for false-negative results."
4438,Clinical outcomes of non-diabetic COVID-19 patients with different blood glucose levels: a nationwide Turkish study (TurCoGlycemia).,"Purpose: New coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a worse prognosis in patients with diabetes. However, there are insufficient data about the effect of hyperglycemia on COVID-19 prognosis in non-diabetic patients. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between random blood glucose levels measured at the time of diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease in non-diabetic patients. Methods: A nationwide retrospective cohort of non-diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 30 May 2020 in the Turkish Ministry of Health database was investigated. The patients were stratified into three groups according to blood glucose levels which were <100 mg/dL in group-1, in the range of 100-139 mg/dl in group-2, and the range of 140-199 mg/dl in group-3. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared among the groups. The primary outcome was mortality. Results: A total of 12,817 non-diabetic patients (median age [IQR]: 44 [25] years, females: 50.9%) were included. Patients in group-2 (5%) and group-3 (14%) had higher mortality rates than patients in group-1 (2.1%). The rates of hospitalization, hospital stays longer than 8 days, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay more than 6 days, and mechanical ventilation were also significantly higher in group-3 patients. Likewise, glucose levels in the range of 140-199 mg/dL were an independent associate of mortality and composite of ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: Hyperglycemia at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis is associated with poor prognosis in non-diabetic patients. Clinicians should be more careful in the treatment of non-diabetic COVID-19 patients with hyperglycemia."
4439,Optimizing COVID-19 vaccine distribution across the United States using deterministic and stochastic recurrent neural networks.,"Optimizing COVID-19 vaccine distribution can help plan around the limited production and distribution of vaccination, particularly in early stages. One of the main criteria for equitable vaccine distribution is predicting the geographic distribution of active virus at the time of vaccination. This research developed sequence-learning models to predict the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic across the US, based on previously reported information. For this objective, we used two time-series datasets of confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers from January 22, 2020 to November 26, 2020 for all states in the US. The datasets have 310 time-steps (days) and 50 features (US states). To avoid training the models for all states, we categorized US states on the basis of their similarity to previously reported COVID-19 behavior. For this purpose, we used an unsupervised self-organizing map to categorize all states of the US into four groups on the basis of the similarity of their effective reproduction numbers. After selecting a leading state (the state with earliest outbreaks) in each group, we developed deterministic and stochastic Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Mixture Density Network (MDN) models. We trained the models with data from each leading state to make predictions, then compared the models with a baseline linear regression model. We also remove seasonality and trends from a dataset of non-stationary COVID-19 cases to determine the effects on prediction. We showed that the deterministic LSTM model trained on the COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers outperforms other prediction methods."
