3150,Predictors of SARS-CoV-2 Positivity Based on RT-PCR Swab Tests at a Drive-Through Outpatient Clinic for COVID-19 Screening in Japan.,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, we conducted drive-through nasopharyngeal swab testing for COVID-19 in Sendai city, Japan, since April 2020. All tested individuals were judged in advance by public health centers for the necessity of undergoing the test with possible contact history and/or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. In this study, to identify the predictors of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity for more efficient and evidenced selection of suspected individuals, we enrolled 3,540 consecutive individuals, tested in the first 7 months of the testing program, with data regarding to the history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, including those involved in cluster outbreaks. This cohort included 284 foreign students (257 males and 27 females) from a vocational school involved in the largest cluster outbreak in the area. Close contact history was present in 952 (26.9%) of the participants. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results showed that 164 participants (4.6%) were positive and 3,376 participants (95.4%) were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene (N2). In the univariate and multivariate analyses, history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, higher age, cough symptoms, and non-native ethnicity were predictors for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. However, the significance of age and foreign nationality disappeared or declined upon excluding the foreign students from the aforementioned largest cluster outbreak. In conclusion, a history of close contact with COVID-19 patients and the presence of cough symptoms are significant predictors of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity."
3151,[Consolidated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Vaccines and Immunization Strategies- on prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination].,"COVID-19 is a global public health issue due to its epidemic nature that, to date, lacks pharmacological treatment. However, some COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, although the duration of their protection, their ability to interrupt viral transmission, and their efficacy against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being studied. Chile's SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign required design and planning, like any other campaign. This process included the prioritization of risk groups for vaccination given the limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines globally. Throughout 2020, CAVEI issued recommendations on the prioritization of population groups to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 in response to different needs and in accordance with available evidence. These recommendations are consolidated in Table 1 in this report. In summary, it was recommended that healthcare workers, people in long-term residences and essential State personnel be vaccinated in phase 1. In phase 2, persons over 65 years of age and people with comorbidities. In phase 3, essential tasks workers and, lastly, the general population."
3152,"A Cluster Transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Prevention and Control Measures in the Early Stage of the Epidemic in Xi'an, China, 2020.","BACKGROUND At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a cluster outbreak caused by an imported case from Hubei Province was reported in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, China. Ten patients from 2 families and 1 hospital were involved in the transmission. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted an epidemiological investigation to identify the cluster transmission of COVID-19. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and cluster characteristics were described and analyzed. RESULTS From January 27 to February 13, 2020, a total of 10 individuals were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 families and 1 hospital. Among the confirmed cases, 7 had atypical clinical symptoms and 3 were asymptomatic. The median times from onset to diagnosis and to discharge were 3.5 days (range, 1-5 days) and 19.5 days (range, 16-38 days), respectively. There were 4 patients whose exposure dates were 1, 3, 3, and 2 days earlier than the onset dates of their previous-generation cases, respectively. Four prevention and control measures were effectively used to interrupt the disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 can be easily transmitted within families and in hospitals, and asymptomatic patients could act as a source of disease transmission. The results of this outbreak at the early epidemic stage support the recommendation that individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and all their close contacts should be subjected to medical quarantined observation and nucleic acid screening as early as possible, even if they do not have any symptoms. Meanwhile, people in high-risk areas should improve their protective measures."
3153,Report of death in children with SARS-CoV-2 and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) coinfection: Is hMPV the trigger?,"In the last month of 2019, a new virus called SARS‐CoV‐2 was discovered in Wuhan, China. This virus causes a wide range of symptoms, and respiratory tract illness is the most common disorder. To investigate the presence of other respiratory viruses, we performed a panel of virus detection through PCR and RT‐PCR tests to detect influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, Human metapneumovirus, Human bocavirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus on nasopharyngeal swabs of all 74 SARS‐CoV‐2 positive dead patients. Here we report an interesting finding of the co‐infection of SARS‐CoV‐2 and Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in three deceased children in North Khorasan Province, Iran.

3154,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Particles Using Direct, Reagent-Free Electrochemical Sensing.","The development of new methods for direct viral detection using streamlined and ideally reagent-free assays is a timely and important, but challenging, problem. The challenge of combatting the COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the lack of rapid and effective methods to identify viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 on-demand. Existing gold standard nucleic acid-based approaches require enzymatic amplification to achieve clinically relevant levels of sensitivity and are not typically used outside of a laboratory setting. Here, we report reagent-free viral sensing that directly reads out the presence of viral particles in 5 minutes using only a sensor-modified electrode chip. The approach relies on a class of electrode-tethered sensors bearing an analyte-binding antibody displayed on a negatively charged DNA linker that also features a tethered redox probe. When a positive potential is applied, the sensor is transported to the electrode surface. Using chronoamperometry, the presence of viral particles and proteins can be detected as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag on the sensor. This report is the first virus-detecting assay that uses the kinetic response of a probe/virus complex to analyze the complexation state of the antibody. We demonstrate the performance of this sensing approach as a means to detect, within 5 min, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated spike protein in test samples and in unprocessed patient saliva."
3155,Rationale Use of Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio for early diagnosis and stratification of COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease is caused by a virus that is the cause of a potentially fatal disease worldwide. Coronavirus is a pathogen that primarily affects the human respiratory system. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been named WHO since February 11, 2020. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in December 2019. In January 2020, COVID-19 infection was identified in hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China. We analyze the role of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in viral infection with special emphasize on novel corona virus disease-COVID-19. NLR may be used for early detection and may reflect progression to the more severe illness leading to SARS-CoV-2. In the mini review we investigate the use of NLR as a surrogate marker for diagnosis and stratification of COVID-19.Clinical symptoms such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart damage have led to death. In some cases, multiple inflammations have been observed. Treatment with interferon inhalation showed no clinical effect and the condition worsened instead (Tab. 5, Fig. 1, Ref. 18). Keywords: neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, corona virus SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19."
3156,Does mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine influence patients' performance during IVF-ET cycle?,"Objective: No information exists in the literature regarding the effect of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on subsequent IVF cycle attempt. We therefore aim to assess the influence of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on IVF treatments. Design: An observational study. Setting: A tertiary, university-affiliated medical center. Patients and methods: All couples undergoing consecutive ovarian stimulation cycles for IVF before and after receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and reached the ovum pick-up (OPU) stage. The stimulation characteristics and embryological variables of couples undergoing IVF treatments after receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were assessed and compared to their IVF cycles prior to vaccination. Main outcome measures: Stimulation characteristics and embryological variables. Results: Thirty-six couples resumed IVF treatment 7-85 days after receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. No in-between cycles differences were observed in ovarian stimulation and embryological variables before and after receiving mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Conclusions: mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not affect patients' performance or ovarian reserve in their immediate subsequent IVF cycle. Future larger studies with longer follow-up will be needed to validate our observations."

3158,Determining the frequency of serious adverse reactions of inactive SARS-COV-2 vaccine.,"Background: Vaccines are a new combat strategy against COVID-19. The success of a large number of vaccines and the continued development of vaccines will change the course of the current pandemic. Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions caused by the administration of inactive vaccine administration on healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The prospective study was conducted among healthcare professionals working in city a Training and Research Hospital and applied to have the second dose of CoronaVac vaccine. The number of personnel included in the study were 329. The data were recorded in the SPSS 23 program and the chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results: The average age of the participants in the study was 35.77±9.07. Of the participants, 28.1%were physicians. The frequency ratio of those who stated that they had serious adverse reactions after vaccination was 33.2%. Three most common systemic serious adverse reactions were headache, state of sleep/fatigue, and nausea and vomiting respectively. Serious adverse reactions occurred within 1.14±04 days after vaccine administration. The average duration of serious adverse reactions was determined as 1.68±0.77 days. 62.2%of the participants with serious side effects were women (p < 0.001). Of the participants who had serious adverse reactions, 77.5%were health care professionals (p < 0.01). Conclusion: No life-threatening serious adverse reaction was determined regarding the CoronaVac vaccine administered in this study. However, local serious adverse reactions, nausea/vomiting, fever and sleepiness/fatigue occurred frequently. Further studies are required on the newly introduced vaccine."
3159,Pre-Operative SARS CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction: A conundrum in surgical decision making.,"Purpose: Since the eye is in close proximity to the oro-nasal cavity, transmission of SARS CoV-2 is higher during ophthalmic surgical procedures, it is vital to ensure the safety of the healthcare team by pre-operative Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA of all patients planned for elective or emergency surgery. Hence, understanding the profile of pre-operative RAT and real-time RT-PCR among patients planned for various ophthalmic procedures, will help us make better decisions for future guidelines, for optimal planning of ophthalmic elective or emergency surgeries, keeping in mind the current scenario. Methods: This is a prospective descriptive study conducted on patients planned for elective or emergency ophthalmic surgeries, who had no COVID-19-related symptoms pre-operatively and were subjected to preoperative RAT and real-time RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA. Data was compiled and statistically analysed. Results: 204 patients underwent pre-operative RAT and RT-PCR testing; of which, 85 were females and 119 were males. Mean age of the study population was 51.44 ± 16.501 years. Among the 204, 2 tested positive for SARS CoV-2 with Rapid Antigen testing as well as RT-PCR and 10 patients tested positive via RT-PCR after a negative RAT result of the same sample. Conclusion: Pre-operative testing for COVID-19 disease is indispensable as there is a high chance of transmission from patient to healthcare workers. RAT has the advantage of quick results and may play a role in case of emergency procedures. However, it is prudent to perform the more sensitive real-time RT-PCR before any elective, non-emergency procedures or surgeries to avoid any undue risk to the healthcare team."
