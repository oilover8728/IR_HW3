7351,COVID-19 and central nervous system interplay: A big picture beyond clinical manifestation.,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) has been declared a pandemic. Global research updates confirm that the infected patients manifest a range of clinical symptoms and sometimes remain entirely asymptomatic, posing a greater threat to the people coming in contact. Despite several case reports coming up every day, our knowledge about the neurotropic mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2, immunological responses, and the mode of disease progression and mechanism of crosstalk between the central nervous system (CNS), heart, lungs, and other major organs is not complete. Report of anosmia, ataxia, dysgeusia, and altered psychological status of the infected COVID-19 patients offers some clue to the possible route of viral entry and multiplication. In this review, we have critically assessed the involvement of CNS dysregulation in COVID-19 patients. The probable mechanism of immunological responses, the impairment of the coagulation pathway, the onset of cytokine storm, its interplay with the HPA axis, and hypoxia are discussed in detail here. Based on the latest research findings and some case reports of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is evident that the CNS involvement in disease progression is alarming. Accurate and timely detection of viral load in CNS is necessary to allow prompt and effective treatment modalities."
7352,"Comparison of eight commercial, high-throughput, automated or ELISA assays detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgG or total antibody.","Background: Many commercial assays, of different designs, detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies exist but with little experience with them. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of assays detecting IgG or total antibodies to N or S antigens, validated for routine use in France, with samples from subjects with more or less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Eight assays were used: Abbott Architect, DiaSorin Liaison®, bioMérieux Vidas®, Roche Elecsys Cobas®, Siemens Atellica®, BioRad Platelia ELISA, Epitope Diagnostics ELISA, and Wantai ELISA. The tested population included 86 samples from 40 hospitalized subjects and 28 outpatients at different time from symptom onset. Results: The positivity rate varied depending on the assay but was greater for all assays in hospitalized than non-hospitalized patients. Despite a good correlation between the assays, discrepancies occurred, without a systematic origin, even for samples taken more than 20 days after symptom onset. These discrepancies were linked to low antibody levels in pauci-symptomatic patients. Conclusion: Whichever assay is chosen, a false negative result may need to be ruled out with another test in a risk situation."
7353,"Analysis of the positive rate of 4254 cases of COVID-19 nucleic acid tests in different aites in Wuhan, China.","There's an outbreak of coronavirus diesase 2019 (COVID-19) since December 2019, first in Wuhan. It has caused huge medical challenges to Hubei Province with currently more than 67 thousand confirmed cases till 8th March 2020. Identification, there is no clinically effective drug. Isolation and masks are essential to limit human-to-human transmission initially. The nucleic acid test (NAT) of COVID-19 currently was the most reliable established laboratory diagnosis method in clinical. From 8th February to 7th March 2020, 4254 cases were collected for analysis at six nucleic acid collection sites in the community medical team of Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which cover almost all groups who need NAT in Wuhan. Distribution of positive rates in different sites by genders, ages, or occupations were compared. The positive rates of different sites from high to low were: hospital wards (24.71%) > fever clinics (16.57%) > nursing homes (5.51%) > isolation hotels (5.30%) > rehabilitation stations (1.36%) >close contact sites (0.17%). The confirmed patients in isolation hotels, hospital ward, and fever clinical were mainly middle-aged and elderly, and most of them were women. The positive rate in isolation hotels and fever clinics gradually decreased over time. There were no significant differences between genders among those six nucleic acid collection sites (P < .05). The hospital wards have the highest positive rate; however, close contact sites have lowest one. Patients who are discharged from hospitals may still have potential risks. Middle-aged and older people remain the focus of epidemic prevention and control."
7354,COVID-19-associated inflammatory syndrome in an adult woman with unexplained multiple organ failure: staying vigilant for COVID-19 complications as the pandemic surges.,"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, clinicians have been challenged with a wide spectrum of disease severity. One of the serious complications associated with the virus is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). It is characterised by inflammation leading to organ damage, in the setting of positive SARS-CoV-2 infection. MIS-C is thought to be a postviral reaction where most children are negative on PCR testing but are positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently defined the same phenomenon occurring in adults as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) and emphasised on the use of antibody testing in this population. Here we describe an adult woman with an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 who presented with unexplained organ failure and shock. Positive antibody testing was the only clue to the diagnosis of MIS-A. We stress the importance of SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection in order to identify these cases."

7356,Increasing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio: COVID-19 Clinical Synopsis for Outpatient Providers.,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19 formally 2019-nCoV), has received widespread attention from the medical community. Despite the rapid publication of research on the virus and the disease it causes, there is a lack of concise and relevant material to help busy medical providers navigate recognition and management of the disease in the ambulatory setting. This review article aims to bridge this gap by briefly reviewing the key points of the evaluation and treatment of patients with COVID-19 in the ambulatory clinic environment."
7357,Autopsy in suspected COVID-19 cases.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries across the world including the UK with an increasing death toll. This will inevitably lead to an increase in the number of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related deaths at autopsy. The Royal College of Pathologists has responded to this concern with the release of a briefing on autopsy practice relating to COVID-19. The following article is a summary and interpretation of these guidelines. It includes a description of hazard group 3 organisms, the category to which SARS-CoV-2 has been assigned, a brief description of what is currently known about the pathological and autopsy findings in COVID-19, a summary of the recommendations for conducting autopsies in suspected COVID-19 cases and the techniques for making the diagnosis at autopsy. It concludes by considering the clinicopathological correlation and notification of such cases."
7358,Evaluating the Need for Routine COVID-19 Testing of Emergency Department Staff: Quantitative Analysis.,"Background: As the number of COVID-19 cases in the US continues to increase and hospitals experience shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), health care workers have been disproportionately affected. However, since COVID-19 testing is now easily available, there is a need to evaluate whether routine testing should be performed for asymptomatic health care workers. Objective: This study aimed to provide a quantitative analysis of the predicted impact that regular testing of health care workers for COVID-19 may have on the prevention of the disease among emergency department patients and staff. Methods: Using publicly available data on COVID-19 cases and emergency department visits, as well as internal hospital staffing information, we developed a mathematical model to predict the impact of periodic COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic staff members of the emergency department in COVID-19-affected regions. We calculated various transmission constants based on the Diamond Princess cruise ship data, used a logistic model to calculate new infections, and developed a Markov model based on the average incubation period for COVID-19. Results: Our model predicts that after 180 days, with a transmission constant of 1.219e-4 new infections/person2, weekly COVID-19 testing of health care workers would reduce new health care worker and patient infections by approximately 3%-5.9%, and biweekly testing would reduce infections in both by 1%-2.1%. At a transmission constant of 3.660e-4 new infections/person2, weekly testing would reduce infections by 11%-23% and biweekly testing would reduce infections by 5.5%-13%. At a lower transmission constant of 4.067e-5 new infections/person2, weekly and biweekly COVID-19 testing for health care workers would result in an approximately 1% and 0.5%-0.8% reduction in infections, respectively. Conclusions: Periodic COVID-19 testing for emergency department staff in regions that are heavily affected by COVID-19 or are facing resource constraints may significantly reduce COVID-19 transmission among health care workers and previously uninfected patients."
7359,Biological Aging Predicts Vulnerability to COVID-19 Severity in UK Biobank Participants.,"Background: Age and disease prevalence are the 2 biggest risk factors for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptom severity and death. We therefore hypothesized that increased biological age, beyond chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity. Methods: Using the UK Biobank England data, we tested whether a biological age estimate (PhenoAge) measured more than a decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was predictive of 2 COVID-19 severity outcomes (inpatient test positivity and COVID-19-related mortality with inpatient test-confirmed COVID-19). Logistic regression models were used with adjustment for age at the pandemic, sex, ethnicity, baseline assessment centers, and preexisting diseases/conditions. Results: Six hundred and thirteen participants tested positive at inpatient settings between March 16 and April 27, 2020, 154 of whom succumbed to COVID-19. PhenoAge was associated with increased risks of inpatient test positivity and COVID-19-related mortality (ORMortality = 1.63 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.43-1.86, p = 4.7 × 10-13) adjusting for demographics including age at the pandemic. Further adjustment for preexisting diseases/conditions at baseline (ORM = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.30-1.73 per 5 years, p = 3.1 × 10-8) and at the early pandemic (ORM = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40 per 5 years, p = .011) decreased the association. Conclusions: PhenoAge measured in 2006-2010 was associated with COVID-19 severity outcomes more than 10 years later. These associations were partly accounted for by prevalent chronic diseases proximate to COVID-19 infection. Overall, our results suggest that aging biomarkers, like PhenoAge may capture long-term vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, even before the accumulation of age-related comorbid conditions."
