Here, three children with COVID‐19 infection, ages 2 to 12 years, were prospectively followed from hospital admission to discharge. We provide information and experience with treatment of pediatric cases with confirmed COVID‐19 infection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
7922,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Farmed Mink (Neovison vison), Poland.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease and has been spreading worldwide since December 2019. The virus can infect different animal species under experimental conditions, and mink on fur farms in Europe and other areas are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection in 91 mink from a farm in northern Poland. Using reverse transcription PCR, antigen detection, and next-generation sequencing, we confirmed that 15 animals were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We verified this finding by sequencing full viral genomes and confirmed a virus variant that has sporadic mutations through the full genome sequence in the spike protein (G75V and C1247F). We were unable to find other SARS-CoV-2 sequences simultaneously containing these 2 mutations. Country-scale monitoring by veterinary inspection should be implemented to detect SARS-CoV-2 in other mink farms."
7923,The Psychosocial Impact of COVID-19 on health care workers.,"At the end of 2019, a disease was identified, COVID-19, caused by a new type of easy and fast spreading virus, which led to the beginning of a worldwide pandemic. One of the most exposed groups to the virus and its psychosocial consequences is the healthcare workers, due to their implication in caring for affected people. Health workers are exposed to a fast and unpredictable situation that requires more human resources and materials than usual, however, the lack of means on account to this situation entails an increased probability of suffering different consequences, including the burnout syndrome, to which, generally, this professionals are already vulnerable. In addition, quarantine is added as a measure to prevent the spread of the pandemic, which is another handicap for healthcare workers. Quarantine means these professionals are more likely to suffer the foreseeable psychological consequences in general population, specifically, it has been observed that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is more prevalent, because of the stress load of the situation experienced."
7924,Cell Population Data and Serum Polyclonal Immunoglobulin Free Light Chains in the Assessment of COVID-19 Severity.,"Distinguishing between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 to ensure adequate healthcare quality and efficiency is a challenge for the healthcare system. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of CBC parameters together with analysis of FLC serum concentration in risk stratification of COVID-19. Materials and methods: CBC was analyzed in 735 COVID ICU, COVID non-ICU, and non-COVID ICU cases. FLC concentration was analyzed in 133 of them. Results: COVID ICU had neutrophils and lymphocytes with the greatest size, granularity, and nucleic acid content. Significant differences in concentrations of κ and λ FLCs were shown between COVID ICU and COVID non-ICU. However, no difference was found in the κ/λ ratio between these groups, and the ratio stayed within the reference value, which indicates the presence of polyclonal FLCs. FLC κ measurement has significant power to distinguish between severe COVID-19 and nonsevere COVID-19 (AUC = 0.7669), with a sensitivity of 86.67% and specificity of 93.33%. The κ coefficients' odds ratio of 3.0401 was estimated. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the results obtained from the measure of free light immunoglobulin concentration in serum are useful in distinguishing between severe and nonsevere COVID-19."

7926,Immunity against seasonal human coronavirus OC43 mitigates fatal deterioration of COVID-19.,"Background: The effects of high-intensity immunity on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unclear. Antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are preferentially induced in inpatients with COVID-19 compared with outpatients with milder disease, and immunosuppression is the standard therapy for severe cases. This study investigated the relationship between cross-reactive antibody production against seasonal human coronavirus and the clinical course of COVID-19. Methods: Among the immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2, conserved peptides in human coronavirus OC43 were searched and synthesized. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was designed to detect antibodies against synthesized peptides. Antibody titres against S2' cleavage site epitopes near fusion peptides of SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 were determined in the sera of 126 inpatients with COVID-19. The correlation between antibody titres and clinical data was analysed. Results: Inpatients with COVID-19 who produced antibodies against OC43 did not develop severe or fatal pneumonia. Antibody titres against the corresponding epitope of SARS-CoV-2 did not differ between inpatients with severe and mild COVID-19. Antibody titres against the OC43 epitope increased more than those against SARS-CoV-2 during the first 2 weeks of COVID-19. Conclusions: Immunity to seasonal human coronavirus OC43 effectively enhanced recovery from COVID-19. Detecting cross-reactive antibodies to OC43 may help to predict prognosis for patients with COVID-19."
7927,School in Italy: a safe place for children and adolescents.,"Background: During the first SARS-CoV-2 pandemic phase, the sudden closure of schools was one of the main measures to minimize the spread of the virus. In the second phase, several safety procedures were implemented to avoid school closure. To evaluate if the school is a safe place, students and staff of two school complexes of Rome were monitored to evaluate the efficacy of prevention measures inside the school buildings. Methods: Oral secretions specimens were collected from 1262 subjects for a total of 3431 samples, collected over a 3 months period. Detection of Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time PCR. Target genes were represented by E gene, RdRP/S gene and N gene. Results: Among the 3431 samples analyzed, just 16 sample resulted as positive or low positive: 1 sample in the first month, 12 samples in the second month and 3 in the third month. In each period of evaluation, all positive children attended different classes. Conclusions: Even if the school has the potential for spreading viruses, our preliminary results show the efficacy of the implementations undertaken in this setting to minimize virus diffusion. Our evidence suggests that school does not act as an amplifier for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and can be really considered a safe place for students."

7929,Transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 and protective measures in dental clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Results: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a primary challenging public health issue for not only China but also the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the pandemic of COVID-19 had become a public health emergency of global concern. As of May 12, 2020 COVID-19 has been reported in over 180 countries/regions, with a total of 4,178,156 confirmed cases and over 280,000 deaths. The risk of cross-infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be elevated between dental specialists and patients due to the peculiarity of dental practice. Therefore, detailed and effective infection control measures are imminently needed to prevent nosocomial coronavirus infection. This paper, based on proven effective experience, relevant guidelines, and research, not only presents the fundamental knowledge about the name, etiologic characteristics, epidemiologic characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, transmission routes and risk points of SARS-CoV-2 in dental clinics but also provides recommended protective measures for dental professionals to interdict the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in dental clinics. Classification schemes as well as color identification according to the results of the questionnaire survey and temperature measurement in precheck and triages are innovations proposed in this paper. Clinical significance: This paper, based on proven effective experience, relevant guidelines, and research, not only presents the fundamental knowledge about the name, etiologic characteristics, epidemiologic characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, transmission routes and risk points of SARS-CoV-2 in dental clinics but also provides recommended protective measures for dental professionals to interdict the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in dental clinics."
