6780,The Molecular Interplay between Human Coronaviruses and Autophagy.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has instantaneously emerged as a worldwide pandemic. However, humans encountered other coronaviruses in the past, and they caused a broad range of symptoms, from mild to life-threatening, depending on the virus and immunocompetence of the host. Most human coronaviruses interact with the proteins and/or double-membrane vesicles of autophagy, the membrane trafficking pathway that degrades and recycles the intracellular protein aggregates, organelles, and pathogens, including viruses. However, coronaviruses often neutralize and hijack this pathway to complete their life cycle. In this review, we discuss the interactions of human coronaviruses and autophagy, including recent data from SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Some of these interactions (for example, viral block of the autophagosome-lysosome fusion), while being conserved across multiple coronaviruses, are accomplished via different molecular mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular interplay between human coronaviruses and autophagy for developing efficient therapies against coronaviral diseases."

6784,Major cluster of paediatric 'true' primary chilblains during the COVID-19 pandemic: a consequence of lifestyle changes due to lockdown.,"Background: Over the last months, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of chilblain-like lesions were reported mainly in children and rarely in young adults. The relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection was postulated, often without any laboratory, instrumental or clinical confirmation. The disclosure of information about chilblain-like lesions as a COVID-19 manifestation in social media has created concern in children's families and paediatricians. Objectives: To verify whether the chilblain-like lesions were caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Prospective study on a case series including children who presented with acral lesions at the Pediatric Dermatology Outpatient and Pediatric Emergency Unit of the University of Bologna, from 1 April to 30 April 2020. We reported demographical, laboratory and clinical features, history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, presence of similar skin lesions in other family members, precipitating and risk factors for chilblain onset. Results: We evaluated eight patients (five females, three males) aged between 11 and 15 years. We excluded acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab, serum antibody levels using chemiluminescent immunoassays. Other acute infections causing purpuric lesions at the extremities were negative in all patients. Skin lesion biopsy for histological and immunohistochemical evaluation was made in two cases and was consistent with chilblain. PCR assay on skin lesion biopsy for parvovirus B19, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a patient and resulted negative. We identified common precipitating and risk factors: physical (cold and wet extremities, low BMI), cold and wet indoor and outdoor environment, behaviours, habits and lifestyle. We therefore reached a diagnosis of primary chilblains. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a 'cluster' of primary chilblains developed in predisposed subjects, mainly teenagers, due to cold exposure in the lockdown period. Laboratory findings support our hypothesis, although it is also possible that an unknown infectious trigger may have contributed to the pathogenesis."
6785,Current status of the lateral flow immunoassay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs.,"Early detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are priorities during the pandemic. Symptomatic and suspected asymptomatic individuals should be tested for COVID-19 to confirm infection and to be excluded from social interactions. As molecular testing capacity is overloaded during the pandemic, rapid antigen tests, such as lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs), can be a useful tool as they allow greater test availability and obtain results in a very short time. This short review aims to present the analytical properties of LFIAs in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. Lateral flow immunoassay is a method that combines thin-layer chromatography and indirect immunochemical sandwich method and allows the detection of a specific SARS-CoV-2 antigen in nasopharyngeal swabs. Swab specimens should be adequately collected and tested as soon as possible. Users should pay attention to quality control and possible interferences. Antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 show high sensitivity and specificity in cases with high viral loads, and should be used up to five days after the onset of the first symptoms of COVID-19. False positive results may be obtained when screening large populations with a low prevalence of COVID-19 infection, while false negative results may happen due to improper specimen collection or insufficient amount of antigen in the specimen. So as to achieve reliable results, a diagnostic accuracy study of a specific rapid antigen test should be performed."

6788,[The diagnostic value of rapid anti IgM and IgG detecting tests in the identification of patients with SARS CoV-2 virus infection].,"Introduction: At the end of March, 2020, rapid tests detecting the presence of antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus were introduced in Hungary for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease). Aim: We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection. Method: Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively. (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively. (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene'.) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively. At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively. Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 v√≠rus infection in the general population. These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection.

6789,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin antibodies in Wuhan, China: part of the city-wide massive testing campaign.","Objectives: The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Wuhan, China, has subsided after being hard hit by the disease and subsequent city lockdown. Information on the number of people involved in Wuhan is still inadequate. This study aimed to describe the screening results of 61 437 community members in Wuchang District, Wuhan. Methods: In mid-May 2020, Wuhan launched a population-scale city-wide SARS-CoV-2 testing campaign, which aimed to perform nucleic acid and viral antibody testing for citizens in Wuhan. Here we show the screening results of cluster sampling of 61 437 residents in Wuchang District, Wuhan, China. Results: A total of 1470 (2.39%, 95% CI 2.27-2.52) individuals were detected positive for at least one antiviral antibody. Among the positive individuals, 324 (0.53%, 95% CI 0.47-0.59) and 1200 (1.95%, 95% CI 1.85-2.07) were positive for immunoglobulin IgM and IgG, respectively, and 54 (0.08%, 95% CI 0.07-0.12) were positive for both antibodies. The positive rate of female carriers of antibodies was higher than those of male counterparts (male-to-female ratio of 0.75), especially in elderly citizens (ratio of 0.18 in 90+ age subgroup), indicating a sexual discrepancy in seroprevalence. In addition, viral nucleic acid detection using real-time PCR had showed 8 (0.013%, 95% CI 0.006-0.026) asymptomatic virus carriers. Discussion: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan was low. Most Wuhan residents are still susceptible to this virus. Precautions, such as wearing mask, frequent hand hygiene and proper social distance, are necessary before an effective vaccine or antiviral treatments are available."
