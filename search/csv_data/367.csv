3661,Comparing SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Anterior Nasal Vestibular Swabs vs. Oropharyngeal Swabs.,"Purpose: To investigate the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing in specimens collected from the anterior nasal vestibules of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed on 30 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from March 14, 2020 to March 21, 2020. Paired specimens were collected from both the anterior nasal vestibule and the oropharynx from all patients. All specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Results: Of the 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 17 patients (56.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 when oropharyngeal specimens were used, while 20 patients (66.7%) tested positive when nasal swab specimens were used. There was no statistically significant difference in sensitivity between the two methods. Conclusions: Respiratory swabs collected from the nasal vestibule offer a less invasive alternative to oropharyngeal swabs for specimen collection in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and have adequate sensitivity."
3662,SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test: High sensitivity to detect infectious virus.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid, cost effective and easy-to-use diagnostic tools for SARS-CoV-2 infections that can be used in point of care settings to limit disease transmission. Objective: We evaluated two rapid antigen immunochromatographic tests, Abbott Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Panbio) and Zhejiang Orient Gene/Healgen Biotech Coronavirus Ag rapid test cassette (Orient gene) for detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2. Results: The tests were evaluated on nasopharyngeal samples taken from individuals having respiratory and/or COVID-19 related symptoms, which had been analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real-time PCR. In total 156 PCR-positive, and 130 (Panbio) and 176 (Orient Gene) PCR-negative samples were analyzed. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 71.8% and 100% for Panbio and 79.5% and 74.4% for the Orient Gene test respectively. The false positives by the Orient Gene test were verified as SARS-CoV-2 negative by in-house real-time PCR assay and were negative for the four seasonal coronaviruses. Subgroup analysis revealed that the antigen tests had high sensitivity for samples with Ct-values <25 (>88%) and for samples containing infectious viruses as determined by cultivation on Vero cells, 94.1% and 97.1% for the Panbio and Orient gene tests, respectively. Furthermore, both tests had a sensitivity of <50 picogram for nucleocapsid protein. No sample with a Ct-value >27 was shown to contain infectious virus. Conclusion: The results indicate that the rapid antigen tests, especially the Panbio tests may be a valuable tool to detect contagious persons during the ongoing pandemic."

Methods: The ELISA was based on serum IgG reactivity to a 46-kDa protein derived from the recombinant SARS-CoV2 nucleoprotein. Assay sensitivity was assessed using serum samples from 134 COVID-19 confirmed cases obtained > 15 days after symptom onset. Specificity was determined by testing sera from 94 healthy controls. Cross-reactivity was evaluated with sera from 96 individuals with previous dengue or zika virus-confirmed infections, with 44 sera from individuals with confirmed infections to other respiratory viruses or with bacterial and fungal infections that cause pneumonia and with 40 sera negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein by commercial ELISA kits. Results: The majority of subjects were male and ≥ 60 years old. Assay sensitivity was 90.3 % (95 % confidence interval 84.1 %-94.2 %) and specificity was 97.9 % (92.6 %-99.4 %). There was no cross-reactivity with sera from individuals diagnosed with dengue, zika virus, influenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, seasonal coronavirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus (S. aureus and coagulase-negative), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The level of concordance of our test with results from commercial ELISA kits was 100 %. Conclusion: The nucleoprotein-based ELISA was specific for detection of IgG anti-nucleoprotein antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. It utilizes a frequently employed low expense assay protocol and is easier to perform than other currently available commercial SARS-CoV2 antibody detection tests."
