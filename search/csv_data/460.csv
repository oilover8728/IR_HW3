4590,"""This choice does not just affect me."" Attitudes of pregnant women toward COVID-19 vaccines: a mixed-methods study.","Public health experts agree that pregnant women who fall into priority groups may be offered a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. However, little is known about attitudes of pregnant women toward COVID-19 vaccination. We surveyed 300 pregnant women during the roll out of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Ireland. Women rated likelihood of receipt of a vaccine during pregnancy, on a 1-10 scale (1 = very unlikely, 10 = very likely). One hundred and thirteen (38%) women responded with a score of ≥8, while a similar proportion (36%) selected a score of ≤2. Safety of their unborn infant was the primary driver of decision making among survey participants, but specific safety concerns differed according to likely acceptance of a vaccine. Communication about COVID-19 vaccines to pregnant women must explicitly address safety. Pregnant women and their health-care providers should be supported with accessible interpretations of data so that they can make the best choice for their individual risk profile."
4591,"Ct threshold values, a proxy for viral load in community SARS-CoV-2 cases, demonstrate wide variation across populations and over time.","Background: Information on SARS-CoV-2 in representative community surveillance is limited, particularly cycle threshold (Ct) values (a proxy for viral load). Methods: We included all positive nose and throat swabs 26 April 2020 to 13 March 2021 from the UK's national COVID-19 Infection Survey, tested by RT-PCR for the N, S, and ORF1ab genes. We investigated predictors of median Ct value using quantile regression. Results: Of 3,312,159 nose and throat swabs, 27,902 (0.83%) were RT-PCR-positive, 10,317 (37%), 11,012 (40%), and 6550 (23%) for 3, 2, or 1 of the N, S, and ORF1ab genes, respectively, with median Ct = 29.2 (~215 copies/ml; IQR Ct = 21.9-32.8, 14-56,400 copies/ml). Independent predictors of lower Cts (i.e. higher viral load) included self-reported symptoms and more genes detected, with at most small effects of sex, ethnicity, and age. Single-gene positives almost invariably had Ct > 30, but Cts varied widely in triple-gene positives, including without symptoms. Population-level Cts changed over time, with declining Ct preceding increasing SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Of 6189 participants with IgG S-antibody tests post-first RT-PCR-positive, 4808 (78%) were ever antibody-positive; Cts were significantly higher in those remaining antibody negative. Conclusions: Marked variation in community SARS-CoV-2 Ct values suggests that they could be a useful epidemiological early-warning indicator.

4594,Synthetic modified messenger RNA for therapeutic applications.,"Synthetic modified messenger RNA (mRNA) has manifested great potentials for therapeutic applications such as vaccines and gene therapies, with the recent mRNA vaccines for global pandemic COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) attracting the tremendous attention. The chemical modifications and delivery vehicles of synthetic mRNAs are the two key factors for their in vivo therapeutic applications. Chemical modifications like nucleoside methylation endow the synthetic mRNAs with high stability and reduced stimulation of innate immunity. The development of scalable production of synthetic mRNA and efficient mRNA formulation and delivery strategies in recent years have remarkably advanced the field. It is worth noticing that we had limited knowledge on the roles of mRNA modifications in the past. However, the last decade has witnessed not only new discoveries of several naturally occurring mRNA modifications but also substantial advances in understanding their roles on regulating gene expression. It is highly necessary to reconsider the therapeutic system made by synthetic modified mRNAs and delivery vectors. In this review, we will mainly discuss the roles of various chemical modifications on synthetic mRNAs, briefly summarize the progresses of mRNA delivery strategies, and highlight some latest mRNA therapeutics applications including infectious disease vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, mRNA-based genetic reprogramming and protein replacement, mRNA-based gene editing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The development of synthetic mRNA drug holds great promise but lies behind small molecule and protein drugs largely due to the challenging issues regarding its stability, immunogenicity and potency. In the last 15 years, these issues have beensubstantially addressed by synthesizing chemically modified mRNA and developing powerful delivery systems; the mRNA therapeutics has entered an exciting new era begun with the approved mRNA vaccines for the COVID-19 infection disease. Here, we provide recent progresses in understanding the biological roles of various RNA chemical modifications, in developing mRNA delivery systems, and in advancing the emerging mRNA-based therapeutic applications, with the purpose to inspire the community to spawn new ideas for curing diseases."

4599,The potential health and economic value of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alongside physical distancing in the UK: a transmission model-based future scenario analysis and economic evaluation.,"Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK first adopted physical distancing measures in March, 2020. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 became available in December, 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing in the UK to gain insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era. Methods: We used an age-structured dynamic transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of UK mass immunisation programmes over 10 years. We compared vaccinating 75% of individuals aged 15 years or older (and annually revaccinating 50% of individuals aged 15-64 years and 75% of individuals aged 65 years or older) to no vaccination. We assumed either 50% vaccine efficacy against disease and 45-week protection (worst-case scenario) or 95% vaccine efficacy against infection and 3-year protection (best-case scenario). Natural immunity was assumed to wane within 45 weeks. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing on vaccination by assuming either an initial lockdown followed by voluntary physical distancing, or an initial lockdown followed by increased physical distancing mandated above a certain threshold of incident daily infections. We considered benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs, both to the health-care payer and the national economy. We discounted future costs and QALYs at 3·5% annually and assumed a monetary value per QALY of £20 000 and a conservative long-run cost per vaccine dose of £15. We explored and varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses. We expressed the health and economic benefits of each scenario with the net monetary value: QALYs × (monetary value per QALY) - costs. Findings: Without the initial lockdown, vaccination, and increased physical distancing, we estimated 148·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 48·5-198·8) COVID-19 cases and 3·1 million (0·84-4·5) deaths would occur in the UK over 10 years. In the best-case scenario, vaccination minimises community transmission without future periods of increased physical distancing, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic with biannual epidemics in the worst-case scenario. Ongoing transmission is also expected in intermediate scenarios with vaccine efficacy similar to published clinical trial data. From a health-care perspective, introducing vaccination leads to incremental net monetary values ranging from £12·0 billion to £334·7 billion in the best-case scenario and from -£1·1 billion to £56·9 billion in the worst-case scenario. Incremental net monetary values of increased physical distancing might be negative from a societal perspective if national economy losses are persistent and large. Interpretation: Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Smaller outbreaks could continue even with vaccines, but population-wide implementation of increased physical distancing might no longer be justifiable. Our study provides early insights about possible future post-vaccination scenarios from an economic and epidemiological perspective.
