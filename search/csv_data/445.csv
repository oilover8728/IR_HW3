4440,A guide to laboratory diagnosis of Corona Virus Disease-19 for the gastroenterologists.,"The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a global pandemic, is having a significant impact on healthcare, especially the clinical microbiology laboratories all around the world. There are many reports which suggest that the disease can present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite, which the gastroenterologists may have to deal with. Hence, knowledge about the diagnosis of COVID-19 is important to gastroenterologists as well. The current review therefore covers the challenges faced while choosing appropriate sample collection, transport, and tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The right sample at the right time from the right anatomical site with the proper precautions is crucial in prompt and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. The tests can be divided into direct, indirect, and complementary tests. In the direct test, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are the molecular tests of choice for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Other direct tests include GeneXpert and TrueNAT. In indirect testing, antigen-antibody-based techniques are recommended for surveillance for the disease, which may help to formulate the control measures. Finally, the additional tests help in assessing the disease severity and evaluating the prognosis. All the above tests are important not only for diagnosis but also for management strategy and prognosis."
4441,"Epidemiologically Linked COVID-19 Outbreaks at a Youth Camp and Men's Conference - Illinois, June-July 2021.","On June 30, 2021, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) contacted CDC concerning COVID-19 outbreaks at two events sponsored by the same organization: a 5-day overnight church camp for persons aged 14-18 years and a 2-day men's conference. Neither COVID-19 vaccination nor COVID-19 testing was required before either event. As of August 13, a total of 180 confirmed and probable cases had been identified among attendees at the two events and their close contacts. Among the 122 cases associated with the camp or the conference (primary cases), 18 were in persons who were fully vaccinated, with 38 close contacts. Eight of these 38 close contacts subsequently became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (secondary cases); among the eight close contacts with secondary cases, one half (four) were fully vaccinated. Among the 180 total persons with outbreak-associated cases, five (2.8%) were hospitalized; no deaths occurred. None of the vaccinated persons with cases were hospitalized. Approximately 1,000 persons across at least four states were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through attendance at these events or through close contact with a person who had a primary case. This investigation underscores the impact of secondary SARS-CoV-2 transmission during large events, such as camps and conferences, when COVID-19 prevention strategies are not implemented. In Los Angeles County, California, during July 2021, when the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant was predominant, unvaccinated residents were five times more likely to be infected and 29 times more likely to be hospitalized from infection than were vaccinated residents (1). Implementation of multiple prevention strategies, including vaccination and nonpharmaceutical interventions such as masking, physical distancing, and screening testing, are critical to preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and serious complications from COVID-19."
4442,Heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and mRNA-1273 Vaccination.,
4443,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students.,"Background: Medical students are among the group of frontline healthcare providers likely to be exposed to COVID-19 patients. It is important to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates in this group as soon as a vaccine is available. As future healthcare providers, they will be entrusted with providing vaccine recommendations and counseling vaccine-hesitant patients. Methods: This project used self-report to assess vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among medical students towards the novel COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Nearly all participants had positive attitudes towards vaccines and agreed they would likely be exposed to COVID-19; however, only 53% indicated they would participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and 23% were unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine immediately upon FDA approval. Students willing to immediately take the vaccine were more likely to trust public health experts, have fewer concerns about side effects and agree with vaccine mandates (P < 0.05). Concern for serious side effects was independently predictive of lower odds of intent to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial (AOR = 0.41, P = 0.01). Conclusion: This is the first study to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US medical students and highlights the need for an educational curriculum about the safety and effectiveness to promote uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine."
4444,Mini Review Immunological Consequences of Immunization With COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines: Preliminary Results.,"Background: BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are the two recently approved mRNA-based vaccines against COVID-19 which has shown excellent safety and efficacy. Preliminary data about specific and neutralizing antibodies is available covering the first 100 days after vaccination. Methods: We reviewed all the publications regarding the immunologic consequences of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccination. A summary of specific antibodies concentration and neutralizing antibodies titers elicited by each vaccine is provided. Results: BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 displayed a reassuring safety and efficacy profile, with the latter above 94%. They can elicit specific antibodies titers and neutralizing antibodies concentrations that are far superior from those observed among COVID-19 human convalescent serum, across a wide span of age, for at least 100 days after vaccination. Moreover, the vaccine-induced T cellular response is oriented toward a TH1 response and no evidence of vaccine-enhanced disease have been reported. Discussion: BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 can elicit specific antibodies titers and neutralizing antibodies concentrations above those observed among COVID-19 human convalescent serum in the first 100 days after vaccination. Data about vaccine efficacy in those with previous COVID-19 or immunocompromised is still limited."

4446,An approach to lifting self-isolation for health care workers with prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.,"Purpose: According to the European Public Health Authority guidance for ending isolation in the context of COVID-19, a convalescent healthcare worker (HCW) can end their isolation at home and resume work upon clinical improvement and two negative RT-PCR tests from respiratory specimens obtained at 24-h intervals at least 8 days after the onset of symptoms. However, convalescent HCWs may shed SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA for prolonged periods. Methods: 40 healthy HCWs off work because of ongoing positive RT-PCR results in combined nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs following SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited to participate in this study. These HCWs had been in self-isolation because of a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NP and OP swabs as well as a blood sample were collected from each participant. RT-PCR and virus isolation was performed with each swab sample and serum neutralization test as well as two different ELISA tests were performed on all serum samples. Results: No viable virions could be detected in any of 29 nasopharyngeal and 29 oropharyngeal swabs taken from 15 long-time carriers. We found SARSCoV- 2 RNA in 14/29 nasopharyngeal and 10/29 oropharyngeal swabs obtained from screening 15 HCWs with previous COVID-19 up to 55 days after symptom onset. Six (40%) of the 15 initially positive HCWs converted to negative and later reverted to positive again according to their medical records. All but one HCW, a healthy volunteer banned from work, showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in concomitantly taken blood samples. Late threshold cycle (Ct) values in RT-PCR [mean 37.4; median 37.3; range 30.8-41.7] and the lack of virus growth in cell culture indicate that despite the positive PCR results no infectivity remained. Conclusion: We recommend lifting isolation if the RT-PCR Ct-value of a naso- or oropharyngeal swab sample is over 30. Positive results obtained from genes targeted with Ct-values > 30 correspond to non-viable/noninfectious particles that are still detected by RT-PCR. In case of Ct-values lower than 30, a blood sample from the patient should be tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. If positive, non-infectiousness can also be assumed."
4447,"COVID-19 Infections Among Healthcare Personnel in the United States Veterans Health Administration, March to August, 2020.","Objective: We investigated COVID-19 infection and death among healthcare personnel (HCP) in the United States Veterans Health Administration. Methods: HCP with positive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests between March 1 and August 31, 2020 were included. Risk ratios were calculated for sex, age, race/ethnicity, Veteran status, occupation category, facility of employment by inpatient COVID-19 test percent positivity and death. Results: Five thousand nine hundred twenty five HCP were COVID-19-infected out of 131,606 tested (4.5% positivity). Highest risk for COVID-19 infection included: HCP working in hospitals with more than 15% inpatient COVID-19 test positivity, nursing staff, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic or Latino HCP and HCP who were Veterans. Among 18 HCP who died after COVID-19 infection, male sex, age more than or equal to 65 years, and Veteran status were significant risk factors. Conclusions: Robust national surveillance testing methods are needed to accurately monitor HCP COVID-19 infections and deaths to improve HCP safety."
4448,Inactivated rabies virus vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prevents disease in a Syrian hamster model.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. Although human disease is often asymptomatic, some develop severe illnesses such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. There is an urgent need for a vaccine to prevent its rapid spread as asymptomatic infections accounting for up to 40% of transmission events. Here we further evaluated an inactivated rabies vectored SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine CORAVAX in a Syrian hamster model. CORAVAX adjuvanted with MPLA-AddaVax, a TRL4 agonist, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and generated a strong Th1-biased immune response. Vaccinated hamsters were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates three days after challenge with SARS-CoV-2. CORAVAX also prevented lung disease, as indicated by the significant reduction in lung pathology. This study highlights CORAVAX as a safe, immunogenic, and efficacious vaccine that warrants further assessment in human trials."
4449,Use of Vinegar and Water to Identify COVID-19 Cases During a Workplace Entrance Screening Protocol.,"Objective: To evaluate an empirical olfactory test to identify COVID-19 cases during a workplace entrance screening. Method: An active screening for olfactory dysfunction using water and vinegar was conducted in April to June 2020 among 4120 meat packing workers in Latin America. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the active olfactory screening examination were 41.2% and 85.3%, respectively, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests as a gold standard. 10.6% of employees who tested positive for COVID-19 had an olfactory dysfunction as their only symptom. These individuals would not have been identified with standard workplace screening measures including temperature screening. Conclusion: Active screening for olfactory dysfunction may serve as a valuable tool to both identify potential COVID-19 infections and exclude those who do not have infection and should be a part of parallel algorithm combined with standard workplace entrance screening procedures."
