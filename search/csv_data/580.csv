5790,Longitudinal assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversionamong front-line healthcare workers during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic at a tertiary-care hospital in Chile.,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Cross-sectional studies have provided variable rates of seroprevalence in HCWs. Longitudinal assessments of the serological response to Covid-19 among HCWs are crucial to understanding the risk of infection and changes in antibody titers over time. We aimed to investigate seroprevalence and risk factors associated with seroconversion in a prospective cohort of HCWs during the peak of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study among 446 front-line HCWsin a tertiary-care hospital in Chile from April to July 2020. IgG was determined monthly using two different ELISAs in serum samples of HCWs, during the three-month period. In each visit, demographic data, symptoms, risk factors, and exposure risks were also assessed. Results: The overall seroprevalence at the end of the study period was 24% (95% CI20.2-28.3), with 43% of seropositive HCWs reporting no prior symptoms. Seroconversion rates significantly differed over the study period, from 2.1% to as high as 8.8% at the peak of the epidemic. There were no statistically significant differences observed between HCWs in direct clinical care of patients with Covid-19 and those working in low risk areas. Antibody titers appeared to wane over time. Conclusions: HCWs were severely affected with a high rate of seroconversion that appeared to mirror the local epidemiological situation. A significant amount of participants underwent an asymptomatic infection, highlighting the need for improved surveillance policies. Antibody titers appear to wane over time; further studies to understand this finding's impact on the risk of reinfection are warranted."

5792,Healthcare Staff Perceptions Following Inoculation with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine at University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust.,"Background:&nbsp;COVID-19 vaccination programmes offer hope for a potential end to the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We present perceptions following from a cohort of healthcare staff at the UK NHS hospital, which first initiated the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (""Pfizer"") vaccination program. Methods: A paper-based survey regarding perceptions on the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was distributed to all healthcare workers at the University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust following receipt of the first vaccine dose. Results: 535 healthcare workers completed the survey, with a 40.9% response rate. Staff felt privileged to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Staff reported that they had minimised contact with patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Reported changes to activity following vaccination both at work and outside work were guarded. Statistically significant differences were noted between information sources used by staff groups and between groups of different ethnic backgrounds to inform decisions to receive vaccination. Conclusions: NHS staff felt privileged to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and felt that their actions would promote uptake in the wider population. Concerns regarding risks and side effects existed, but were minimal. This research can be used to help inform strategies driving wider vaccine uptake amongst healthcare staff and the public."
5793,"Lessons learned from the investigation of a COVID-19 cluster in Creil, France: effectiveness of targeting symptomatic cases and conducting contact tracing around them.","Background: This study presents the methods and results of the investigation into a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a professional community. Due to the limited testing capacity available in France at the time, we elaborated a testing strategy according to pre-test probability. Methods: The investigation design combined active case finding and contact tracing around each confirmed case with testing of at-risk contact persons who had any evocative symptoms (n = 88). One month later, we performed serology testing to test and screen symptomatic and asymptomatic cases again (n = 79). Results: Twenty-four patients were confirmed (14 with RT-PCR and 10 with serology). The attack rate was 29% (24/83). Median age was 40 (24 to 59), and the sex ratio was 15/12. Only three cases were asymptomatic (= no symptoms at all, 13%, 95% CI, 3-32). Nineteen symptomatic cases (79%, 95% CI, 63-95) presented a respiratory infection, two of which were severe. All the RT-PCR confirmed cases acquired protective antibodies. Median incubation was 4 days (from 1 to 13 days), and the median serial interval was 3 days (0 to 15). We identified pre-symptomatic transmission in 40% of this cluster, but no transmission from asymptomatic to symptomatic cases. Conclusion: We report the effective use of targeted testing according to pre-test probability, specifically prioritizing symptomatic COVID-19 diagnosis and contact tracing. The asymptomatic rate raises questions about the real role of asymptomatic infected people in transmission. Conversely, pre-symptomatic contamination occurred frequently in this cluster, highlighting the need to identify, test, and quarantine asymptomatic at-risk contact persons (= contact tracing). The local lockdown imposed helped reduce transmission during the investigation period."
5794,Latent class analysis of COVID-19 symptoms in Brazil: results of the PNAD-COVID19 survey.,"The lack of mass testing for COVID-19 diagnosis creates the need to determine the magnitude of the disease based on its clinical symptoms. The study aimed to analyze the profile of COVID-19 symptoms and related aspects in Brazil. The author analyzed the sample of participants from the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD-COVID19) conducted in May 2020. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed with sociodemographic covariables and 11 symptoms reported by 346,181 individuals. Rao-Scott test and standardized residual analysis were used to measure the association with the pattern of health services use. Spatial scan analysis was performed to identify areas at risk of COVID-19 cases. LCA showed six classes of symptoms based on the pattern of answers by participants: (1) all the symptoms; (2) high prevalence of symptoms; (3) predominance of fever; (4) predominance of cough/sore throat; (5) mild symptoms with predominance of headache; and (6) absence of symptoms. Female sex, brown skin color, the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, and all three older age brackets showed stronger association with the class with all the symptoms (class 1). Most use of health services was also by this group of individuals, but with different profiles of use. Spatial analysis showed juxtaposition of this class with areas at greater risk of COVID-19. These finding underline the importance of investigating symptoms for the epidemiological identification of possible cases in a scenario with low population testing rates."

5798,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of people living with HIV hospitalized with COVID-19: a nationwide experience.,"In this prospective, multicentric, observational study, we describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of people living with HIV (PLHIV) requiring hospitalization due to COVID-19 in Chile and compare them with Chilean general population admitted with SARS-CoV-2. Consecutive PLHIV admitted with COVID-19 in 23 hospitals, between 16 April and 23 June 2020, were included. Data of a temporally matched-hospitalized general population were used to compare demography, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms, and major outcomes. In total, 36 PLHIV subjects were enrolled; 92% were male and mean age was 44 years. Most patients (83%) were on antiretroviral therapy; mean CD4 count was 557 cells/mm3. Suppressed HIV viremia was found in 68% and 56% had, at least, one comorbidity. Severe COVID-19 occurred in 44.4%, intensive care was required in 22.2%, and five patients died (13.9%). No differences were seen between recovered and deceased patients in CD4 count, HIV viral load, or time since HIV diagnosis. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease were associated with a higher risk of death (p = 0.02 and 0.006, respectively). Compared with general population, the HIV cohort had significantly more men (OR 0.15; IC 95% 0.07-0.31) and younger age (OR 8.68; IC 95% 2.66-28.31). In PLHIV, we found more intensive care unit admission (OR 2.31; IC 95% 1.05-5.07) but no differences in the need for mechanical ventilation or death. In this cohort of PLHIV hospitalized with COVID-19, hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities, but not current HIV viro-immunologic status, were the most important risk factors for mortality. No differences were found between PLHIV and general population in the need for mechanical ventilation and death."
