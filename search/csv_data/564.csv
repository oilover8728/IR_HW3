5630,Experience of the use of hydroxychloroquine on patients with COVID-19: A perspective on viral load and cytokine kinetics.,"Until now, there are no approved treatment against COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was hypothesized to be active against SARS-CoV2 via antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect; however, HCQ for COVID-19 in clinical use remained debating. In this preliminary report, we presented six patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. They were treated with HCQ for 14 days from the day of COVID-19 diagnosis. Serial viral load from respiratory specimens were performed every other day. Cytokine profile was checked before HCQ initiation and on the 14th day of HCQ treatment. All patients receiving HCQ completed 14-day course without complication. Among the six patients, the mean duration from symptom onset to last detectable viral load was 34 ± 12 days, which was similar to those without specific treatment in previous reports. Low level of interferon-gamma was noted in all patients of different stage of infection and three patients had elevation of IL-17 level. Prolonged virus shedding is still observed regardless HCQ. The impact of HCQ on cytokine kinetics remained unclear; however, IL-17 could be an inflammatory marker for disease status monitor and a potential therapeutic target."
5631,A single dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 elicits Fc-mediated antibody effector functions and T cell responses.,"While the standard regimen of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 includes two doses administered 3 weeks apart, some public health authorities are spacing these doses, raising concerns about efficacy. However, data indicate that a single dose can be up to 90% effective starting 14 days post-administration. To assess the mechanisms contributing to protection, we analyzed humoral and T cell responses three weeks after a single BNT162b2 dose. We observed weak neutralizing activity elicited in SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals but strong anti-receptor binding domain and spike antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions and cellular CD4+ T cell responses. In previously infected individuals, a single dose boosted all humoral and T cell responses, with strong correlations between T helper and antibody immunity. Our results highlight the potential role of Fc-mediated effector functions and T cell responses in vaccine efficacy. They also provide support for spacing doses to vaccinate more individuals in conditions of vaccine scarcity."
5632,"[COVID-19 - BLOOD GROUPS, ANTIBODIES AND CONVALESCENT PLASMA].","Israel is currently struggling with the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS CoV-2. Transmission is increasing, with higher morbidity and mortality among populations at risk. Over-representation of blood type A was reported in COVID-19 patients with increased respiratory failure, while blood type O seems to have a protective effect. This may be caused by interference of anti-A antibodies in viral binding to the ACE receptor, different neutralization antibodies potency or variations in the stability of von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers in different blood types. Since transfusion of convalescent COVID19 Plasma (CCP) is an accepted therapeutic modality, the Ministry of Health initiated a national project whereby CCP is collected by Magen David Adom (MDA) Blood Services using apheresis procedures and transfusions are approved by an experts committee, as part of the clinical trial or as compassionate treatment. Preliminary analysis of 49/170 patients treated so far shows improvement in 49%, with important relations with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies level in the transfused plasma. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 83% of 1100 CCP donors, but a 13% decrease in antibodies level was detected in repeat donations. Blood type A was more predominant among CCP donors, when compared to MDA blood donors' data. A transfusion of CCP is a feasible and relatively safe therapeutic modality, mainly for patients with moderate COVID 19. CCP also serves as a source for the production of hyperimmune globulin for the treatment of COVID 19 and for passive immunization for populations at risk."
5633,"Ecological Analysis of the Decline in Incidence Rates of COVID-19 Among Nursing Home Residents Associated with Vaccination, United States, December 2020-January 2021.","Objective: To evaluate if facility-level vaccination after an initial vaccination clinic was independently associated with COVID-19 incidence adjusted for other factors in January 2021 among nursing home residents. Design: Ecological analysis of data from the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and from the CDC's Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program. Setting and participants: CMS-certified nursing homes participating in both NHSN and the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program. Methods: A multivariable, random intercepts, negative binomial model was applied to contrast COVID-19 incidence rates among residents living in facilities with an initial vaccination clinic during the week ending January 3, 2021 (n = 2843), vs those living in facilities with no vaccination clinic reported up to and including the week ending January 10, 2021 (n = 3216). Model covariates included bed size, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing, staff with COVID-19, cumulative COVID-19 among residents, residents admitted with COVID-19, community county incidence, and county social vulnerability index (SVI). Results: In December 2020 and January 2021, incidence of COVID-19 among nursing home residents declined to the lowest point since reporting began in May, diverged from the pattern in community cases, and began dropping before vaccination occurred. Comparing week 3 following an initial vaccination clinic vs week 2, the adjusted reduction in COVID-19 rate in vaccinated facilities was 27% greater than the reduction in facilities where vaccination clinics had not yet occurred (95% confidence interval: 14%-38%, P < .05). Conclusions and implications: Vaccination of residents contributed to the decline in COVID-19 incidence in nursing homes; however, other factors also contributed. The decline in COVID-19 was evident prior to widespread vaccination, highlighting the benefit of a multifaced approach to prevention including continued use of recommended screening, testing, and infection prevention practices as well as vaccination to keep residents in nursing homes safe."
5634,NVX-CoV2373 vaccine protects cynomolgus macaque upper and lower airways against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.,"There is an urgent need for a safe and protective vaccine to control the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent COVID-19. Here, we report the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) produced from the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein stabilized in the prefusion conformation. Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) immunized with NVX-CoV2373 and the saponin-based Matrix-M™ adjuvant induced anti-S antibody that was neutralizing and blocked binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. Following intranasal and intratracheal challenge with SARS-CoV-2, immunized macaques were protected against upper and lower infection and pulmonary disease. These results support ongoing phase 1/2 clinical studies of the safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2327 vaccine (NCT04368988)."
5635,Subjective Feelings of Polish Doctors after Receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused enormous confusion around the world in our daily existence. The security measures taken, such as physical distance, wearing a mask, quarantine or closing shopping malls, and even isolating large groups of the population, did not contribute to the complete overcoming of the problem. Information on the positive results of research into the COVID-19 vaccine and, finally, its administration offered hope that the pandemic would be overcome. The undertaken problem of research concerning the subjective analysis of the feelings of doctors in Poland after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine shows an important area of the medical world, which is directly responsible for their own health and the patients entrusted to them. In addition, 149 people participated in the study (8-13 February 2021), including 57% of women and 43% of men. The minimum and maximum age of the respondents are 26 and 69 years old. Furthermore, 85% of respondents took two doses of the vaccine and 15% took one. The authorial questionnaire was completed by the participants in the study online in February 2021. The results obtained indicate that the COVID-19 vaccine generates hope for stopping the pandemic. In addition, 96% of research participants think so. Doctors in middle and mature age are the most optimistic, while the youngest ones are less optimistic. In addition, 57% of respondents do not worry about side effects after taking the vaccine. Fear at the time of vaccination was experienced by over 9% of doctors. The most frequently reported post-vaccination reactions are injection site pain, fatigue and headache. Increased temperature occurred in older female respondents. From a psychosocial perspective, men are more likely to fear being infected personally with the virus, and women are more likely to be infected with their loved ones. The presented subjective assessment presents the physicians' view captured at the moment in terms of existential and emotional. The presented feelings of the research participants reflect their personal satisfaction, responsibility for their own health, care for their relatives and patients."
5636,Potential interventions for novel coronavirus in China: A systematic review.,"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable."

We developed a multiplex rRT-PCR methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Methods: Three genes were used for multiplex rRT-PCR: the Sarbecovirus specific E gene, the SARS-CoV-2 specific N gene, and the human ABL1 gene as an internal control. Results: Good correlation of Cq values was observed between the simplex and multiplex rRT-PCR methodologies. Low copies (<25 copies/reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by the novel multiplex rRT-PCR method. Conclusion: The proposed multiplex rRT-PCR methodology will enable highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, reducing reagent use and cost, and time required by clinical laboratory technicians."
