9111,COVID-19 multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in adults: a not to be missed diagnosis.,"We report COVID-19 multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in an adult patient with an atypical presentation (mild abdominal pain) and a negative (repeated) reverse transcriptase-PCR, in the absence of lung involvement on lung ultrasound. In this case, focused cardiac ultrasound revealed signs of myopericarditis and enabled us to focus on the problem that was putting our patient in a perilous situation, with a quick, non-time-consuming and easy-to-access technique. Serology test was performed and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed more than a week after admission to the coronary unit. As the patient had a general good appearance, the potential implications of missing this diagnosis could have been fatal."

9113,Transmission of infection from non-isolated patients with COVID-19 to healthcare workers.,"Insufficiently protected healthcare workers (HCWs), defined as high-risk contacts of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are routinely quarantined. This study evaluated the transmission of infection from a symptomatic patient with COVID-19 to 60 HCWs exposed at ≤2 m for ≥15 min or during aerosol-generating procedures. Following ≥106 unique high-risk contacts, none of the HCWs tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 RNA or developed antibodies. The HCWs reported adherence to basic infection control procedures. These results are in accordance with other reports, and should reassure HCWs and further stimulate broader evaluation of the foundation for the current practice of home quarantining non-symptomatic HCWs."
9114,South Korea's responses to stop the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Background: South Korea's aggressive responses to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have greatly slowed the epidemic without regional lockdowns. Methods: The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's daily briefings were thoroughly reviewed. Information about hospital countermeasures and government coordination was collected via telephone interviews with 4 infection control team leaders, 1 emergency department nurse, and 1 infectious disease physician in Korea. Results: After the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, the government and hospitals prepared for the inevitable outbreak of emerging infectious diseases by reforming the epidemic preparedness system. As a result, COVID-19 diagnostic test kits were quickly developed, enabling extensive early detection of potential cases. Other key steps were tracking cases, finding exposed individuals, coordinating case assignments with health care facilities, and selective clinic screenings for visitors' entering hospitals with mandatory mask wearing. Consequently, after overcoming the initial peak of the outbreak, which was related to a religious group, Korea has been able to maintain daily new cases at around 100 and to less than 50 daily cases in the second week of April. Conclusions: To counter the COVID-19 pandemic, which may persist, long-term, sustained response strategies must be prepared along with coordination between government and health systems."
9115,Animal models for SARS-CoV-2.,"Since its first detection in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread worldwide, resulting in over 79.2 million documented cases in one year. Lack of pre-existing immunity against this newly emerging virus has pushed the urgent development of anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines to reduce the spread of the virus and alleviate disease. Appropriate animal models recapitulating the pathogenesis of and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans have and will continue to accelerate this development process. Several animal models including mice, hamsters, ferrets, and non-human primates have been evaluated and actively applied in preclinical studies. However, since each animal model has unique features, it is necessary to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of each according to the goals of the study. Here, we summarize the key features, strengths and weaknesses of animal models for SARS-CoV-2, focusing on their application in anti-viral therapeutic and vaccine development."
9116,Comparative insight into the genomic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and identification of mutations associated with the origin of infection and diversity.,"The analyses of 2325 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes revealed 107, 162, and 65 nucleotide substitutions in the coding region of SARS-CoV-2 from the three continents America, Europe, and Asia, respectively. Of these nucleotide substitutions 58, 94, and 37 were nonsynonymous types mostly present in the Nsp2, Nsp3, Spike, and ORF9. A continent-specific phylogram analyses clustered the SARS-CoV-2 in the different group based on the frequency of nucleotide substitutions. Detailed analyses about the continent-specific amino acid changes and their effectiveness by SNAP2 software was investigated. We found 11 common nonsynonymous mutations; among them, two novel effective mutations were identified in ORF9 (S194L and S202N). Intriguingly, ORF9 encodes nucleocapsid phosphoprotein possessing many effective mutations across continents and could be a potential candidate after the spike protein for studying the role of mutation in viral assembly and pathogenesis. Among the two forms of certain frequent mutation, one form is more prevalent in Europe continents (Nsp12:L314, Nsp13:P504, Nsp13:Y541, Spike:G614, and ORF8:L84) while other forms are more prevalent in American (Nsp12:P314, Nsp13:L504, Nsp13:C541, Spike:D614, and ORF8:L84) and Asian continents (Spike:D614), indicating the spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We identified highly conserved 38 regions and among these regions, 11 siRNAs were predicted on stringent criteria that can be used to suppress the expression of viral genes and the corresponding reduction of human viral infections. The present investigation provides information on different mutations and will pave the way for differentiating strains based on virulence and their use in the development of better antiviral therapy."
9117,E484K as an innovative phylogenetic event for viral evolution: Genomic analysis of the E484K spike mutation in SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Brazil.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected millions of people since its beginning in 2019. The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public health policies, research and disease management. Since the second semester of 2020, the mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory, composing different lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from Brazilian samples in 2020. From October 2020, more than 40% of the sequenced genomes present the E484K mutation, which was identified in three different lineages (P.1, P.2 and B.1.1.33 - posteriorly renamed as N.9) in four Brazilian regions. We also evaluated the presence of E484K associated mutations and identified selective pressures acting on the spike protein, leading us to some insights about adaptive and purifying selection driving the virus evolution."
9118,"SARS-CoV-2: Origin, Evolution, and Targeting Inhibition.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak in Wuhan city, China and quickly spread worldwide. Currently, there are no specific drugs or antibodies that claim to cure severe acute respiratory diseases. For SARS-CoV-2, the spike (S) protein recognizes and binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, allowing viral RNA to enter the host cell. The main protease (Mpro) is involved in the proteolytic process for mature non-structural proteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is responsible for the viral genome replication and transcription processes. Owing to the pivotal physiological roles in viral invasion and replication, S protein, Mpro, RdRp are regarded as the main therapeutic targets for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we carried out an evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other mammal-infecting coronaviruses that have sprung up in the past few decades and described the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. We displayed the structural details of S protein, Mpro, and RdRp, as well as their complex structures with different chemical inhibitors or antibodies. Structural comparisons showed that some neutralizing antibodies and small molecule inhibitors could inhibit S protein, Mpro, or RdRp. Moreover, we analyzed the structural differences between SARS-CoV-2 ancestral S protein and D614G mutant, which led to a second wave of infection during the recent pandemic. In this context, we outline the methods that might potentially help cure COVID-19 and provide a summary of effective chemical molecules and neutralizing antibodies."
