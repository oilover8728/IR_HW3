1471,Microfluidic devices for detection of RNA viruses.,"There is a long way to go before the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak comes under control. qRT-PCR is currently used for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Covid-19, but it is expensive, time-consuming, and not as sensitive as it should be. Finding a rapid, easy-to-use, and cheap diagnostic method is necessary to help control the current outbreak. Microfluidic systems provide a platform for many diagnostic tests, including RT-PCR, RT-LAMP, nested-PCR, nucleic acid hybridization, ELISA, fluorescence-Based Assays, rolling circle amplification, aptamers, sample preparation multiplexer (SPM), Porous Silicon Nanowire Forest, silica sol-gel coating/bonding, and CRISPR. They promise faster, cheaper, and easy-to-use methods with higher sensitivity, so microfluidic devices have a high potential to be an alternative method for the detection of viral RNA. These devices have previously been used to detect RNA viruses such as H1N1, Zika, HAV, HIV, and norovirus, with acceptable results. This paper provides an overview of microfluidic systems as diagnostic methods for RNA viruses with a focus on SARS-CoV-2."

1473,Informed sequential pooling approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The alarming spread of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires several measures to reduce the risk of contagion. Every successful strategy in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on timely diagnosis, which should include testing of asymptomatic carriers. Consequently, increasing the throughput for clinical laboratories for the purposes of conducting large-scale diagnostic testing is urgently needed. Here we support the hypothesis that standard diagnostic protocol for SARS-CoV-2 virus could be conveniently applied to pooled samples obtained from different subjects. We suggest that a two-step sequential pooling procedure could identify positive subjects, ensuring at the same time significant benefits of cost and time. The simulation data presented herein were used to assess the efficiency, in terms of number of required tests, both for random assignment of the subjects to the pools and for situations in which epidemiological and clinical data are used to create ""informed"" pools. Different scenarios were simulated to measure the effect of different pool sizes and different values for virus frequency. Our results allow for a customization of the pooling strategy according to the specific characteristics of the cohort being tested."
1474,Evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in atmospheric air and surfaces of a dedicated COVID hospital.,"The present study was conducted from July 1, 2020 to September 25, 2020 in a dedicated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospital in Delhi, India to provide evidence for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in atmospheric air and surfaces of the hospital wards. Swabs from hospital surfaces (patient's bed, ward floor, and nursing stations area) and suspended particulate matter in ambient air were collected by a portable air sampler from the medicine ward, intensive care unit, and emergency ward admitting COVID-19 patients. By performing reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for E-gene and RdRp gene, SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected from hospital surfaces and particulate matters from the ambient air of various wards collected at 1 and 3-m distance from active COVID-19 patients. The presence of the virus in the air beyond a 1-m distance from the patients and surfaces of the hospital indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to be transmitted by airborne and surface routes from COVID-19 patients to health-care workers working in COVID-19 dedicated hospital. This warrants that precautions against airborne and surface transmission of COVID-19 in the community should be taken when markets, industries, educational institutions, and so on, reopen for normal activities."

1477,Sample pooling: burden or solution?,"Background: Pool-testing strategies combine samples from multiple people and test them as a group. A pool-testing approach may shorten the screening time and increase the test rate during times of limited test availability and inadequate reporting speed. Pool testing has been effectively used for a wide variety of infectious disease screening settings. Historically, it originated from serological testing in syphilis. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pool testing is considered across the globe to inform opening strategies and to monitor infection rates after the implementation of interventions. Aims: This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the global efforts to implement pool testing, specifically for COVID-19 screening. Sources: Data were retrieved from a detailed search for peer-reviewed articles and preprint reports using Medline/PubMed, medRxiv, Web of Science, and Google up to 21st March 2021, using search terms ""pool testing"", ""viral"", ""serum"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""COVID-19"". Content: This review summarizes the history and theory of pool testing. We identified numerous peer-reviewed articles that describe specific details and practical implementation of pool testing. Successful examples as well as limitations of pool testing, in general and specifically related to the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and antibodies, are reviewed. While promising, significant operational, pre-analytical, logistical, and economic challenges need to be overcome to advance pool testing. Implications: The theory of pool testing is well understood and numerous successful examples from the past are available. Operationalization of pool testing requires sophisticated processes that can be adapted to the local medical circumstances. Special attention needs to be paid to sample collection, sample pooling, and strategies to avoid re-sampling."
