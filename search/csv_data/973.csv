9720,Current Imaging Trends in COVID-19 Pneumonia.,"COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a pandemic threatening lives and healthcare systems worldwide. With the emergence of the disease in Nepal, all faculties of medicine need to be well prepared to face the challenge. Fortunately, now plenty of research is available to facilitate our preparedness in the war against COVID-19. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is the current gold standard diagnostic test and chest Computed Tomography scan for screening the disease is considered inappropriate by most society recommendations. The Nepal Radiologists' Association has proposed its guidelines which have been endorsed by the Nepal Medical Council. This article aims to summarize the role of imaging focusing on chest X-ray and Computed Tomography scan including the indications, specific findings, and important differentials. Imaging needs to be done taking necessary precautions, to minimize disease transmission, protect health care personnel, and preserve health care system functioning."
9721,[Replication and transmission mechanisms of highly pathogenic human coronavirus].,"The three known highly pathogenic human coronaviruses are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are composed of non-structural proteins, structural proteins, accessory proteins and ribonucleic acid. Viral particles recognize host receptors via spike glycoprotein (S protein), enter host cells by membrane fusion, replicate in host cells through large replication-transcription complexes, and promote proliferation by interfering with and suppressing the host's immune response. Highly pathogenic human coronaviruses are hosted by humans and vertebrates. Viral particles are transmitted through droplets, contact and aerosols or likely through digestive tract, urine, eyes and other routes. This review discusses the mechanisms of replication and transmission of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses providing basis for future studies on interrupting the transmission and pathogenicity of these pathogenic viruses."
9722,"Review: An insight into coronaviruses: Challenges, security and scope.","SARS-CoV2 is a novel coronavirus; the seventh of its species to infect humans. The spread of this virus emerged in Wuhan, China in late December, 2019. Since then, this virus has spread to more than 200 countries and has caused a worldwide pandemic. Being a new species of coronaviruses, any cure or vaccines for this virus has not yet been obtained. A large amount of scientific studies and clinical trials are being carried out across the world to find a potential vaccine for this virus. Current work reports a review of potential drugs and vaccines that may be effective against this virus. Different scientific therapies that may potentially be effective against the SARS-CoV2 virus are also reviewed. The mechanisms of various drugs, their efficiency in various clinical trials and their side effects are also studied."
9723,Comparison of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 Test with a Laboratory-Developed Assay for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Clinical Nasopharyngeal Specimens.,"Several point-of-care (POC) molecular tests have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The test performance characteristics of the Accula (Mesa Biotech) SARS-CoV-2 POC test need to be evaluated to inform its optimal use. The aim of this study was to assess the test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test. The performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT), targeting the envelope (E) gene. Assay concordance was assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohen's kappa coefficient. Overall percent agreement between the assays was 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.3 to 90.6%), PPA was 68.0% (95% CI, 53.3 to 80.5%), and the kappa coefficient was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.82). Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test and showed low viral load burden, with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA was 100% (95% CI, 94.2 to 100%). Compared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement. However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load. The false-negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pretest probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula."

9725,The Longest Infectious Virus Shedding in a Child Infected With the G614 Strain of SARS-CoV-2.,"COVID-19 spread globally and caused over 97 million cases with more than 2 million deaths. There is still ongoing discussion on the duration of infectious interval SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptomatic children had longer virus shedding and there are some reports of prolonged infectious virus shedding in adults particularly patients having an immunocompromised status. A missense mutation, D614G, in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which has emerged as a predominant clade in Europe and is spreading worldwide that can result in higher viral loads in patients. Herein, we described the longest infectious virus shedding in a previously healthy child infected with SARS-CoV-2 expressing spike D614G substitution."
9726,COVID-19 Vaccines: A Primer for Clinicians.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the identified cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues unabated. This fact, coupled with recurrence of COVID-19 in areas where it had been controlled, highlights the critical need for a safe and effective vaccine to prevent and mitigate this novel virus. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is important in its lifecycle as well as in the development of immunity after human infection. This has prompted the selection of this antigen as a focus in developing COVID-19 vaccines. This article provides (1) a summary of the host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, (2) the vaccine platforms being used with COVID-19 vaccine candidates undergoing, or about to undergo, Phase III clinical trial testing, and (3) an overview of the key criteria necessary for COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and safety. In addition, the unique concept of vaccine-enhanced disease will be discussed. [Pediatr Ann. 2020;49(12):e532-e536.]."
9727,Underestimation of COVID-19 cases in Japan: an analysis of RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 among 47 prefectures in Japan.,"Background: Under the unique Japanese policy to restrict reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a nationwide number of its confirmed cases and mortality remains to be low. Yet the information is lacking on geographical differences of these measures and their associated factors. Aim: Evaluation of prefecture-based geographical differences and associated predictors for the incidence and number of RT-PCR tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design: Cross-sectional study using regression and correlation analysis. Methods: We retrieved domestic laboratory-confirmed cases, deaths and the number of RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 from 15 January to 6 April 2020 in 47 prefectures in Japan, using publicly available data by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We did descriptive analyses of these three measures and identified significant predictors for the incidence and RT-PCR testing through multiple regression analyses and correlates with the number of deaths through correlation analysis. Results: The median prefectural-level incidence and number of RT-PCR testing per 100 000 population were 1.14 and 38.6, respectively. Multiple regression analyses revealed that significant predictors for the incidence were prefectural-level population (P < 0.001) and the number of RT-PCR testing (P = 0.03); and those for RT-PCR testing were the incidence (P = 0.025), available beds (P = 0.045) and cluster infections (P = 0.034). Conclusion: Considering bidirectional association between the incidence and RT-PCR testing, there may have been an underdiagnosed population for the infection. The restraint policy for RT-PCR testing should be revisited to meet the increasing demand under the COVID-19 epidemic."
