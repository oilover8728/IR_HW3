8920,Human convalescent plasma protects K18-hACE2 mice against severe respiratory disease.,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and human infections have resulted in a global health emergency. Small animal models that reproduce key elements of SARS-CoV-2 human infections are needed to rigorously screen candidate drugs to mitigate severe disease and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have reported that transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor under the control of the Keratin 18 (K18) promoter develop severe and lethal respiratory disease subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge. Here we report that some infected mice that survive challenge have residual pulmonary damages and persistent brain infection on day 28 post-infection despite the presence of anti-SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Because of the hypersensitivity of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 and the propensity of virus to infect the brain, we sought to determine if anti-infective biologics could protect against disease in this model system. We demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma protects K18-hACE2 against severe disease. All control mice succumbed to disease by day 7; however, all treated mice survived infection without observable signs of disease. In marked contrast to control mice, viral antigen and lesions were reduced or absent from lungs and absent in brains of antibody-treated mice. Our findings support the use of K18-hACE2 mice for protective efficacy studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 medical countermeasures (MCMs). They also support the use of this system to study SARS-CoV-2 persistence and host recovery."
8921,Orbital inflammatory disease associated with COVID-19 infection.,"Conjunctival congestion has been reported as the most common ophthalmic manifestation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, affecting 18.4%-31.6% of patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Orbital inflammatory disease has been rarely reported in association with COVID-19 infection, with only 2 case reports of adolescent patients having been recently published. We present a unique case of orbital myositis in a 10-year-old boy who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of typical systemic COVID-19 manifestations. Although it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the inflammation or was coincidental, the possible association of the events is concerning."
8922,COVID-19 in Immunocompromised Hosts: What We Know So Far.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused significant morbidity and mortality for patients and stressed healthcare systems worldwide. The clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 among immunosuppressed patients, who are at presumed risk of more severe disease but who may also have decreased detrimental inflammatory responses, are not well characterized. We review the existing literature on COVID-19 among immunocompromised populations ranging from patients with cancer and solid-organ transplant recipients to patients with HIV and those receiving immunomodulatory therapy for autoimmune disease. Patients with malignancy and solid-organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death, whereas for those with other types of immunocompromise, current evidence is less clear. Overall, further prospective controlled studies are needed to determine the attributable risk of immunocompromising conditions and therapies on COVID-19 disease prognosis."
8923,"Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 during Border Quarantine and Air Travel, New Zealand (Aotearoa).","The strategy in New Zealand (Aotearoa) to eliminate coronavirus disease requires that international arrivals undergo managed isolation and quarantine and mandatory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Combining genomic and epidemiologic data, we investigated the origin of an acute case of coronavirus disease identified in the community after the patient had spent 14 days in managed isolation and quarantine and had 2 negative test results. By combining genomic sequence analysis and epidemiologic investigations, we identified a multibranched chain of transmission of this virus, including on international and domestic flights, as well as a probable case of aerosol transmission without direct person-to-person contact. These findings show the power of integrating genomic and epidemiologic data to inform outbreak investigations."
8924,COVID-19: a new emerging respiratory disease from the neurological perspective.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a challenging public health catastrophe worldwide. The newly emerged disease spread in almost all countries and infected 100 million persons worldwide. The infection is not limited to the respiratory system but involves various body systems and may lead to multiple organ failure. Tissue degenerative changes result from direct viral invasion, indirect consequences, or through an uncontrolled immune response. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads to the brain via hematogenous and neural routes accompanied with dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier. The involvement of the central nervous system is now suspected to be among the main causes of death. The present review discusses the historical background of coronaviruses, their role in previous and ongoing pandemics, the way they escape the immune system, why they are able to spread despite all undertaken measures, in addition to the neurological manifestations, long-term consequences of the disease, and various routes of viral introduction to the CNS."
8925,Genetic conservation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication complex in globally circulating isolates and recently emerged variants from humans and minks suggests minimal pre-existing resistance to remdesivir.,"Remdesivir (RDV) exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in ≥0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in ≥0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV."
8926,"Potential therapeutic targets for combating SARS-CoV-2: Drug repurposing, clinical trials and recent advancements.","The present pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has been a tough task for the whole world to deal with. With the absence of specific drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the situation is very difficult to control. Apart from the absence of specific therapies, the lack of knowledge about potential therapeutic targets and individual perception is adding to the complications. The present review describes the novel SARS-CoV-2 structure, surface proteins, asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission in addition to the genotype and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 along with genetic strains and similarity between SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic strategies such as inhibition of the endocytic pathway and suppressing RNA polymerase activity by metal ions, which could be quite beneficial for controlling COVID-19, are outlined. The drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in detail along with therapeutic classes such as antivirals, antibiotics, and amino quinolones and their probable role in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 with reference to case studies. The ongoing clinical trials both with respect to drug repurposing and vaccines are summarized along with a brief description. The recent advancements and future perspective of ongoing research for therapy and detection of SARS-CoV-2 are provided. The review, in brief, summarizes epidemiology, therapy and the current scenario for combating SARS-CoV-2."
8927,A perspective on potential target proteins of COVID-19: Comparison with SARS-CoV for designing new small molecules.,"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemic has created an unprecedented medical and economic crisis all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 is found to have more contagious character as compared to MERS-CoV and is spreading in a very fast manner all around the globe. It has affected over 31 million people all over the world till date. This virus shares around 80% of genome similarity with SARS-CoV. In this perspective, we have explored three major targets namely; SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and 3CL or Mpro Protease for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. These targets have attracted attention of the medicinal chemists working on computer-aided drug design in developing new small molecules that might inhibit these targets for combating COVID-19 disease. Moreover, we have compared the similarity of these target proteins with earlier reported coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have observed that both the coronaviruses share around 80% similarity in their amino acid sequence. The key amino acid interactions which can play a crucial role in designing new small molecule inhibitors against COVID-19 have been reported in this perspective. Authors believe that this study will help the medicinal chemists to understand the key amino acids essential for interactions at the active site of target proteins in SARS-CoV-2, based on their similarity with earlier reported viruses. In this review, we have also described the lead molecules under various clinical trials for their efficacy against COVID-19."
8928,Genetics of COVID-19.,"Objective: This narrative, non-systematic review provides an update on the genetic aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its interactions with the human genome within the context of COVID-19. Although the main focus is on the etiology of this new disease, the genetics of SARS-CoV-2 impacts prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and the development of therapies. Data source: A literature search was conducted on MEDLINE, BioRxiv, and SciELO, as well as a manual search on the internet (mainly in 2019 and 2020) using the keywords ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""genetics,"" ""molecular,"" ""mutation,"" ""vaccine,"" ""Brazil,"" ""Brasil,"" and combinations of these terms. The keywords ""Brazil"" and ""Brasil"" were used to find publications that were specific to the Brazilian population's molecular epidemiology data. Articles most relevant to the scope were selected non-systematically. Data synthesis: A number of publications illustrate an expanding knowledge on the genetics and genomics of SARS-CoV-2 and its implications for understanding COVID-19. Conclusions: Knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence permits an in-depth investigation of the role its proteins play in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, which in turn will be enormously valuable for understanding the evolutionary, clinical, and epidemiological aspects of this disease and focusing on prevention and treatment."
8929,Development and characterization of two equine formulations towards SARS-CoV-2 proteins for the potential treatment of COVID-19.,"In the current global emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, passive immunotherapy emerges as a promising treatment for COVID-19. Among animal-derived products, equine formulations are still the cornerstone therapy for treating envenomations due to animal bites and stings. Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials. The technological strategy we describe here can be adapted by other producers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries."
