6770,Virolactia in an Asymptomatic Mother with COVID-19.,"Background: Limited data are available on the perinatal and postnatal transmission of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommended breastfeeding with necessary precautions to mothers with COVID-19. Case Presentation: A 20-year-old pregnant woman with no symptoms of COVID-19 presented to the hospital for delivery at 39 weeks of gestation. She was tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because her father had been diagnosed with COVID-19. A nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the baby and the mother were cared for separately after delivery. Breast milk obtained after first lactation was tested by real-time RT-PCR and was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: In this article, we aimed to report the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk. Although further studies are needed, this situation may have an impact on breastfeeding recommendations."
6771,Protective efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 in macaques.,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that partially evade neutralizing antibodies poses a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines1,2. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine expresses a stabilized spike protein from the WA1/2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2, and has recently demonstrated protective efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in humans in several geographical regions-including in South Africa, where 95% of sequenced viruses in cases of COVID-19 were the B.1.351 variant3. Here we show that Ad26.COV2.S elicits humoral and cellular immune responses that cross-react with the B.1.351 variant and protects against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques. Ad26.COV2.S induced lower binding and neutralizing antibodies against B.1.351 as compared to WA1/2020, but elicited comparable CD8 and CD4 T cell responses against the WA1/2020, B.1.351, B.1.1.7, P.1 and CAL.20C variants. B.1.351 infection of control rhesus macaques resulted in higher levels of virus replication in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal swabs than did WA1/2020 infection. Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against both WA1/2020 and B.1.351, although we observed higher levels of virus in vaccinated macaques after B.1.351 challenge. These data demonstrate that Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques. Our findings have important implications for vaccine control of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern."
6772,Coronavirus Disease-2019 and dental practice: A project on the use of ozonized water in the water circuit of the dental armchair.,"A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is associated with human-to-human transmission. From its beginning in December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has spread globally from Wuhan and is now declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV includes direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal and eye mucous membranes. The participants in dental practice are exposed to a severe risk of 2019-nCoV infections because of the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids. Dental professionals play great roles in preventing the transmission of 2019-nCoV. Since ozone has a proven anti-viral action, we present a project on the use of ozonized water in the water circuit of the dental armchair, in order to lower the viral load during dental practice in dental clinics and hospitals."
6773,Antigenic sites in SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD show molecular similarity with pathogenic antigenic determinants and harbors peptides for vaccine development.,"The spike protein of coronavirus is key target for drug development and other pharmacological interventions. In current study, we performed an integrative approach to predict antigenic sites in SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain and found nine potential antigenic sites. The predicted antigenic sites were then assessed for possible molecular similarity with other known antigens in different organisms. Out of nine sites, seven sites showed molecular similarity with 54 antigenic determinants found in twelve pathogenic bacterial species (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Bacillus anthracis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, Helicobacter Pylori, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Vibrio cholera and Yersinia pestis), two malarial parasites (Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi) and influenza virus A. Most of the bacterial antigens that displayed molecular similarity with antigenic sites in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain) were toxins and virulent factors. Antigens from Mycobacterium that showed similarity were mainly involved in modulating host cell immune response and ensuring persistence and survival of pathogen in host cells. Presence of a large number of antigenic determinants, similar to those in highly pathogenic microorganisms, not merely accounts for complex etiology of the disease but also provides an explanation for observed pathophysiological complications, such as deregulated immune response, unleashed or dysregulated cytokine secretion (cytokine storm), multiple organ failure etc., that are more evident in aged and immune-compromised patients. Over-representation of antigenic determinants from Plasmodium and Mycobacterium in all antigenic sites suggests that anti-malarial and anti-TB drugs can prove to be clinical beneficial for COVID-19 treatment. Besides this, anti-leprosy, anti-lyme, anti-plague, anti-anthrax drugs/vaccine etc. are also expected to be beneficial in COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, individuals previously immunized/vaccinated or had previous history of malaria, tuberculosis or other disease caused by fifteen microorganisms are expected to display a considerable degree of resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Out of the seven antigenic sites predicted in SARS-CoV-2, a part of two antigenic sites were also predicted as potent T-cell epitopes (KVGGNYNYL444-452 and SVLYNSASF366-374) against MHC class I and three (KRISNCVADYSVLYN356-370, DLCFTNVYADSFVI389-402, and YRVVVLSFELLHA508-520) against MHC class II. All epitopes possessed significantly lower predicted IC50 value which is a prerequisite for a preferred vaccine candidate for COVID-19."

6776,"Computers and viral diseases. Preliminary bioinformatics studies on the design of a synthetic vaccine and a preventative peptidomimetic antagonist against the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV, COVID-19) coronavirus.","This paper concerns study of the genome of the Wuhan Seafood Market isolate believed to represent the causative agent of the disease COVID-19. This is to find a short section or sections of viral protein sequence suitable for preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. The project was originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. The work can, nonetheless, be described in traditional bioinformatics terms, and readily reproduced by others, albeit with the caveat that new data and research into 2019-nCoV is emerging and evolving at an explosive pace. Preliminary studies using molecular modeling and docking, and in that context the potential value of certain known herbal extracts, are also described."
