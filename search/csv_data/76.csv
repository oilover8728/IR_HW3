750,Outcome of Covid-19 Positive Newborns Presenting to a Tertiary Care Hospital.,"Neonatal data regarding SARS-CoV-2 is sparse from India. On review of hospital records from April- August, 2020, 18/423 (4.25%) neonates were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. 15 (83.3%) neonates recovered and 3 (16.6%) succumbed. Only 50% of the positive babies had positive mothers/ caretakers, a contact could not be traced in others."
751,Virus isolation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for diagnostic and research purposes.,"Isolation of the new pandemic virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for diagnostic and research purposes including assessment of novel therapeutics. Several primary and continuous cell lines are currently used, and new organoid and engineered cell lines are being developed for improved investigation and understanding of the human immune response to this virus. Here we review the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in reference standard cell lines, engineered cell lines and new developments in this field."
752,"Clinical characteristics, cause analysis and infectivity of COVID-19 nucleic acid repositive patients: A literature review.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a serious threat to human health and lives. The virus is still spreading throughout the world, and the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing. After patients with COVID-19 are treated and discharged, some have repeated clinical symptoms and become positive for nucleic acid tests a second time. Through analysis and review of the existing literature, the proportion of repositive patients in the discharged patient population and their clinical characteristics were systematically described for the first time. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the causes of repositive nucleic acid tests and the potential transmission of the disease provides the basis for the management and protection of discharged patients with COVID-19."

754,Plasma as an alternative COVID-19 diagnostic specimen in a hospitalized patient negative for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab.,"We present the case of an inpatient with pneumonia and repeatedly negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 testing. In such challenging cases, alternative diagnostic options include lower respiratory tract and plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing, of which the latter may be particularly useful where bronchoscopy is deferred due to clinical factors or transmission risk."
755,The Challenge of Using an Antigen Test as a Screening Tool for SARS-CoV-2 Infection in an Emergency Department: Experience of a Tertiary Care Hospital in Southern Italy.,"Background: In emergency hospital settings, rapid diagnosis and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 patients are required. The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of an antigen chemiluminescence enzymatic immunoassay (CLEIA) and compare it with that of Real-time Reverse transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), the gold standard assay, to assess its suitability as a rapid diagnostic method for managing patients in the emergency department (ED). Methods: Consecutive patients with no previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection attending the ED of the Policlinico Hospital of Bari between 23rd October and 4th November 2020 were enrolled. Clinical and demographic data were collected for all patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected on admission were subjected both to molecular (RT-qPCR) and antigen (CLEIA) tests for SARS-CoV-2. The performance of the CLEIA antigen test was analyzed using R Studio software and Microsoft Excel. Receiver operating characteristics were also performed. Results: A total of 911 patients were enrolled, of whom 469 (51.5%) were male. Of the whole cohort, 23.7% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR and 24.5% by CLEIA. The overall concordance rate was 96.8%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the antigen test were 94.9% (95% CI, 91.9-97.0), 97.4% (95% CI, 96.5-98.1), 91.9% (95% CI, 89.0-94.0), and 98.4% (95% CI, 97.4-99.1), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.99. The kappa coefficient was 0.91. The overall positive and negative likelihood ratios were 37 (95% CI 23-58) and 0.05 (95% CI, 0.03-0.09), respectively. Conclusions: Data analysis demonstrated that the antigen test showed very good accuracy for discriminating SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from negative participants. The CLEIA is suitable for rapid clinical diagnosis of patients in hospital settings, particularly in EDs with a high prevalence of symptomatic patients and where a rapid turnaround time is critical. Timely and accurate testing for SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in limiting the spread of the virus."
756,Virus Eradication and Synthetic Biology: Changes with SARS-CoV-2?,"The eradication of infectious diseases has been achieved only once in history, in 1980, with smallpox. Since 1988, significant effort has been made to eliminate poliomyelitis viruses, but eradication is still just out of reach. As the goal of viral disease eradication approaches, the ability to recreate historically eradicated viruses using synthetic biology has the potential to jeopardize the long-term sustainability of eradication. However, the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 pandemic has highlighted our ability to swiftly and resolutely respond to a potential outbreak. This virus has been synthetized faster than any other in the past and is resulting in vaccines before most attenuated candidates reach clinical trials. Here, synthetic biology has the opportunity to demonstrate its truest potential to the public and solidify a footing in the world of vaccines."

758,SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and serology testing of COVID-19 convalescent plasma from donors with nonsevere disease.,"Background: The transfer of passive immunity with convalescent plasma is a promising strategy for treatment and prevention of COVID-19, but donors with a history of nonsevere disease are serologically heterogenous. The relationship between SARS-Cov-2 antigen-binding activity and neutralization activity in this population of donors has not been defined. Study design and methods: Convalescent plasma units from 47 individuals with a history of nonsevere COVID-19 were assessed for antigen-binding activity of using three clinical diagnostic serology assays (Beckman, DiaSorin, and Roche) with different SARS-CoV-2 targets. These results were compared with functional neutralization activity using a fluorescent reporter strain of SARS-CoV-2 in a microwell assay. Results: Positive correlations of varying strength (Spearman r = 0.37-0.52) between antigen binding and viral neutralization were identified. Donors age 48 to 75 years had the highest neutralization activity. Units in the highest tertile of binding activity for each assay were enriched (75%-82%) for those with the highest levels of neutralization. Conclusion: The strength of the relationship between antigen-binding activity and neutralization varies depending on the clinical assay used. Units in the highest tertile of binding activity for each assay are predominantly comprised of those with the greatest neutralization activity."
759,[Covid-19 serology in nursing home and long-term care: prevalence of seroconversion in the Amiens-Picardie University Hospital].,"Since December 2019, an emerging infectious viral disease implicating a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic. Elderly people, being more fragile, are the most affected by the severity and lethality of this disease. The NH and LTCU of the Amiens University Hospital registered their first Covid-19 cases in February 2020, which lead to the opening of a Covid-19 dedicated unit and of specific protocol for confinement. This descriptive study was analyzing the prevalence of Covid-19 seroconversion within the NH and the LTCU of the Amiens University Hospital. Both this screening test and the nasopharyngeal swab PCRs were in order to assess the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic in NH and LTCU. On June 15th and 16th, the serological tests for Covid-19 were positive for 146 (66.1%) of the residents tested. The seroconversion rate was significantly different (p < 0.001) between the NH (88.7%) and the LTCU (45.6%). During the epidemic, there was no excess mortality index within the NH and LTCU services of the Amiens University Hospital. Among frail patients, the role of immunosenescence can be discussed to account for the absence of this inflammatory reaction. This study showed that isolating the infected patient in a dedicated unit significantly reduces the risk of seroconversion and contamination compared to isolating them within their own unit."
