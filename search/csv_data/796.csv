7950,Amantadine Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro.,"Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in late 2019, the search for protective vaccines and for drug treatments has become mandatory to fight the global health emergency. Travel restrictions, social distancing, and face masks are suitable counter measures, but may not bring the pandemic under control because people will inadvertently or at a certain degree of restriction severity or duration become incompliant with the regulations. Even if vaccines are approved, the need for antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 will persist. However, unequivocal evidence for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 has not been demonstrated for any of the repurposed antiviral drugs so far. Amantadine was approved as an antiviral drug against influenza A, and antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 has been reasoned by analogy but without data. We tested the efficacy of amantadine in vitro in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, amantadine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in two separate experiments with IC50 concentrations between 83 and 119 µM. Although these IC50 concentrations are above therapeutic amantadine levels after systemic administration, topical administration by inhalation or intranasal instillation may result in sufficient amantadine concentration in the airway epithelium without high systemic exposure. However, further studies in other models are needed to prove this hypothesis."
7951,Primary care for patients with respiratory tract infection before and early on in the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study in 16 European countries.,"Objective: To describe primary health care (consultation characteristics and management) for patients contacting their general practitioner (GP) with a respiratory tract infection (RTI) early on in the COVID-19 pandemic in contrasting European countries, with comparison to prepandemic findings. Setting: Primary care in 16 countries (79 practices), when no routine SARS-CoV-2 testing was generally available. Design and participants: Before (n=4376) and early in the pandemic (n=3301), patients with RTI symptoms were registered in this prospective audit study. Outcome measures: Consultation characteristics (type of contact and use of PPE) and management characteristics (clinical assessments, diagnostic testing, prescribing, advice and referral) were registered. Differences in these characteristics between countries and between pandemic and prepandemic care are described. Results: Care for patients with RTIs rapidly switched to telephone/video consultations (10% in Armenia, 91% in Denmark), and when consultations were face-to-face, GPs used PPE during 97% (95% CI 96% to 98%) of contacts. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 in primary care patients with RTIs was rapidly implemented in Denmark (59%) and Germany (31%), while overall testing for C reactive protein decreased. The proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics varied considerably between countries (3% in Belgium, 48% in UK) and was lower during the pandemic compared with the months before, except for Greece, Poland and UK. GPs provided frequent and varied COVID-related advice and more frequently scheduled a follow-up contact (50%, 95% CI 48% to 52%). GPs reported a slightly higher degree of confidence in the likely effectiveness of their management in face-to-face (73% (very) confident, 95% CI 71% to 76%) than in virtual consultations (69%, 95% CI 67% to 71%). Conclusions: Despite between-country variation in consultation characteristics, access to SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing and medication prescribing, GPs reported a high degree of confidence in managing their patients with RTIs in the emerging pandemic. Insight in the highly variable pandemic responses, as measured in this multicountry audit, can aid in fine-tuning national action and in coordinating a pan-European response during future pandemic threats."
7952,[COVID-19: Warp Speed vaccines].,"A vaccine is required to effectively control the COVID-19 pandemic in the mid and long term. The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 was initiated as soon as the genetic sequence of the virus was published, and has evolved at an unprecedented speed, with a first clinical trial launched in March 2020. One year later, more than a dozen of vaccines based on different concepts, with some having been evaluated only in clinical trials so far, are authorized under emergency procedures. Here, we review these vaccines, compare their properties and discuss the challenges they face, including the emergence of viral variants of concern."
7953,Epidemiological and clinical features of Croatian children and adolescents with a PCR-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019: differences between the first and second epidemic wave.,"Aim: To describe epidemiological and clinical features of Croatian children and adolescents with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. Methods: Data on patients aged ≤19 years with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test recorded in the period March 12-May 12 (first wave) and June 19-July 19, 2020 (second wave) were retrospectively analyzed. The periods were separated by several weeks with no incident cases. Results: We analyzed data on 289 children and adolescents (6.5% of all cases; incidence rate [IR]=3.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.14-3.97/million person-days), 124 in the first wave (IR=2.27) and 165 in the second wave (IR=6.37): IRR second/first=2.71 (2.13-3.44). During the first wave, the incidence was highest in infants (IR=3.48), while during the second wave it progressively increased to IR = 7.37 in 15-19-year olds. Family members were the key epidemiological contacts (72.6% cases), particularly during the first wave (95.8% vs 56.3%). Overall, 41.3% patients were asymptomatic, 25.3% in the first and 52.6% in the second wave. Age 15-19 years (vs younger) was associated with a higher (RR = 1.26, 1.02-1.54) and infection in the second wave with a lower probability (RR=0.66, 0.53-0.81) of being symptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and rhinorrhea. In children aged ≥7 years, headache, anosmia/ageusia, and sore throat were also recorded. Only one child suffered a severe disease. All but 18 (7.8%) children were treated only symptomatically, and all fully recovered. Conclusion: A large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive children/adolescents were asymptomatic. The associated disease was predominantly mild, comparably so in the first and second pandemic wave."
7954,Is there a role for immune-enhancing therapies for acutely ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019?,"Purpose of review: Although the so-called cytokine storm has been early described and related to a dramatic evolution in severe COVID-19 patients, it soon became clear that those patients display clinical and biological evidence of an immunosuppressive state characterized, among other, by a profound lymphopenia. The negative role of this immune suppression on the outcome raises the question on immune therapies that might improve patient's condition. Recent findings: Important positive effects of active immune therapies, such as IL-7 or thymosin-α are already described and warrant confirmation in larger prospective trials. For other therapies, such as interferons, firm conclusions for critically ill COVID-19 patients are lacking as those patients were often excluded from the published trials. Treatment with immunoglobulins or convalescent plasma is a passive strategy to provide specific immunity. Unfortunately, results from large RCTs do not support their use presently. Summary: In this article, we provide a review on active and passive immune boosting strategies that might help treating the most severe COVID-19 patients. We mainly focus on active strategies that include IL-7, thymosin-α, interferons, and vitamin D. Although some positive effects are described, they certainly warrant confirmation in large randomized controlled trials."
7955,A Case of Covid-19 Diagnosed at Home With Portable Ultrasound and Confirmed With Home Serology Test.,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has pushed us to find better ways to accurately diagnose what can be an elusory disease, preferably in a way that limits exposure to others. The potential for home diagnosis and monitoring could reduce infectious risk for other patients and health care providers, limit use of finite hospital resources, and enable better social distancing and isolation practices. Case report: We report a case of an otherwise healthy emergency physician diagnosed with COVID-19 at home using portable ultrasound, pulse oximetry, and antibody testing. Her clinical picture and typical lung findings of COVID-19 on ultrasound, combined with a normal echocardiogram and negative deep vein thrombosis study, helped inform her diagnosis. She then monitored her clinical course using pulse oximetry, was able to self-isolate for 4 weeks, and had an uneventful recovery. Her diagnosis was confirmed with a positive IgG antibody test after 3 weeks. Conclusions: Novel times call for novel solutions and our case demonstrates one possible path for home diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. The tools used, namely ultrasound and pulse oximetry, should be familiar to most emergency physicians. Ultrasound in particular was helpful in eliminating other potential diagnoses, such as pulmonary embolus."

7957,Anosmia and dysgeusia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: an age-matched case-control study.,"Background: Anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported as potential symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019. This study aimed to confirm whether anosmia and dysgeusia are specific symptoms among those who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: We conducted an age-matched case-control study in the Eastern Townships region of Quebec between Mar. 10 and Mar. 23, 2020. We included adults (age ≥ 18 yr) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cases were matched (1:1) according to 5-year age groups with control patents selected randomly from among all patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the same period. Demographic and laboratory information was collected from medical records. Clinical symptoms and comorbidities associated with anosmia and dysgeusia were obtained by telephone interview with a standardized questionnaire. Results: Among 2883 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, we identified 134 positive cases (70 women [52.2%] and 64 men [47.8%]; median age 57.1 [interquartile range 41.2-64.5] yr). The symptoms independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in conditional logistic regression were anosmia or dysgeusia or both (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 62.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.0-359.7), presence of myalgia (adjusted OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.9-29.9), blurred vision (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.8) and chest pain (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.6). Interpretation: We found a strong association between olfactory and gustatory symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. These symptoms should be considered as common and distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should serve as an indication for testing and possible retesting of people whose first test result is negative."
7958,[The Challenges of Vaccine Development Against Betacoronaviruses: Antibody Dependent Enhancement and Sendai Virus as a Possible Vaccine Vector].,"To design an effective and safe vaccine against betacoronaviruses, it is necessary to elicit a combination of strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses as well as to minimize the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection. This phenomenon was observed in animal trials of experimental vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV that were developed based on inactivated coronavirus or vector constructs expressing the spike protein (S) of the virion. The substitution and glycosylation of certain amino acids in the antigenic determinants of the S-protein, as well as its conformational changes, can lead to the same effect in a new experimental vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This review outlines approaches for developing vaccines against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that are based on non-pathogenic viral vectors. For efficient prevention of infections caused by respiratory pathogens the ability of the vaccine to stimulate mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract is important. Such a vaccine can be developed using non-pathogenic Sendai virus vector, since it can be administered intranasally and induce a mucosal immune response that strengthens the antiviral barrier in the respiratory tract and provides reliable protection against infection. The mucosal immunity and the production of IgA antibodies accompanying its development reduces the likelihood of developing an antibody-dependent infection enhancement, which is usually associated only with immunopathological IgG antibodies."
