8820,Coronavirus disease 2019 in children.,"Purpose of review: Over the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it has become clear that the clinical features, epidemiology, and outcomes of COVID-19 are distinct in children relative to adults. In this review, we will present recent pediatric studies informing our current understanding of COVID-19 in children, and review pediatric considerations surrounding disease transmission, currently available therapies, and vaccination. Recent findings: Recent studies have shed light on the clinical epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children, identifying a high prevalence of asymptomatic and mild infections, with severe COVID-19 infrequently reported. Several adult clinical trials have informed the use of remdesivir, anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies, dexamethasone, and tocilizumab in the management of COVID-19. Associations between underlying comorbid medical conditions and severe outcomes, as well as transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in children, are complex and warrant further study. Finally, highly efficacious vaccines are available for adults and adolescents, with pediatric trials ongoing. Summary: Children generally fare well with acute COVID-19 infection, though critical illness is possible. Future research should focus on clarifying the role of children in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and optimal prevention strategies, particularly in the school setting, as well as evaluating pediatric vaccine candidates."

8822,Evaluation of Two Chemiluminescent and Three ELISA Immunoassays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies: Implications for Disease Diagnosis and Patients' Management.,"The estimation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is possibly the best approach to accurately establish the number of infected individuals and the seroprevalence of COVID-19 within a population. Thus, several commercial immunoassays have recently been developed. The purpose of our study was to assess the performance of five commonly used immunoassays in Greece (3 ELISA, namely Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2, GA GENERIC SARS-CoV-2 and Vircell COVID-19; and 2 chemiluminescent, namely ABBOTT SARS-CoV-2 and ROCHE Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Sera specimens derived from 168 individuals were utilized to assess the specificity and sensitivity score of each assay. Among them, we included 99 COVID-19 patients (29 asymptomatic, 36 with symptom onset 4 to 14 days before serum sampling, and 34 with symptom initiation ≥ 15 days ago), and 69 volunteers with sera specimens collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and maintained at -80°C. We demonstrated that chemiluminescent immunoassays exhibit a significantly higher specificity score but a lower sensitivity, compared to ELISA immunoassays. Moreover, immunoassays detecting IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 N protein instead of S protein alone are more reliable, considering both specificity and sensitivity scores. Interestingly, all asymptomatic patients displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, confirmed by at least two immunoassays. We suggest that chemiluminescent assays could be used as screening methods for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to evaluate the possible prevalence of disease in the general population, while ELISA assays would be more reliable to evaluate, and follow-up confirmed COVID-19 patients."

8824,Covid-19 skin manifestations: an update.,"Purpose of review: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 is a multisystemic disease manifesting mainly with dry cough, fever, and pneumonia and can present with a myriad of cutaneous manifestations. This chapter will review SARS-CoV-2 associated cutaneous findings, including incidence and relevance to the pediatric population. Recent findings: The most commonly reported cutaneous findings described for COVID-19 in adults and children were chilblains-like lesions, followed by maculopapular eruption, urticarial lesions, vesicular lesions, and livedoid lesions. Children can also present with erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions and skin findings associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Summary: There are numerous cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19, some of which are unique to children such as EM-like lesions and skin findings for MIS-C. Livedoid lesions do not commonly occur in the pediatric population. In mild cases, supportive care is indicated, whereas severe cases warrant intensive care and hospitalization."
8825,"Genomic Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, Colombia.","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Colombia was first diagnosed in a traveler arriving from Italy on February 26, 2020. However, limited data are available on the origins and number of introductions of COVID-19 into the country. We sequenced the causative agent of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from 43 clinical samples we collected, along with another 79 genome sequences available from Colombia. We investigated the emergence and importation routes for SARS-CoV-2 into Colombia by using epidemiologic, historical air travel, and phylogenetic observations. Our study provides evidence of multiple introductions, mostly from Europe, and documents >12 lineages. Phylogenetic findings validate the lineage diversity, support multiple importation events, and demonstrate the evolutionary relationship of epidemiologically linked transmission chains. Our results reconstruct the early evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia and highlight the advantages of genome sequencing to complement COVID-19 outbreak investigations."
8826,Mental Health Issues During and After COVID-19 Vaccine Era.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has persisted for more than a year, and post-COVID-19 sequelae of neurological complications, including direct and indirect effects on the central nervous system (CNS), have been recognized. There is a plethora of evidence for neurological, cognitive, and emotional deficits in COVID-19 patients. Acute neurological symptoms like neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment, loss of smell, and brain stroke are common direct effects among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Work-associated stress, lockdowns, social distancing, and quarantine in response to contain SARS-CoV-2 have also affected the mental health of large populations, regardless of age. Public health emergencies have affected individuals and communities, resulting in emotional reactions and unhealthy behaviors. Although vaccines have been widely distributed and administered among large populations, vaccine hesitancy still exists and may be due to apprehension about vaccine efficacy, preliminary trials, and associated side effects. This review highlights the impact of COVID-19 on the CNS by outlining direct and indirect effects and factors contributing to the decline in people's mental health throughout the COVID-19 pandemic both during and after vaccine administration. Furthermore, we also discuss reasons for vaccine hesitancy and why some groups of people are deprived of vaccines. Finally, we touched upon the social determinants of mental health and their impact on disadvantaged populations during times of crisis which may help policymakers set up some action plans to mitigate the COVID-19 mental health turmoil during this ongoing pandemic."
8827,To Ki or Not to Ki: Re-Evaluating the Use and Potentials of Ki-67 for T Cell Analysis.,"This study discusses substantive advances in T cell proliferation analysis, with the aim to provoke a re-evaluation of the generally-held view that Ki-67 is a reliable proliferation marker per se, and to offer a more sensitive and effective method for T cell cycle analysis, with informative examples in mouse and human settings. We summarize recent experimental work from our labs showing that, by Ki-67/DNA dual staining and refined flow cytometric methods, we were able to identify T cells in the S-G2/M phases of the cell-cycle in the peripheral blood (collectively termed ""T Double S"" for T cells in S-phase in Sanguine: in short ""TDS"" cells). Without our refinement, such cells may be excluded from conventional lymphocyte analyses. Specifically, we analyzed clonal expansion of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in vaccinated mice, and demonstrated the potential of TDS cells to reflect immune dynamics in human blood samples from healthy donors, and patients with type 1 diabetes, infectious mononucleosis, and COVID-19. The Ki-67/DNA dual staining, or TDS assay, provides a reliable approach by which human peripheral blood can be used to reflect the dynamics of human lymphocytes, rather than providing mere steady-state phenotypic snapshots. The method does not require highly sophisticated ""-omics"" capabilities, so it should be widely-applicable to health care in diverse settings. Furthermore, our results argue that the TDS assay can provide a window on immune dynamics in extra-lymphoid tissues, a long-sought potential of peripheral blood monitoring, for example in relation to organ-specific autoimmune diseases and infections, and cancer immunotherapy."
8828,Minireview: The Introduction of COVID-19 and Microvascular Disease-Introduction of COVID-19 and the Relationship between Its Receptor and Diabetic Vascular Complications.,"In December of 2019, a novel coronavirus, which is SARS-CoV-2, broke out in the world and caused tremendous human and financial losses. According to a descriptive study by the relative hospital about the epidemiological and clinical features of 52 critically ill patients, the expert panel found that people with cardiovascular disease and diabetes comprise a large proportion of the patients with chronic disease. In this review, we discuss the structural biology of the SARS-CoV-2 in combination with the characteristics of its binding protein, ACE2, which is an important receptor in the cardiovascular system and may have potential relationships with various diabetic diseases. We hope we can provide useful recommendations for patients with diabetes after becoming infected by the virus or provide directions to doctors on treatment options."
8829,Neurological involvement of COVID-19: from neuroinvasion and neuroimmune crosstalk to long-term consequences.,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a multidimensional threat to humanity, more evidence of neurological involvement associated with it has emerged. Neuroimmune interaction may prove to be important not only in the pathogenesis of neurological manifestations but also to prevent systemic hyperinflammation. In this review, we summarize reports of COVID-19 cases with neurological involvement, followed by discussion of possible routes of entry, immune responses against coronavirus infection in the central nervous system and mechanisms of nerve degeneration due to viral infection and immune responses. Possible mechanisms for neuroprotection and virus-associated neurological consequences are also discussed."
