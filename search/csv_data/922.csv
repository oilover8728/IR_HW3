9212,[Rationality of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction based on literature analysis].,"Qingfei Paidu Decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine compound recommended by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for clinical therapies of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). Qingfei Paidu Decoction consists of 21 traditional Chinese medicines, such as Asari Radix et Rhizoma. However, the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma has been questioned by some people, because of one ancient proverb. To explore the rationality of the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction, this study systematically examined the ancient and modern physicians' understanding of the toxicity of Asari Radix et Rhizoma, and collated the application and dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in ancient prescriptions and modern clinics based on literature analysis. As a result, we found that ancient and modern physicians have different understanding on the toxicity of Asari Radix et Rhizoma and that the theory about the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma is flawed. We also found that the dose of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in ancient and modern clinical applications was not constrained by ancient experience. Physicians usually increase the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in clinical therapy according to the actual conditions, and there were no adverse reactions. Additionally, according to laws and regulations concerning medical affairs, physician could increase or decrease the dosage of the drug under special circumstances. Based on the analysis of safety and effectiveness of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction, we conclude that the dose of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction is safe, effective and reasonable."
9213,COVID-19 in Immunocompromised Cancer Patients: A Case Series and Review of the Literature.,"The global pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented newfound challenges to the oncology community regarding management of disease progression in immunocompromised and cancer patients. Further, the large influx of COVID-19 patients has overwhelmed healthcare facilities, limited access to intensive care unit beds and ventilators, and canceled elective surgeries causing disruptions to the cancer care continuum and re-organization of oncological care. While it is known that the potential threat of infection is greatest in elderly patients (>60 years of age) and patients with underlying comorbidities, there is still insufficient data to determine the risk of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Given the immunosuppressive status in cancer patients arising from chemotherapy and other comorbidities, management of COVID-19 in this patient population carries a unique set of challenges. We report three cases of COVID-19 in immunocompromised cancer patients and discuss the challenges in preventing, diagnosing, and treating this vulnerable group."
9214,Management of patients at risk of anaphylaxis after COVID 19 vaccination.,"The success of a vaccination campaign depends on the possibility of guaranteeing not only a wide distribution of effective vaccines, but also on their safety and acceptance by the population. Vaccine safety questions should be answered by correct, unbiased and evidence-based reports, and by addressing all possible problems including allergic reactions. Despite the fact that many COVID-19 vaccines are free from the majority of potentially sensitizing components, an allergic reaction can occur even in the form of a severe, life-threatening anaphylaxis. The frequency of allergic reactions against COVID vaccine is greater than that observed for other vaccinations. National and international allergology societies have proposed specific guidelines for individuals at risk of anaphylaxis by vaccine. Vaccines, like all the pharmaceutical preparations, are submitted to great safety and efficacy valuations, however, even the greatest pre-licensure experimentations are insufficient to evaluate the vaccine's potential to provoke anaphylaxis. Therefore, post-market surveillance is essential to analyze, record and characterize all adverse events. To this purpose, specific algorithms should be used as a monitoring strategy of adverse events in patients undergoing vaccination against COVID 19."
9215,DBCOVP: A database of coronavirus virulent glycoproteins.,"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 (2002), novel coronaviruses have emerged periodically like the MERS- CoV (2012) and now, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak which has posed a global threat to public health. Although, this is the third zoonotic coronavirus breakout within the last two decades, there are only a few platforms that provide information about coronavirus genomes. None of them is specific for the virulence glycoproteins and complete sequence-structural features of these virulence factors across the betacoronavirus family including SARS-CoV-2 strains are lacking. Against this backdrop, we present DBCOVP (http://covp.immt.res.in/), the first manually-curated, web-based resource to provide extensive information on the complete repertoire of structural virulent glycoproteins from coronavirus genomes belonging to betacoronavirus genera. The database provides various sequence-structural properties in which users can browse and analyze information in different ways. Furthermore, many conserved T-cell and B-cell epitopes predicted for each protein are present that may perform a significant role in eliciting the humoral and cellular immune response. The tertiary structure of the epitopes together with the docked epitope-HLA binding-complex is made available to facilitate further analysis. DBCOVP presents an easy-to-use interface with in-built tools for similarity search, cross-genome comparison, phylogenetic, and multiple sequence alignment. DBCOVP will certainly be an important resource for experimental biologists engaged in coronavirus research studies and will aid in vaccine development."
9216,Value of chest imaging in the newborn with suspected COVID-19.,"Objective: This paper presents a newborn (G2P2, gestational age of 39+6 weeks, birth weight of 3,200 g, with normal fetal amniotic fluid) with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to our hospital on February 10, 2020, at the birth age of 16 hours and 34 minutes. The Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min were 9 and 10 points, respectively. Patients and methods: The mother of the newborn was exposed to a patient with COVID-19 five days before delivery. The newborn had nausea and vomiting after birth, with feeding intolerance, and full enteral feeding was given on the 6th day after birth. The newborn was in good general condition during the period of hospitalization. Results: The two 2019-nCoV nucleic acid tests of the newborn were negative on the 5th and 7th days after birth. On the 1st and 8th days after birth, typical pulmonary lesions were detected in the newborn by chest CT. Our study supports that chest imaging examination should be actively performed in the newborn even with a negative 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test in cases where a pregnant woman is exposed to a patient with COVID-19 or is confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection. Conclusions: For newborns with typical pulmonary lesions, strict quarantine measures are suggested if the possibility of COVID-19 cannot be excluded."
9217,"Current development of COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics.","A novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019. The rapidly increasing number of cases has caused worldwide panic. In this review, we describe some currently applied diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutics and vaccines, to prevent, treat and control further outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
9218,Development of a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid and direct visual detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"Rapid diagnosis is an important intervention in managing the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) remains the primary means for diagnosing the new virus strain but it is time consuming and costly. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal amplification assay that does not require a PCR machine. It is an affordable, rapid, and simple assay. In this study, we developed and optimized a sensitive reverse transcription (RT)-RPA assay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 using SYBR Green I and/or lateral flow (LF) strip. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the RT-RPA assay were tested by using 10-fold serial diluted synthetic RNA and genomic RNA of similar viruses, respectively. Clinical sensitivity and specificity of the RT-RPA assay were carried out using 78 positive and 35 negative nasopharyngeal samples. The detection limit of both RPA and RT-qPCR assays was 7.659 and 5 copies/Î¼L RNA, respectively with no cross reactivity with other viruses. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of RT-RPA were 98% and 100%, respectively. Our study showed that RT-RPA represents a viable alternative to RT-qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, especially in areas with limited infrastructure."
9219,COVID-19 vaccines for patients with cancer: benefits likely outweigh risks.,"Less than a year since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, ten vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved for at least limited use, with over sixty others in clinical trials. This swift achievement has generated excitement and arrives at a time of great need, as the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide continues to rapidly increase. Two vaccines are currently approved for full use, both built on mRNA and lipid nanotechnology platforms, a success story of mRNA technology 20 years in the making. For patients with cancer, questions arise around the safety and efficacy of these vaccines in the setting of immune alterations engendered by their malignancy and/or therapies. We summarize the current data on leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates and vaccination of patients undergoing immunomodulatory cancer treatments. Most current cancer therapeutics should not prevent the generation of protective immunity. We call for more research in this area and recommend that the majority of patients with cancer receive COVID vaccinations when possible."
