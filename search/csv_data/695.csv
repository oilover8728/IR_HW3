6941,COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Among Healthcare Workers and Non-healthcare Workers in China: A Survey.,"Background: The coronavirus pneumonia is still spreading around the world. Much progress has been made in vaccine development, and vaccination will become an inevitable trend in the fight against this pandemic. However, the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination still remains uncertain. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was used in Wen Juan Xing survey platform. All the respondents were divided into healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the key sociodemographic, cognitive, and attitude associations among the samples of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers. Results: A total of 2,580 respondents completed the questionnaire, including 1,329 healthcare workers and 1,251 non-healthcare workers. This study showed that 76.98% of healthcare workers accepted the COVID-19 vaccine, 18.28% workers were hesitant, and 4.74% workers were resistant. Among the non-healthcare workers, 56.19% workers received the COVID-19 vaccine, 37.57% workers were hesitant, and 6.24% workers were resistant. Among the healthcare workers, compared with vaccine recipients, vaccine-hesitant individuals were more likely to be female (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.12-2.07); vaccine-resistant individuals were more likely to live in the suburbs (AOR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.44-3.99) with an income of 10,000 RMB or greater (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.03-3.90). Among the non-healthcare workers, vaccine-hesitant individuals were more likely to be female (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.31-2.11); vaccine-resistant individuals were also more likely to be female (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.16-3.02) and older than 65 years (AOR = 4.96, 95% CI: 1.40-7.62). There are great differences between healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers in their cognition and attitude toward vaccines. Conclusions: Our study shows that healthcare workers are more willing to be vaccinated than non-healthcare workers. Current vaccine safety issues continue to be a major factor affecting public acceptance, and to expand vaccine coverage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, appropriate vaccination strategies and immunization programs are essential, especially for non-healthcare workers."
6942,COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis on rituximab: case-based review.,"A 77-year-old man with past medical history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) on rituximab and prednisone, presented to the hospital with worsening cough and shortness of breath. He had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by nasal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) while asymptomatic, 6 weeks earlier. He started with cough and shortness of breath 2 weeks after his initial positive test. After developing symptoms, he tested negative twice by nasal swab PCR, but the PCR of his bronchioloalveolar lavage was positive for SARS-CoV-2. He did not develop antibodies against coronavirus. Prednisone 15 mg daily was continued, and he received remdesivir, and convalescent plasma with quick recovery. We reviewed the literature to search for similar cases. Our case suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients on rituximab may have an atypical presentation and the diagnosis may be delayed due to negative PCR testing in the nasal swab. Patients may benefit from treatment with convalescent plasma."

6944,Diagnostic yield of bacteriological tests and predictors of severe outcome in adult patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department.,"Background: Guidelines recommend maximal efforts to obtain blood and sputum cultures in patients with COVID-19, as bacterial coinfection is associated with worse outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield of bacteriological tests, including blood and sputum cultures, and the association of multiple biomarkers and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) with clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department (ED). Methods: This is a substudy of a large observational cohort study (PredictED study). The PredictED included adult patients from whom a blood culture was drawn at the ED of Haga Teaching Hospital, The Netherlands. For this substudy, all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in March and April 2020 were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial coinfection. We used logistic regression analysis for associations of procalcitonin, C reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score with a severe disease course, defined as intensive care unit admission and/or 30-day mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) quantified the discriminatory performance. Results: We included 142 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. On presentation, the median duration of symptoms was 8 days. 41 (29%) patients had a severe disease course and 24 (17%) died within 30 days. The incidence of bacterial coinfection was 2/142 (1.4%). None of the blood cultures showed pathogen growth while 6.3% was contaminated. The AUCs for predicting severe disease were 0.76 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.84), 0.70 (0.61 to 0.79), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.74), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.72) and 0.72 (0.63 to 0.81) for procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin, lymphocyte count and PSI score, respectively. Conclusion: Blood cultures appear to have limited value while procalcitonin and the PSI appear to be promising tools in helping physicians identify patients at risk for severe disease course in COVID-19 at presentation to the ED."
6945,Evaluation of the Cue Health point-of-care COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification) test at a community drive through collection center.,"Point-of-care (POC) tests are in high demand in order to facilitate rapid care decisions for patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a clinical validation study of the Cue Health POC nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) using the Cue lower nasal swab, compared to a reference NAAT using standard nasopharyngeal swab, in 292 symptomatic and asymptomatic outpatients for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a community drive through collection setting. Positive percent agreement between Cue COVID-19 and reference SARS-CoV-2 test was 91.7% (22 of 24); or 95.7% (22 of 23) when one patient with no tie-breaker method was excluded. Negative percent agreement was 98.4% (239 of 243), and there were 25 (8.6%) invalid or canceled results. The Cue COVID-19 test demonstrated very good positive and negative percent agreement with central laboratory tests and will be useful in settings where accurate POC testing is needed to facilitate management of patients suspected of COVID-19."
6946,Detection of R.1 lineage severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with spike protein W152L/E484K/G769V mutations in Japan.,"We aimed to investigate novel emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineages in Japan that harbor variants in the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). The total nucleic acid contents of samples from 159 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were subjected to whole genome sequencing. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from these patients were examined for variants in spike protein RBD. In January 2021, three family members (one aged in their 40s and two aged under 10 years old) were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 harboring W152L/E484K/G769V mutations. These three patients were living in Japan and had no history of traveling abroad. After identifying these cases, we developed a TaqMan assay to screen for the above hallmark mutations and identified an additional 14 patients with the same mutations. The associated virus strain was classified into the GR clade (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data [GISAID]), 20B clade (Nextstrain), and R.1 lineage (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak [PANGO] Lineages). As of April 22, 2021, R.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in 2,388 SARS-CoV-2 entries in the GISAID database, many of which were from Japan (38.2%; 913/2,388) and the United States (47.1%; 1,125/2,388). Compared with that in the United States, the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 isolates belonging to the R.1 lineage in Japan increased more rapidly over the period from October 24, 2020 to April 18, 2021. R.1 lineage SARS-CoV-2 has potential escape mutations in the spike protein RBD (E484K) and N-terminal domain (W152L); therefore, it will be necessary to continue to monitor the R.1 lineage as it spreads around the world."
6947,"[2019 Novel coronavirus, renin-angiotension system imbalance and coronavirus disease 2019].","2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) destroys angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and breaks the balance of renin-angiotension system (RAS) by interacting with ACE2. The imbalance of RAS takes part in the development of organ injury of different systems through pro-inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation and so on. 2019-nCoV not only attacks the lung, but also influences many other systems. It is speculated that RAS imbalance plays an important role in the development of multi-organ dysfunction caused by 2019-nCoV, and the usage of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) may become a new treatment of 2019-nCoV-related organ injury. Further studies are need to confirm the relationship between coronavirus infection, multi-organ injury and RAS imbalance."
6948,A case of gastrointestinal-predominant COVID-19 demonstrates value of stool PCR test.,"With over five million confirmed cases leading to over 165,000 deaths, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‚Äê19) has quickly made a large impact in the United States (US). COVID‚Äê19, which began as a viral outbreak in Wuhan City, China, was first detected in the US during January, 2020 (1). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
6949,Serological Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Naturally-Infected Mink and Other Experimentally-Infected Animals.,"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans from a yet unidentified animal reservoir and the capacity of the virus to naturally infect pets, farmed animals and potentially wild animals has highlighted the need for serological surveillance tools. In this study, the luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), employing the spike (S) and nucleocapsid proteins (N) of SARS-CoV-2, was used to examine the suitability of the assay for antibody detection in different animal species. Sera from SARS-CoV-2 naturally-infected mink (n = 77), SARS-CoV-2 experimentally-infected ferrets, fruit bats and hamsters and a rabbit vaccinated with a purified spike protein were examined for antibodies using the SARS-CoV-2 N and/or S proteins. From comparison with the known neutralization status of the serum samples, statistical analyses including calculation of the Spearman rank-order-correlation coefficient and Cohen's kappa agreement were used to interpret the antibody results and diagnostic performance. The LIPS immunoassay robustly detected the presence of viral antibodies in naturally infected SARS-CoV-2 mink, experimentally infected ferrets, fruit bats and hamsters as well as in an immunized rabbit. For the SARS-CoV-2-LIPS-S assay, there was a good level of discrimination between the positive and negative samples for each of the five species tested with 100% agreement with the virus neutralization results. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2-LIPS-N assay did not consistently differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative sera. This study demonstrates the suitability of the SARS-CoV-2-LIPS-S assay for the sero-surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a range of animal species."
