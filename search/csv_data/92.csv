910,COVID-19 antibody screening with SARS-CoV-2 red cell kodecytes using routine serologic diagnostic platforms.,"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a major global impact, and the resultant response in the development of new diagnostics is unprecedented. The detection of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a role in managing the pandemic. We evaluated the feasibility of using SARS-CoV-2 peptide Kode Technology-modified red cells (C19-kodecytes) to develop an assay compatible with existing routine serologic platforms. Study design and methods: A panel of eight unique red cells modified using Kode Technology function-spacer-lipid constructs and bearing short SARS-CoV-2 peptides was developed (C19-kodecyte assay). Kodecytes were tested against undiluted expected antibody-negative and -positive plasma samples in manual tube and three column agglutination technology (CAT) platforms. Parallel analysis with the same peptides in solid phase by enzyme immunoassays was performed. Evaluation samples included >120 expected negative blood donor samples and >140 COVID-19 convalescent plasma samples, with independent serologic analysis from two centers. Results: Specificity (negative reaction rate against expected negative samples) in three different CAT platforms against novel C19-kodecytes was >91%, which correlated with published literature. Sensitivity (positive reaction rate against expected positive convalescent, PCR-confirmed samples) ranged from 82% to 97% compared to 77% with the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Manual tube serology was less sensitive than CAT. Enzyme immunoassay results with some Kode Technology constructs also had high sensitivity. Conclusions: C19-kodecytes are viable for use as serologic reagent red cells for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody with routine blood antibody screening equipment."
911,Will SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern affect the promise of vaccines?,Initial optimism regarding the development of COVID-19 vaccines has been tempered by the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2. Will vaccination be able to contain the pandemic? How can we best optimize the limited supplies of vaccines available and what should future COVID-19 vaccines look like?
912,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva: implications for specimen transport and storage.,"Saliva has recently been proposed as a suitable specimen for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Use of saliva as a diagnostic specimen may present opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in remote and low-resource settings. Determining the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva over time is an important step in determining optimal storage and transport times. We undertook an in vitro study to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in contrived saliva samples. The contrived saliva samples comprised 10 ml pooled saliva spiked with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 to achieve a concentration of 2.58×104 copies ml SARS-CoV-2, which was subsequently divided into 2 ml aliquots comprising: (i) neat saliva; and a 1 : 1 dilution with (ii) normal saline; (iii) viral transport media, and (iv) liquid Amies medium. Contrived samples were made in quadruplicate, with two samples of each stored at either: (i) room temperature or (ii) 4 °C. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all SARS-CoV-2 spiked samples at time point 0, day 1, 3 and 7 at both storage temperatures using the N gene RT-PCR assay and time point 0, day 1 and day 7 using the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) RT-PCR assay. The ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva over a 1 week period is an important finding that presents further opportunities for saliva testing as a diagnostic specimen for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2."
913,Swab pooling: A new method for large-scale RT-qPCR screening of SARS-CoV-2 avoiding sample dilution.,"To minimize sample dilution effect on SARS-CoV-2 pool testing, we assessed analytical and diagnostic performance of a new methodology, namely swab pooling. In this method, swabs are pooled at the time of collection, as opposed to pooling of equal volumes from individually collected samples. Paired analysis of pooled and individual samples from 613 patients revealed 94 positive individuals. Having individual testing as reference, no false-positives or false-negatives were observed for swab pooling. In additional 18,922 patients screened with swab pooling (1,344 pools), mean Cq differences between individual and pool samples ranged from 0.1 (Cr.I. -0.98 to 1.17) to 2.09 (Cr.I. 1.24 to 2.94). Overall, 19,535 asymptomatic patients were screened using 4,400 RT-qPCR assays. This corresponds to an increase of 4.4 times in laboratory capacity and a reduction of 77% in required tests. Therefore, swab pooling represents a major alternative for reliable and large-scale screening of SARS-CoV-2 in low prevalence populations."
914,Understanding Individual SARS-CoV-2 Proteins for Targeted Drug Development against COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, responsible for millions of deaths globally. Even with effective vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 will likely maintain a hold in the human population through gaps in efficacy, percent vaccinated, and arising new strains. Therefore, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 causes widespread tissue damage and the development of targeted pharmacological treatments will be critical in fighting this virus and preparing for future outbreaks. Herein, we summarize the progress made thus far by using in vitro or in vivo models to investigate individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their pathogenic mechanisms. We have grouped the SARS-CoV-2 proteins into three categories: host entry, self-acting, and host interacting. This review focuses on the self-acting and host-interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins and summarizes current knowledge on how these proteins promote virus replication and disrupt host systems, as well as drugs that target the virus and virus interacting host proteins. Encouragingly, many of these drugs are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. Future coronavirus outbreaks will most likely be caused by new virus strains that evade vaccine protection through mutations in entry proteins. Therefore, study of individual self-acting and host-interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins for targeted therapeutic interventions is not only essential for fighting COVID-19 but also valuable against future coronavirus outbreaks."
915,Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunctions as a Clinical Manifestation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a Malaysian Tertiary Center.,"Objective: To investigate the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction among patients with COVID-19 infection and the recovery rate. Methods: Adult patients (≥18 years) tested positive for COVID-19 via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and admitted in Hospital Tuanku Ja'afar Seremban, Malaysia, were recruited in this study. Patients completed a questionnaire via telephone interview comprising the following details: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, general and otorhinolaryngological symptoms, onset and duration of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Patients with persistent olfactory and gustatory dysfunction at the time of the initial interview were followed-up every 3 to 5 days till resolution. Results: A total of 145 patients were included in our study. The mean age of patients was 43.0 ± 17.7 (range: 18-86). Fever (44.1%) and cough (39.3%) were the most prevalent general symptoms. Thirty-one patients (21.4%) reported olfactory dysfunction and 34 (23.4%) reported dysgeusia. There was a significant association between both olfactory and gustatory dysfunction (P < .001). Altered sense of smell or taste occurred before other symptoms in 7 (15.9%); concomitant in 16 (36.4%) and after in 15 (34.1%). Six patients (13.6%) reported isolated sudden-onset anosmia. The median duration of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions was 7 days. Complete recovery was achieved for 70.5% of the patients within 7 days of symptom onset. Only 6 (19.4%) of the 31 patients with olfactory dysfunction experienced nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Olfactory dysfunction was not significantly associated with nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Olfactory dysfunction was significantly associated with younger age (P = .002), female (P = .011), and hyperlipidemia (P = .012). Gustatory dysfunction was significantly associated with fever (P = .019) and cough (P = .039). Conclusion: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is a pertinent manifestation of COVID-19. Most of the affected patients achieve rapid and complete recovery. Sudden onset of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction should be recognized as a major symptom of COVID-19 as we implore to contain this pandemic."
916,SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: Comparison of three high-throughput immunoassays versus the neutralization test.,
917,Evaluation of 2 commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in an immunocompetent and immunocompromised inpatient population with COVID-19.,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread introduction of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was introduced without a full understanding of the assays performance or the antibody kinetics following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We performed an evaluation of 2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays with a more detailed look into the effect of immune status on antibody sensitivity. Results: Both assays demonstrated 100% specificity. The overall sensitivity of the Roche was 92.1% at ≥14 days and 94.8% at ≥21 days, and the overall sensitivity of the Abbott was 94.4% at ≥14 days and 98.2% at ≥21 days. 7/41 (17%) of patients included in this cohort were immunocompromised. Seroconversion was seen less commonly in the immunocompromised (4/7 [57.1%] seroconverted) and after excluding these patients 100% sensitivity was seen in both assays at ≥21 days. Discussion: Performance of both assays in the immunocompetent appeared excellent after 21 days postsymptom onset. Both assays are highly specific."
918,Contribution of VitaPCR SARS-CoV-2 to the emergency diagnosis of COVID-19.,"Background: With the persistent COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to use rapid and reliable diagnostic tools for highly urgent cases. Antigen tests are disappointing with their lack of sensitivity. Among molecular tools allowing a diagnosis in less than an hour, only one, the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, has exhibited a good sensitivity. However, we are also facing a global shortage of reagents and kits. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate other point-of-care molecular tests. Methods: We evaluated the VitaPCR™ RT-PCR assay, whose sample analysis time is of approximately 20 min, in nasopharyngeal secretions from 534 patients presenting to our Institute, for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and compared it to our routine RT-PCR assay. We also compared the two assays with tenfold dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 strain. Results: Compared to our routine RT-PCR and the previous diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of VitaPCR™ can be evaluated to be 99.3 % (155/156), 94.7 % (358/378), 88.6 % (155/175) and 99.7 % (358/359), respectively. Tenfold dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 strain show that the VitaPCR™ was more sensitive that our routine RT-PCR assay. Conclusion: The VitaPCR™ SARS-CoV-2 is an accurate rapid test, suitable for clinical practice that can be performed as part of a point-of-care testing, for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19."
919,Evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test: Potential to help reduce community spread?,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread from symptomatic patients with COVID-19, but also from asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, robust surveillance and timely interventions are essential for the control of virus spread within the community. In this regard the frequency of testing and speed of reporting, but not the test sensitivity alone, play a crucial role. Objectives: In order to reduce the costs and meet the expanding demands in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2, complementary assays, such as rapid antigen tests, have been developed. Rigorous analysis under varying conditions is required to assess the clinical performance of these tests and to ensure reproducible results. Results: We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a recently licensed rapid antigen test using 137 clinical samples in two institutions. Test sensitivity was between 88.2-89.6 % when applied to samples with viral loads typically seen in infectious patients. Of 32 rRT-PCR positive samples, 19 demonstrated infectivity in cell culture, and 84 % of these samples were reactive with the antigen test. Seven full-genome sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates and SARS-CoV-1 were detected with this antigen test, with no cross-reactivity against other common respiratory viruses. Conclusions: Numerous antigen tests are available for SARS-CoV-2 testing and their performance to detect infectious individuals may vary. Head-to-head comparison along with cell culture testing for infectivity may prove useful to identify better performing antigen tests. The antigen test analyzed in this study is easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scalable. It can be helpful in monitoring infection trends and thus has potential to reduce transmission."
