1520,Important Management Considerations In Patients With Pituitary Disorders During The Time Of The Covid-19 Pandemic.,"Objective: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that resulted in a global pandemic with substantial morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against COVID-19. The underlying associated comorbidity and diminished immune function of some pituitary patients (whether caused by the disease and its sequelae or treatment with excess glucocorticoids) increases their risk of contracting and developing complications from COVID-19 infection. Methods: A review of studies in PubMed and Google Scholar published between January 2020 to the time of writing (May 1, 2020) was conducted using the search terms 'pituitary,' 'coronavirus,' 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'diabetes mellitus', 'obesity', 'adrenal,' and 'endocrine.' Results: Older age and pre-existing obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus increase the risk of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. Men tend to be more severely affected than women; fortunately, most men, particularly of younger age, survive the infection. In addition to general comorbidities that may apply to many pituitary patients, they are also susceptible due to the following pituitary disorder-specific features: hypercortisolemia and adrenal suppression with Cushing disease, adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus with hypopituitarism, and sleep-apnea syndrome and chest wall deformity with acromegaly. Conclusion: This review aims to focus on the impact of COVID-19 in patients with pituitary disorders. As most countries are implementing mobility restrictions, we also discuss how this pandemic has affected patient attitudes and impacted our decision-making on management recommendations for these patients. Abbreviations: ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme; AI = adrenal insufficiency; ARB = angiotensin receptor blocker; ARDS = acute respiratory disease syndrome; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019; CPAP = continuous positive airway pressure; DI = diabetes insipidus; DM = diabetes mellitus; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2."

1522,"Progress of the COVID-19 vaccine effort: viruses, vaccines and variants versus efficacy, effectiveness and escape.","Where 2020 saw the development and testing of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at an unprecedented pace, the first half of 2021 has seen vaccine rollout in many countries. In this Progress article, we provide a snapshot of ongoing vaccine efficacy studies, as well as real-world data on vaccine effectiveness and the impact of virus variants of concern. Where they have been deployed in a high proportion of the adult population, the currently approved vaccines have been extremely effective in preventing COVID-19, particularly severe disease. Nonetheless, there are still significant challenges in ensuring equitable vaccine access around the globe and lessons that can be learned for controlling this pandemic and for the next pandemic."
1523,COVID-19: What Should the General Practitioner Know?,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently the most significant public health challenge. Its presentation ranges from mild to severe respiratory failure and septic shock. Rapid transmission of the virus is dangerous with a high possibility of life-threatening complications. Lack of treatment standards for SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current dilemma in clinical medicine. Methods: An electronic literature search was done using PubMed to gather information on the pathogenesis, transmission of infection, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for COVID-19. Search items included ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"" and ""coronavirus infection"". Results: In light of the current global crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2, the exchange of information within the scientific community should be quick and extremely transparent. Thus, this review presents the available information necessary for a general practitioner. Such presentation of data should allow the reader quick access to basic and crucial information related to epidemiology, viral transmission, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and complications that may occur in the course of COVID-19. Conclusion: Rapidly increasing amounts of information about the diagnosis and treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 allow a better understanding of the etiology and course of the infection. In the current epidemiological situation, readily accessible information helps minimize the time to acquire knowledge and focus on prevention methods, diagnostic and treatment options. Thus, this review highlights key issues related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and contains the most useful data for daily medical practice."
1524,Is the oral cavity a reservoir for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding?,"Limited knowledge about the contagiosity and case fatality rate of COVID-19 as well as the still enigmatic route of transmission have led to strict limitations of non-emergency health care especially in head and neck medicine and dentistry. There are theories that the oral cavity provides a favorable environment for SARS-CoV-2 entry and persistence which may be a risk for prolonged virus shedding. However, intraoral innate immune mechanisms provide antiviral effects against a myriad of pathogenic viruses. Initial hints of their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 are surfacing. It is hypothesized that intraoral immune system activity modulates the invasion pattern of SARS-CoV-2 into oral cells. Thus, the significance of intraoral tissues for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and persistence cannot be assessed. The underlying concept for this hypothesis was developed by the critical observation of a clinically asymptomatic COVID-19 patient. Despite a positive throat swab for SARS-CoV-2, molecular pathologic analysis of an oral perisulcular tissue specimen failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. More research effort is necessary to define the true origin of the contagiosity of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients."
1525,Large scale production and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 whole antigen for serological test development.,"Background: The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has generated a pandemic with alarming rates of fatality worldwide. This situation has had a major impact on clinical laboratories that have attempted to answer the urgent need for diagnostic tools, since the identification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Development of a reliable serological diagnostic immunoassay, with high levels of sensitivity and specificity to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with improved differential diagnosis from other circulating viruses, is mandatory. Methods: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using whole inactivated virus cultured in vitro, was developed to detect viral antigens. WB and ELISA investigations were carried out with sera of convalescent patients and negative sera samples. Both analyses were concurrently performed with recombinant MABs to verify the findings. Results: Preliminary data from 10 sera (5 patients with COVID-19, and 5 healthy controls) using this immunoassay are very promising, successfully identifying all of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. Conclusion: This ELISA appears to be a specific and reliable method for detecting COVID-19 antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA), and a useful tool for identifying individuals which have developed immunity to the virus."
1526,"COVID-19 vaccines and herd immunity: Perspectives, challenges and prospects.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the biggest public health threats in the 21st century. Nearly every country in the world has been affected by COVID-19. The magnitude of the problem, with over 179 million confirmed cases and 3.8 million deaths worldwide, has driven researchers to search for vaccines to combat the disease. The discovery and development of a new vaccine, from the initial stage to the vaccine finally reaching the patients, usually take many years. However, given the urgency of the situation, many clinical trials on the COVID-19 vaccines have been conducted at extraordinary speed, whereas several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being administered worldwide. This article gives an overview of the different types of COVID-19 vaccines, with a focus on those with promising results and are commonly used worldwide. It also gives an overview of herd immunity and discusses the challenges in achieving herd immunity through the global vaccination campaigns. Last but not least, some strategies that may be used to address these challenges are discussed."
1527,The impact of high-resolution structural data on stemming the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on human health and the world economy. The response of the scientific community was unparalleled, and a combined global effort has resulted in the creation of vaccines in a shorter time frame than previously unimaginable. Reflecting this concerted effort, the structural analysis of the etiological agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has progressed with an unprecedented pace. Since the onset of the pandemic, over 1000 high-resolution structures of a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been solved and made publicly available. These structures have aided in the identification of numerous potential druggable targets and have contributed to the design of different vaccine candidates. This opinion article will discuss the impact of high-resolution structures in understanding SARS-CoV-2 biology and explore their role in the development of vaccines and antivirals."
1528,A sensitive and affordable multiplex RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection.,"With the ongoing COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), there is a need for sensitive, specific, and affordable diagnostic tests to identify infected individuals, not all of whom are symptomatic. The most sensitive test involves the detection of viral RNA using RT-qPCR (quantitative reverse transcription PCR), with many commercial kits now available for this purpose. However, these are expensive, and supply of such kits in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed a multiplex assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets alongside a human cellular control (RPP30) and a viral spike-in control (Phocine Herpes Virus 1 [PhHV-1]), which monitor sample quality and nucleic acid extraction efficiency, respectively. Here, we establish that this test performs as well as widely used commercial assays, but at substantially reduced cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate >1,000-fold variability in material routinely collected by combined nose and throat swabbing and establish a statistically significant correlation between the detected level of human and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. The inclusion of the human control probe in our assay therefore provides a quantitative measure of sample quality that could help reduce false-negative rates. We demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a robust RT-qPCR assay at approximately 10% of the cost of equivalent commercial assays, which could benefit low-resource environments and make high-volume testing affordable."
