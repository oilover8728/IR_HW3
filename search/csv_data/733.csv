7320,"Current perspective on diagnosis, epidemiological assessment, prevention strategies, and potential therapeutic interventions for severe acute respiratory infections caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).","Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe respiratory, enteric, and systemic infections in a vast range of hosts, including man, fish, mammals, and avian. Scientific interest has heightened on coronaviruses after the emergence of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This review provides current perspectives on morphology, genetic diversity, transmission characteristics, replication cycle, diagnostic approaches, epidemiological assessment, and prevention strategies against the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, different potential biotherapeutics such as small drug molecules, different vaccines, and immunotherapies to control severe acute respiratory infections caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are repurposed and discussed with different mechanistic approaches. The current growth trends of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 outbreak globally and preventive measures are briefly discussed. Furthermore, the lessons learned from the COVID-19 outbreak, so far, concluding remarks and future directions for controlling for COVID-19, are also recommended for a safer tomorrow."
7321,The real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction threshold cycle values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 predict the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia.,"The clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) varies from mild to critical. We retrospectively examined whether clinical and laboratory findings on admission could predict COVID-19 prognosis. Among various factors associated with COVID-19 severity, our results indicated that the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) threshold cycle (Ct) values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were the most useful predictor of COVID-19 prognosis."
7322,In-silico nucleotide and protein analyses of S-gene region in selected zoonotic coronaviruses reveal conserved domains and evolutionary emergence with trajectory course of viral entry from SARS-CoV-2 genomic data.,"Introduction: the recent zoonotic coronavirus virus outbreak of a novel type (COVID-19) has necessitated the adequate understanding of the evolutionary pathway of zoonotic viruses which adversely affects human populations for therapeutic constructs to combat the pandemic now and in the future. Methods: we analyzed conserved domains of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for possible targets of viral entry inhibition in host cells, evolutionary relationship of human coronavirus (229E) and zoonotic coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2 as well as evolutionary relationship between selected SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. Results: conserved domains with antagonistic action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc. Also, multiple sequence alignments of the spike (S) gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic coronaviruses alongside the S gene protein of the SARS-CoV-2 revealed closest evolutionary relationship (95.6%) with pangolin coronaviruses (S) gene. Clades formed between Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry trajectory while revealing genomic and protein SARS-CoV-2 data from Philippines as early ancestors. Conclusion: phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data suggests profiling in diverse populations with and without the outbreak alongside migration history and racial background for mutation tracking and dating of viral subtype divergence which is essential for effective management of present and future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks."
7323,Surveillance-based informative testing for detection and containment of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on a public university campus: an observational and modelling study.,"Background: Despite severe outbreaks of COVID-19 among colleges and universities across the USA during the Fall 2020 semester, the majority of institutions did not routinely test students. While high-frequency repeated testing is considered the most effective strategy for disease mitigation, most institutions do not have the necessary infrastructure or funding for implementation. Therefore, alternative strategies for testing the student population are needed. Our study detailed the implementation and results of testing strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread on a university campus, and we aimed to assess the relative effectiveness of the different testing strategies. Methods: For this retrospective cohort study, we included 6273 on-campus students arriving to a large public university in the rural USA (Clemson, SC, USA) for in-person instruction in the Fall 2020 semester (Sept 21 to Nov 25). Individuals arriving after Sept 23, those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before Aug 19, and student athletes and band members were not included in this study. We implemented two testing strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread during this period: a novel surveillance-based informative testing (SBIT) strategy, consisting of random surveillance testing to identify outbreaks in residence hall buildings or floors and target them for follow-up testing (Sept 23 to Oct 5); followed by a repeated weekly surveillance testing (Oct 6 to Nov 22). Relative changes in estimated weekly prevalence were examined. We developed SARS-CoV-2 transmission models to compare the relative effectiveness of weekly testing (900 daily surveillance tests), SBIT (450 daily surveillance tests), random surveillance testing (450 daily surveillance tests), and voluntary testing (0 daily surveillance tests) on disease mitigation. Model parameters were based on our empirical surveillance data in conjunction with published sources. Findings: SBIT was implemented from Sept 23 to Oct 5, and identified outbreaks in eight residence hall buildings and 45 residence hall floors. Targeted testing of residence halls was 2·03 times more likely to detect a positive case than random testing (95% CI 1·67-2·46). Weekly prevalence was reduced from a peak of 8·7% to 5·6% during this 2-week period, a relative reduction of 36% (95% CI 27-44). Prevalence continued to decrease after implementation of weekly testing, reaching 0·8% at the end of in-person instruction (week 9). SARS-CoV-2 transmission models concluded that, in the absence of SBIT (ie, voluntary testing only), the total number of COVID-19 cases would have increased by 154% throughout the semester. Compared with SBIT, random surveillance testing alone would have resulted in a 24% increase in COVID-19 cases. Implementation of weekly testing at the start of the semester would have resulted in 36% fewer COVID-19 cases throughout the semester compared with SBIT, but it would require twice the number of daily tests. Interpretation: It is imperative that institutions rigorously test students during the 2021 academic year. When high-frequency testing (eg, weekly) is not possible, SBIT is an effective strategy to mitigate disease spread among the student population that can be feasibly implemented across colleges and universities.

7324,Safety Considerations in the Laboratory Testing of Specimens Suspected or Known to Contain the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,
7325,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Infants Less than 90 Days Old.,This is a single-center US case series of 18 infants <90 days old who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These infants had a mild febrile illness without significant pulmonary disease. One-half of the infants were hospitalized; 1 had bacterial urinary tract co-infection. Nasopharyngeal viral loads were notably high. Latinx ethnicity was overrepresented.
7326,What We Need to Consider During and After the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic.,"Even though extreme containment and mitigation strategies were implemented by numerous governments around the world to slow down the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the number of critically ill patients and fatalities keeps rising. This crisis has highlighted the socioeconomic disparities of health care systems within and among countries. As new CoVID policies and responses are implemented to lessen the impact of the virus, it is imperative (1) to consider additional mitigation strategies critical for the development of effective countermeasures, (2) to promote long-term policies and strict regulations of the trade of wildlife and live animal markets, and (3) to advocate for necessary funding and investments in global health, specifically for the prevention of and response to natural and manmade pandemics. This document considers some of these challenges."
7327,"SARS-CoV-2: previous coronaviruses, immune response, and development of vaccines.","Since the emergence of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019, when its characteristics were practically unknown, one aspect was evident: its high contagion rate. This high infection rate resulted in the spread of the virus in China, Europe, and, eventually, the rest of the world, including Mexico. At present, around 9 million people are infected, and around 470,000 have died worldwide. In this context, the need to generate protective immunity, and especially the generation of a vaccine that can protect the world population against infection in the shortest possible time, is a challenge that is being addressed in different countries using different strategies in multiple clinical trials. This opinion article will present the evidence of the induction of immune response in some of the viruses of the coronavirus family before COVID-19, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). The information collected about the induction of an immune response by SARS-CoV-2 will be presented, as well as a description of the vaccine candidates reported to date in the various ongoing clinical trials. Finally, an opinion based on the evidence presented will be issued on the potential success of developing vaccine prototypes."
7328,Systematic screening for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women admitted for delivery in a Portuguese maternity.,"Objectives The burden of undocumented SARS-Cov-2 infections in Portuguese pregnant women is unknown. At our institution, routine COVID-19 testing was implemented from 19th of March on to all pregnant women who were admitted for delivery. The purpose of the study was to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in our obstetric population admitted for delivery. Mathods Between 19th March and May 4th, 184 pregnant women were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection upon admission. Results Eleven women were positive for SARS-CoV-2, corresponding to a global prevalence of 6.0%. Of these, only two reported symptoms at admission. The prevalence of asymptomatic infection was 4.9%. We report a lower rate of positive cass than other studies. Eighty-two percent of our cases had no symptoms at admission. Conclusions The proportion of asymptomatic infection highlights the importance of universal laboratory screening for all women admitted for delivery as opposed to symptom-based screening."
7329,Diagnostic role of chest computed tomography in coronavirus disease 2019.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), that appeared in China in December 2019 and spread globally, evolving into the currently observed pandemic. The laboratory diagnosis of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection is currently based on real‑time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) testing, and imaging cannot replace genetic testing in patients with suspected COVID‑19. However, with predominant respiratory manifestations of COVID‑19, particularly in more severe cases, chest imaging using computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in detecting viral lung infection, evaluating the nature and extent of pulmonary lesions, and monitoring the disease activity. The role of chest CT as a diagnostic tool may be increased when the laboratory testing capacities using RT‑PCR prove inaccurate or insufficient during a major outbreak of the disease. In these settings, a rapid presumptive diagnosis of COVID‑19 potentially offered by CT might be an advantage, in addition to obvious benefits of delineating the nature and extent of pulmonary lesions. In the present paper, we reviewed the diagnostic role of chest CT in patients with COVID‑19."
