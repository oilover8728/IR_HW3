6790,Profile of Immunoglobulin G and IgM Antibodies Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"We profiled the serological responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein and spike (S) glycoprotein. The majority of the patients developed robust antibody responses between 17 and 23 days after illness onset. Delayed, but stronger, antibody responses were observed in critical patients."
6791,A Japanese case of COVID-19: An autopsy report.,"A 93-year-old woman was admitted with a 10-day history of cough and prostration. Thoracic computed tomography revealed extensive ground-glass opacities in both the lungs. The polymerase chain reaction test of sputum for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was positive. She was treated with antiviral agents and steroid pulse therapy. However, her oxygen saturation gradually declined, and she died 10 days after hospitalization. The most important autopsy finding was fuzzily segmented diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) that expanded from the subpleural to the medial area. No remarkable changes were observed in organs other than the lungs. Therefore, pneumocytes were suggested as the primary target for SARS-CoV-2, which might explain why coronavirus infectious disease-19 is a serious condition. Thus, early treatment is essential to prevent viral replication from reaching a level that triggers DAD."
6792,Arginine depletion as a therapeutic approach for patients with COVID-19.,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a source of significant morbidity and death worldwide, and effective treatments are urgently needed. Clinical trials have focused largely on direct antiviral therapies or on immunomodulation in patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. One therapeutic approach that remains to be clinically investigated is disruption of the host-virus relationship through amino acid restriction, a strategy used successfully in the setting of cancer treatment. Arginine is an amino acid that has been shown in nonclinical studies to be essential in the life cycle of many viruses. Therefore, arginine depletion may be an effective therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2. Several arginine-metabolizing enzymes in clinical development may be a viable approach to induce a low arginine environment to treat COVID-19 and other viral diseases. Herein, we explore the rationale for arginine depletion as a therapeutic approach for COVID-19."
6793,Are COVID-19 vaccines safe in pregnancy?,"As the COVID-19 vaccination programme starts to be rolled out, many young women are hesitant to accept the vaccine, citing concerns about fertility. Meanwhile, those offered the vaccine during pregnancy must decide whether they will accept, even though pregnant people were excluded from the clinical trials. Data on accidental pregnancies that occurred during the trials and, increasingly, outcomes in pregnant people who receive the vaccine can help these groups to make informed decisions."

6795,Disease activity and humoral response in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases after two doses of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: The registration trials of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 did not address patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD). Objective: To assess the humoral response after two doses of mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, in patients with IRD treated with immunomodulating drugs and the impact on IRD activity. Methods: Consecutive patients treated at the rheumatology institute, who received their first SARS-CoV-2 (Pfizer) vaccine, were recruited to the study, at their routine visit. They were reassessed 4-6 weeks after receiving the second dose of vaccine, and blood samples were obtained for serology. IRD activity assessment and the vaccine side effects were documented during both visits. IgG antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott) assay. Results: Two hundred and sixty-four patients with stable disease, (mean(SD) age 57.6 (13.18) years, disease duration 11.06 (7.42) years), were recruited. The immunomodulatory therapy was not modified before or after the vaccination. After the second vaccination, 227 patients (86%) mounted IgG Ab against SARS-CoV-2 (mean (SD) 5830.8 (8937) AU/mL) and 37 patients (14%) did not, 22/37 were treated with B cell-depleting agents. The reported side effects of the vaccine were minor. The rheumatic disease remained stable in all patients. Conclusions: The vast majority of patients with IRD developed a significant humoral response following the administration of the second dose of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Only minor side effects were reported and no apparent impact on IRD activity was noted."
6796,Inverted repeats in coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome manifest the evolution events.,"The world faces a great unforeseen challenge through the COVID-19 pandemic caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The virus genome structure and evolution are positioned front and center for further understanding insights on vaccine development, monitoring of transmission trajectories, and prevention of zoonotic infections of new coronaviruses. Of particular interest are genomic elements Inverse Repeats (IRs), which maintain genome stability, regulate gene expressions, and are the targets of mutations. However, little research attention is given to the IR content analysis in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In this study, we propose a geometric analysis method and using the method to investigate the distributions of IRs in SARS-CoV-2 and its related coronavirus genomes. The method represents each genomic IR sequence pair as a single point and constructs the geometric shape of the genome using the IRs. Thus, the IR shape can be considered as the signature of the genome. The genomes of different coronaviruses are then compared using the constructed IR shapes. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 genome, specifically, has an abundance of IRs, and the IRs in coronavirus genomes show an increase during evolution events."
6797,"Health care workers intention to accept COVID-19 vaccine and associated factors in southwestern Ethiopia, 2021.","Introduction: Health care workers are the most affected part of the world population due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries prioritize vaccinating health workers against COVID-19 because of their susceptibility to the virus. However, the acceptability of the vaccine varies across populations. Thus, this study aimed to determine the health care worker's intentions to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and its associated factors in southwestern Ethiopia, 2021. Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers in public hospitals in southwestern Ethiopia from March 15 to 28, 2021. A simple random sampling method was used to select 405 participants from each hospital. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, such as frequency and percentage, were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was also performed to identify factors associated with health care worker's intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Statistically significant variables were selected based on p-values (<0.05) and the adjusted odds ratio was used to describe the strength of association with 95% confidence intervals. Result: Among the respondents, 48.4% [95% CI: 38.6, 58.2] of health care workers intended to accept COVID-19. Intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination was significantly associated with physicians (AOR = 9.27, 95% CI: 1.27-27.32), professionals with a history of chronic illness (AOR = 4.07, 95% CI: 2.02-8.21), perceived degree of risk of COVID-19 infection (AOR = 4.63, 95% CI: 1.26-16.98), positive attitude toward COVID-19 prevention (AOR = 6.08, 95% CI: 3.39-10.91) and good preventive practices (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.58-5.08). Conclusion: In this study, the intention of health care workers to accept the COVID-19 vaccine was low. Professional types, history of chronic illness, perceived degree of risk to COVID-19 infection, attitude toward COVID-19 and preventive practices were found to be factors for intention to accept COVID-19 vaccine in professionals. It is important to consider professional types, history of chronic illness, perceived degree of risk to COVID-19, attitude of professionals and preventive behaviors to improve the intention of professionals' vaccine acceptance."
6798,Clinical Evaluation and Utilization of Multiple Molecular In Vitro Diagnostic Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"Objectives: To evaluate the clinical performance of 3 molecular assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: We used 184 nasopharyngeal swab specimens to compare Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 (Abbott ID NOW), DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (DiaSorin Simplexa), and Roche cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 (Roche cobas) assays. In a separate analysis, 3 specimens (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and nasal) were collected from 182 unique patients presenting to the emergency department with suspicion of coronavirus disease 2019 and were tested utilizing Abbott ID NOW. To further characterize each assay, relative limits of detection were evaluated utilizing positive nasopharyngeal patient samples. Results: The positive percent agreement was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.97) for Abbott ID NOW and 100% (95% CI, 0.90-1.00) for DiaSorin Simplexa and Roche cobas. The negative percent agreement was 100% (95% CI, 0.98-1.00) for all 3 assays. All swab types tested with the Abbott assay produced concordant results. Polymerase chain reaction assays had approximately 10 to 100 times lower limits of detection than Abbott ID NOW. Conclusions: Based on these evaluations, a multiplatform testing approach is proposed, depending on patient population and assay sensitivity, to address testing needs during a public health emergency."
6799,Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions targeted at COVID-19 pandemic on influenza burden - a systematic review.,"Objectives: To better understand the impact of comprehensive COVID-19 targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on influenza burden worldwide. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in selected databases (PubMed, WHO COVID-19), preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv) and websites of European Public Health institutes. Documents that compared influenza estimates in the 2019/2020 season with previous seasons were included. Information synthesis was qualitative due to a high heterogeneity in the number and periods of comparative seasons, outcome measures and statistical methods. Results: We included 23 records reporting from 15 countries/regions as well as 8 reports from European Public Health agencies. Estimates in the 2019/2020 season based on influenza virus tests (4 out of 7 countries/regions), defined influenza cases (8 out of 9), influenza positivity rate (7 out of 8), and severe complications (1 out of 2) were lower than in former seasons. Results from syndromic indicators, such as influenza-like-illness (ILI), were less clear or even raised (4 out of 7) after the influenza season indicating a misclassification with COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Evidence synthesis suggests that NPIs targeted at SARS-CoV-2-transmission reduce influenza burden as well. Low threshold NPIs need to be more strongly emphasized in influenza prevention strategies."
