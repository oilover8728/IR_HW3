1342,Current understanding on molecular drug targets and emerging treatment strategy for novel coronavirus-19.,"SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, contain crown-like spikes on its surface, exceptional of large RNA genome, and a special replication machinery. Common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 include cough, common cold, fever, sore throat, and a variety of severe acute respiratory disease (SARD) such as pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells, T-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and also influences the production and implantation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Repurposing of various drugs during this emergency condition can reduce the rate of mortality as well as time and cost. Two druggable protein and enzyme targets have been selected in this review article due to their crucial role in the viral life cycle. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4A), cyclophilin, nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) play significant role in early and late phase of SARS-CoV-2 replication and translation. This review paper is based on the rationale of inhibiting of various SARS-CoV-2 proteins and enzymes as novel therapeutic approaches for the management and treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discussed the structural and functional relationship of different proteins and enzymes to develop therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2."
1343,Comparison of five SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection tests in a hospital setting and performance of one antigen assay in routine practice: a useful tool to guide isolation precautions?,"Background: In a hospital setting, there is a need for rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to guide isolation measures and targeted admission. Aim: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of five SARS-CoV-2 rapid nucleocapsid protein antigen detection (RAD) assays (Biosynex, Biotical, Orient Gene, Panbio and SD Biosensor), and describe the performance and impact of implementation of the SD Biosensor assay in an emergency department. Methods: Sensitivity and specificity of the five RAD assays were analysed on 100 respiratory samples: 60 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, 24 SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative samples and 16 samples positive for other respiratory pathogens. The manufacturer's protocol was adapted to validate the antigen tests on transport media used for rRT-PCR in the authors' routine practice. The SD Biosensor RAD assay was implemented as a screening method for rapid diagnosis and targeted admission. Findings: Sensitivity of the five RAD assays ranged from 88.9% to 100% for samples with cycle threshold values <26, and specificity ranged from 46.2% to 100%. During the implementation period, 4195 RAD tests were performed. Due to the rapid RAD result, 157 patients were transferred directly to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cohort ward instead of the regular ward (N=47) or the temporary COVID-19 ward (N=110). Conclusion: The SD Biosensor, Biotical and Panbio SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests showed acceptable overall performance, and identified the majority of contagious patients. In the context of high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, RAD tests can be used as a rapid screening tool to guide infection prevention measures and aid targeted admission."
1344,Evaluation of Dried Blood Spot Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Serology Using a Quantitative Commercial Assay.,"Dried blood spots (DBS) are commonly used for serologic testing for viruses and provide an alternative collection method when phlebotomy and/or conventional laboratory testing are not readily available. DBS collection could be used to facilitate widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to document past infection, vaccination, and potentially immunity. We investigated the characteristics of Roche's Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S) assay, a quantitative commercial assay for antibodies against the spike glycoprotein. Antibody levels were reduced relative to plasma following elution from DBS. Quantitative results from DBS samples were highly correlated with values from plasma (r2 = 0.98), allowing for extrapolation using DBS results to accurately estimate plasma antibody levels. High concordance between plasma and fingerpick DBS was observed in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients tested 90 days or more after the diagnosis (45/46 matched; 1/46 mismatched plasma vs. DBS). The assessment of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 using DBS may be feasible using a quantitative anti-S assay, although false negatives may rarely occur in those with very low antibody levels."
1345,"A Community-Adapted Approach to SARS-CoV-2 Testing for Medically Underserved Populations, Rhode Island, USA.","We developed a testing program for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in an urban Latinx neighborhood in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. Approximately 11% of Latinx participants (n = 180) tested positive. Culturally tailored, community-based programs that reduce barriers to testing help identify persons at highest risk for coronavirus disease."

1347,Routine Hospital-based SARS-CoV-2 Testing Outperforms State-based Data in Predicting Clinical Burden.,"Throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, government policy and healthcare implementation responses have been guided by reported positivity rates and counts of positive cases in the community. The selection bias of these data calls into question their validity as measures of the actual viral incidence in the community and as predictors of clinical burden. In the absence of any successful public or academic campaign for comprehensive or random testing, we have developed a proxy method for synthetic random sampling, based on viral RNA testing of patients who present for elective procedures within a hospital system. We present here an approach under multilevel regression and poststratification to collecting and analyzing data on viral exposure among patients in a hospital system and performing statistical adjustment that has been made publicly available to estimate true viral incidence and trends in the community. We apply our approach to tracking viral behavior in a mixed urban-suburban-rural setting in Indiana. This method can be easily implemented in a wide variety of hospital settings. Finally, we provide evidence that this model predicts the clinical burden of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) earlier and more accurately than currently accepted metrics.

1348,Performance evaluation of antibody-based point-of-care devices intended for the identification of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.,"The novel coronavirus outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China. The local outbreak quickly rose to pandemic level that has spread to more than 188 countries with more than 19 million cases and 732,467 deaths worldwide. The current recommendation for testing is RT-PCR based tests of nasopharyngeal or alternatively nasal- and/or oropharyngeal swabs that detects infection with SARS-CoV-2 to diagnose acute infection. However, there is an urgent need for a quick and accurate antibody-based point-of-care test method to quickly identify evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people who might be missed through active case finding and surveillance efforts. Serology tests measure the presence of antibodies in serum after infection. Here we compared the performance characteristics of 6 commercially available antibody-based point-of-care devices and their potential for identification of individuals infected at some time by SARS-CoV-2."
1349,COVID-19 new diagnostics development: novel detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 infection and considerations for their translation to routine use.,"Purpose of review: COVID-19 has put the in-vitro-diagnostic community under an unprecedented spotlight, with a global requirement for accurate SARS-CoV-2 tests. This review will outline technological responses to this need and the analytical considerations required for their translation to routine use. Recent findings: SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic solutions directly detect the virus or measure host-derived surrogate markers of infection. With pressure upon supply chains for the 'traditional' molecular approaches, a wide variety of analytical tools spanning the molecular, serology, imaging and chemistry space are being developed, including high throughput solutions and simplified near-patient formats. Summary: The unique genetic nature of SARS-CoV-2 means high analytical specificity is achievable by most diagnostic formats. However, clinical sensitivity assessment is complicated by wide discrepancies in analytical range and challenges associated with standardising these differences. When coupled with the acute nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported precise metrics of test performance must be questioned. The response to SARS-CoV-2 has delivered considerable diagnostic innovation, but for a technology to be maximised, it must be demonstrably reproducible and fit for purpose. If novel diagnostic solutions for SARS-CoV-2 are to succeed, equally innovative mechanisms are needed to ensure widespread clinical and surveillance application, enabling agreed standards and metrics to ensure comparability."
