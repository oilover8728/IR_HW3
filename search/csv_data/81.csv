801,Laboratory Diagnosis of COVID-19: Current Issues and Challenges.,"The COVID-19 outbreak has had a major impact on clinical microbiology laboratories in the past several months. This commentary covers current issues and challenges for the laboratory diagnosis of infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the preanalytical stage, collecting the proper respiratory tract specimen at the right time from the right anatomic site is essential for a prompt and accurate molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. Appropriate measures are required to keep laboratory staff safe while producing reliable test results. In the analytic stage, real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays remain the molecular test of choice for the etiologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection while antibody-based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools. In the postanalytical stage, testing results should be carefully interpreted using both molecular and serological findings. Finally, random-access, integrated devices available at the point of care with scalable capacities will facilitate the rapid and accurate diagnosis and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections and greatly assist in the control of this outbreak."
802,Durability of antibody response to vaccination and surrogate neutralization of emerging variants based on SARS-CoV-2 exposure history.,"Two-dose messenger RNA vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection. However, the durability of protection is not known, nor is the effectiveness against emerging viral variants. Additionally, vaccine responses may differ based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure history. To investigate protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants we measured binding and neutralizing antibody responses following both vaccine doses. We document significant declines in antibody levels three months post-vaccination, and reduced neutralization of emerging variants, highlighting the need to identify correlates of clinical protection to inform the timing of and indications for booster vaccination."
803,"COVID-19: Unmasking Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants, Vaccines and Therapeutic Strategies.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has been a topic of major concern for global human health. The challenge to restrain the COVID-19 pandemic is further compounded by the emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants viz. B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), which show increased transmissibility and resistance towards vaccines and therapies. Importantly, there is convincing evidence of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals with dysregulated immune response and comorbidities. Herein, we provide a comprehensive perspective regarding vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with underlying medical comorbidities. We discuss ongoing vaccine (mRNA, protein-based, viral vector-based, etc.) and therapeutic (monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, plasma therapy, etc.) modalities designed to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss in detail, the challenges posed by different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) identified across the globe and their effects on therapeutic and prophylactic interventions."
804,The Additional Contribution of Second Nasopharyngeal PCR to COVID-19 Diagnosis in Patients with Negative Initial Test.,"Objective: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends performing a second test in patients with a high suspicion of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) whose first PCR test is negative. However, the additional contribution of the second PCR test to the diagnosis is unknown. Patients and methods: In this study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of second SARS-CoV-2 PCR to diagnosis in patients with a suspicion of COVID-19 whose initial test was negative. Results: A total of 1449 patients were hospitalized in infectious disease clinics with the suspicion of COVID-19 infection during the study period. We performed the second PCR test (697 nasopharyngeal sample, 5 tracheal aspirate) in 702/766 (91.6%) patients whose first tests were negative and detected as positive in only 6.6% (46) of samples. Conclusions: The strategy of using the second nasopharyngeal PCR test to confirm or exclude the diagnosis seems to cause the loss of labor and time, and is costly, because its additional contribution to the first test is very low."
805,"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Mitigation Efforts among Office Workers, Washington, DC, USA.","Despite mitigation efforts, 2 coronavirus disease outbreaks were identified among office workers in Washington, DC. Moderate adherence to workplace mitigation efforts was reported in a serologic survey; activities outside of the workplace were associated with infection. Adherence to safety measures are critical for returning to work during the pandemic."
806,Comparison and Sensitivity Evaluation of Three Different Commercial Real-Time Quantitative PCR Kits for SARS-CoV-2 Detection.,"Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most sensitive and specific assay and, therefore, is the ""gold standard"" diagnostic method for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to compare and analyze the detection performance of three different commercially available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kits: Sansure Biotech, GeneFinderTM, and TaqPathTM on 354 randomly selected samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. All PCR reactions were performed using the same RNA isolates and one real-time PCR machine. The final result of the three evaluated kits was not statistically different (p = 0.107), and also had a strong positive association and high Cohen's Îº coefficient. In contrast, the average Ct values that refer to the ORF1ab and N gene amplification were significantly different (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), with the lowest obtained by the TaqPathTM for the ORF1ab and by the Sansure Biotech for the N gene. The results show a high similarity in the analytical sensitivities for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which indicates that the diagnostic accuracy of the three assays is comparable. However, the SanSure Biotech kit showed a bit better diagnostic performance. Our findings suggest that the imperative for improvement should address the determination of cut-off Ct values and rapid modification of the primer sets along with the appearance of new variants."
807,Early and consecutive RT-PCR tests with both oropharyngeal swabs and sputum could improve testing yield for patients with COVID-19: An observation cohort study in China.,"Objective: The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and provides a powerful tool to identify new infections and facilitate contact tracing. In fact, as the prevalence of COVID-19 decreases, this RT-PCR testing remains as the main preventive measure to avoid rebound. However, inconsistent results can lead to misdiagnoses in the clinic. These inconsistencies are due to the variability in (1) the collection times of biological samples post infection, and (2) sampling procedures. Methods: We applied the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate logistic regression on RT-PCR results from 258 confirmed patients with COVID-19 to evaluate the factors associated with negative conversion. We also estimated the proportion (%) of negative conversion among patients who had tested twice or more, and compared the proportions arising from oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, and combined double testing, respectively. Main results: The proportion of negative conversion was 6.7% on day 4, 16.4% on day 7, 41.0% at 2 weeks, and 61.0% at 3 weeks post-admission. We also found that 34.1% and 60.3% of subjects had at least one negative RT-PCR result on days 7 and 14 after the onset of symptoms, respectively. The proportion of negative conversions following sputum testing was higher than that from oropharyngeal swabs in the early stages but this declined after the onset of symptoms. Conclusion: In the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, efficient testing strategies are critical if we are to control the COVID-19 epidemic. According to this study, early, consecutive and combined double testing, will be the key to identify infected patients, particularly for asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases. These strategies will minimize misdiagnosis and the ineffective isolation of infected patients."
808,High-resolution melting curve FRET-PCR rapidly identifies SARS-CoV-2 mutations.,"Reverse transcription fluorescence resonance energy transfer-polymerase chain reaction (FRET-PCRs) were designed against the two most common mutations in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (A23403G in the spike protein; C14408T in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). Based on high-resolution melting curve analysis, the reverse transcription (RT) FRET-PCRs identified the mutations in american type culture collection control viruses, and feline and human clinical samples. All major makes of PCR machines can perform melting curve analysis and thus further specifically designed FRET-PCRs could enable active surveillance for mutations and variants in countries where genome sequencing is not readily available."
809,Imported SARS-CoV-2 Variant P.1 in Traveler Returning from Brazil to Italy.,We report an imported case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant P.1 detected in an asymptomatic traveler who arrived in Italy on an indirect flight from Brazil. This case shows the risk for introduction of SARS-CoV-2 variants from indirect flights and the need for continued SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.
