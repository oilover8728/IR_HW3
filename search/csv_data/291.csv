2901,COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented global societal and economic disruptive impact highlight the urgent need for safe and effective vaccines. Taking substantial advantages of versatility and rapid development, two mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 have completed late-stage clinical assessment at an unprecedented speed and reported positive results. In this review, we outline keynotes in mRNA vaccine development, discuss recently published data on COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidates, focusing on those in clinical trials and analyze future potential challenges."

2903,A recommended paradigm for vaccination of rheumatic disease patients with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.,"Autoimmune and autoinflammatory rheumatic disorders (ARD) are treated with antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors and biologic agents either neutralizing cytokines [Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-17, B-cell activating factor] or being directed against B-cells (anti-CD-20), costimulatory molecules or JAK kinases. Similarly for the influenza or pneumococcal vaccines, there is limited data on the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 prevention for this susceptible patient population. Moreover, preliminary data from vaccinated organ transplanted, inflammatory bowel and connective tissue disease patients suggests only limited immunogenicity after the first vaccine dose, particularly in patients on immunosuppressive regimens. Herein a set of recommendations for the vaccination of immune suppressed patients with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is proposed aimed at achieving optimal vaccine benefit without interfering with disease activity status. Moreover, rare autoimmune adverse events related to vaccinations are discussed."

2905,Double standards redux.,"It is fair to say that nothing is more pressing in today's world than bringing an end to the Covid-19 pandemic. Or to be more precise, if not an end, then the quickest and most effective reduction of mortality and morbidity from the disease in every country where infections exist. The forthcoming theme issue of IJME explores a long-standing ethical concern in research with human beings, focused mainly on a question posed about vaccine research for prevention of Covid-19. Contributors from six continents address the question: In what circumstances - if any â€’ is it ethically acceptable to use a research design in which the control group in a randomised, controlled trial (RCT) receives a placebo instead of a vaccine already approved for emergency use by regulatory bodies? That ethical question is not new."

2907,Prioritizing the marginalized in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.,"A recent correspondence pointed out that indigenous people and other ethnic communities should be included in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. Indigenous communities carry a unique set of cultural beliefs and traditions that need to be preserved. This paper suggests that, aside from indigenous people, other marginalized sectors should also be included in the vaccine rollout by the government."
2908,Different Methods for Molecular and Rapid Detection of Human Novel Coronavirus.,"Introduction: While PCR has been recognized as one of the appropriate ways to diagnose infectious diseases, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) which is a nucleic acid amplification method, can be considered as an alternative to PCR, and it is faster, cost-effective, and easier to perform than nested PCR. Patients and methods: Keywords were searched in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, as well as the search engine of Google Scholar. Keywords included PCR, LAMP, RAA, RPA, Virus and COVID-19. Results: LAMP technology has been extensively applied for the detection of human pathogenic bacteria, crop pests, pathogenic organisms and components in meat products. A new isotheral method, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), can amplify the DNA as well as RPA. RPA involves benefits of isothermal PCR as well as simplicity and rapid amplification. Recombinase aided amplification (RAA) assay has been favorably used in the detection of bacterial and viral pathogens and solved the technical difficulties posed by DNA amplification methods because it does not need thermal denaturation of the template and involves a low and constant temperature. Conclusion: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, digital PCR, LAMP, nicking endonuclease amplification reaction, recombinase polymerase amplification, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats are different nucleic acid amplification tests of COVID-19. LAMP methods can be more specific than qPCR and immunoassays. The LAMP assay can be applied for rapid detection of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza, because LAMP is a highly sensitive and specific DNA/RNA amplification technique."
