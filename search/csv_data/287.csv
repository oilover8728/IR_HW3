2860,Broad respiratory testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 viral co-circulation and inform diagnostic stewardship in the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can present with a broad clinical differential that includes many other respiratory viruses; therefore, accurate tests are crucial to distinguish true COVID-19 cases from pathogens that do not require urgent public health interventions. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses is largely unknown during the COVID-19 pandemic but would inform strategies to rapidly and accurately test patients with respiratory symptoms. Methods: This study retrospectively examined 298,415 respiratory specimens collected from symptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 testing in the three months since COVID-19 was initially documented in the province of Alberta, Canada (March-May, 2020). By focusing on 52,285 specimens that were also tested with the Luminex Respiratory Pathogen Panel for 17 other pathogens, this study examines the prevalence of 18 potentially co-circulating pathogens and their relative rates in prior years versus since COVID-19 emerged, including four endemic coronaviruses. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 2.2% of all specimens. Parallel broad multiplex testing detected additional pathogens in only 3.4% of these SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens: significantly less than in SARS-CoV-2-negative specimens (p < 0.0001), suggesting very low rates of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Furthermore, the overall co-infection rate was significantly lower among specimens with SARS-CoV-2 detected (p < 0.0001). Finally, less than 0.005% of all specimens tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and any of the four endemic coronaviruses tested, strongly suggesting neither co-infection nor cross-reactivity between these coronaviruses. Conclusions: Broad respiratory pathogen testing rarely detected additional pathogens in SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens. While helpful to understand co-circulation of respiratory viruses causing similar symptoms as COVID-19, ultimately these broad tests were resource-intensive and inflexible in a time when clinical laboratories face unprecedented demand for respiratory virus testing, with further increases expected during influenza season. A transition from broad, multiplex tests toward streamlined diagnostic algorithms targeting respiratory pathogens of public health concern could simultaneously reduce the overall burden on clinical laboratories while prioritizing testing of pathogens of public health importance. This is particularly valuable with ongoing strains on testing resources, exacerbated during influenza seasons."
2861,COVID-19: vaccination in a developing country.,The common good and public service are important to gain public trust especially in the midst of a pandemic of misinformation about vaccines and miracle therapies being spread on social media. Controversies in the government of a developing country do not help to control the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Is it only the government's responsibility or can doctors and medical students promote the truth with appropriate communication strategies to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy?
2862,Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in patients receiving kidney replacement therapy.,"In this issue of Kidney International, the initial experience regarding the immunogenicity of prior coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and the response to the COVID-19 vaccines among patients on maintenance dialysis and kidney transplant recipients is summarized. Preliminary data suggest that there is durability of immune response after COVID-19 infection. Although immune response to the first dose of vaccine is less in infection-naÃ¯ve patients than healthy individuals in both groups, after the second vaccine dose a significant portion of patients receiving maintenance dialysis develop robust antibody titers, whereas kidney transplant recipients show a less-strong immune response."
2863,Clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of inconclusive results in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays.,"Background: Inconclusive results in SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays cause confusion among clinicians and delay appropriate infection prevention and control. In this study, we aimed to characterize the respiratory specimens associated with inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay results. Methods: We re-evaluated inconclusive specimens by 3 additional RT-PCR assays and attempted to detect subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) in these specimens. Results: Among follow-up tests from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 36.3% of the inconclusive results were classified as presumptive positive results (45/124). However, none of the specimens from 36 screening cases was classified as a presumptive positive result. Among 160 inconclusive specimens, sgRNAs were detected in 78 samples (48.8%): 58 were confirmed cases (58/124, 46.8%) and 20 were screening cases (20/36, 55.6%). Conclusions: The results of our study suggest the recommendation of considering inconclusive results as positive results for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. In screening cases, viral remnants could be partially amplified in PCR assays, and these inconclusive results could be related to previous infections. In addition, sgRNAs were detected in about half of the inconclusive specimens; however, the clinical significance of sgRNA is not yet clear."
2864,COVID-19 Testing.,"Objectives: To illustrate how patient risk and clinical costs are driven by false-positive and false-negative results. Methods: Molecular, antigen, and antibody testing are the mainstay to identify infected patients and fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To evaluate the test methods, sensitivity (percent positive agreement [PPA]) and specificity (percent negative agreement [PNA]) are the most common metrics utilized, followed by the positive and negative predictive value-the probability that a positive or negative test result represents a true positive or negative patient. The number, probability, and cost of false results are driven by combinations of prevalence, PPA, and PNA of the individual test selected by the laboratory. Results: Molecular and antigen tests that detect the presence of the virus are relevant in the acute phase only. Serologic assays detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the recovering and recovered phase. Each testing methodology has its advantages and disadvantages. Conclusions: We demonstrate the value of reporting probability of false-positive results, probability of false-negative results, and costs to patients and health care. These risk metrics can be calculated from the risk drivers of PPA and PNA combined with estimates of prevalence, cost, and Reff number (people infected by 1 positive SARS-CoV-2 carrier)."

2866,The battle for COVID-19 vaccines highlights the need for a new global governance mechanism.,
2867,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: Where Are We Now?,"The best and safest way to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is by using vaccination to generate widespread immunity. The urgent need to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines was met with unprecedented speed and action from the global community. There are now 289 vaccines in the development pipeline. More remarkably, there are 20 publicly available vaccines, and more than 3.3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across 180 countries. This is just the beginning of our fight against the pandemic. Even at the current vaccination rate, it could take years to vaccinate the world's population; many high-income countries are focusing on their needs, whereas the poorer nations are waiting for vaccines. There is still much that we do not understand about immunity to this new disease, and we will have to contend with the emerging variants. In this commentary, we describe the current status of COVID-19 vaccine development and provide insights into how the development and approvals happened so quickly. We discuss the clinical trial data that led to rapid emergency use authorization and the many challenges of global rollout. We also comment on some of the key unanswered questions and future directions for COVID-19 vaccine development and deployment."
2868,Point-of-care bulk testing for SARS-CoV-2 by combining hybridization capture with improved colorimetric LAMP.,"Efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have spurred the need for reliable, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic methods which can be applied to large numbers of people. However, current standard protocols for the detection of viral nucleic acids while sensitive, require a high level of automation and sophisticated laboratory equipment to achieve throughputs that allow whole communities to be tested on a regular basis. Here we present Cap-iLAMP (capture and improved loop-mediated isothermal amplification) which combines a hybridization capture-based RNA extraction of gargle lavage samples with an improved colorimetric RT-LAMP assay and smartphone-based color scoring. Cap-iLAMP is compatible with point-of-care testing and enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in less than one hour. In contrast to direct addition of the sample to improved LAMP (iLAMP), Cap-iLAMP prevents false positives and allows single positive samples to be detected in pools of 25 negative samples, reducing the reagent cost per test to ~1 Euro per individual."
