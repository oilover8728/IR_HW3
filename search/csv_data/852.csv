8510,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Research, Clinical Knowledge, and Preventive Measures.","In early December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) commenced in Wuhan, China, and WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic and Public Health Emergency of International Concern. An ample number of clinical trials with multiple drugs is underway to overcome the current perilous condition. Still, the situation is alarming with no therapeutic measure in our hand at present. Keeping the present scenario in mind, this review comprises the research, clinical knowledge, and repurposed herbals with regard to COVID-19. Preventive measures such as yoga, nasal breathing, and herbal administration could also provide protection and beneficial effects against coronavirus. Innumerable clinical trials are ongoing to manage COVID-19 and the drugs were selected on the basis of life cycle of coronavirus. The selection of herbals was done on the basis of the previous reported pharmacological activities and docking study. The results concluded that garlic, liquorice, and Ashwagandha have a potential against SARS-CoV-2, which was further proved via a docking study and their reported biological functions. The very well-known fact ""prevention is always better than cure"" is applied to overcome with coronavirus infection. It is expected that following the preventive measures could impede or lessen the adverse effect of SARS-CoV-2."
8511,"Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 spike 69/70 deletion, E484K and N501Y variants by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited sera.","We engineered three severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viruses containing key spike mutations from the newly emerged United Kingdom (UK) and South African (SA) variants: N501Y from UK and SA; 69/70-deletion + N501Y + D614G from UK; and E484K + N501Y + D614G from SA. Neutralization geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 20 BTN162b2 vaccine-elicited human sera against the three mutant viruses were 0.81- to 1.46-fold of the GMTs against parental virus, indicating small effects of these mutations on neutralization by sera elicited by two BNT162b2 doses."
8512,Children and COVID-19: Microbiological and immunological insights.,"Since its first description in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. More than 10.3 million people have been infected and more than 506 000 people died. However, SARS-CoV-2 had a lower impact on the pediatric population. Only about 1% to 2% of infected people are children and few deaths under the age of 14 are described so far. In this article, we discuss microbiological and immunological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children highlighting the main differences from adult SARS-CoV-2 infection."
8513,Interpretation of laboratory tests for prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.,"With the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), medical providers should take care to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals including super-spreading. Understanding super-spreading would be useful to reduce future transmission. Some publications have shown clusters of SARS-CoV-2 such as at choir practice and in hospitals. Aerosol can be considered as a primary transmission route. As SARS-CoV-2 stability in aerosol is similar to SARS-CoV-1 with the higher reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV-1, another factor causes rapidly spread-out, e.g. a higher discharge ratio from infected people or a higher viral intake ratio to human body. A basic research suggests higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in the nose than the peripheral lung. Universal masking would be important to prevent the exposure of SARS-CoV-2 droplet to uninfected people. To detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, laboratory tests such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are applied. Although sensitivity and specificity are provided for the ability of the test, positive or negative prediction values are useful to indicate the possiblity of infection or non-infection in clinical practice. We have to realize that the positive and negative prediction values depend on the sensitivity, specificity, and infection probability of the patient."

8515,"Recent Advancements in the Diagnosis, Prevention, and Prospective Drug Therapy of COVID-19.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously called 2019 novel CoV, emerged from China in late December 2019. This virus causes CoV disease-19 (COVID-19), which has been proven a global pandemic leading to a major outbreak. As of June 19, 2020, the data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed more than 8.7 million confirmed cases in over 200 countries/regions. The WHO has declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. CoVs cause illnesses that range in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illnesses and death. Nevertheless, with technological advances and imperative lessons gained from prior outbreaks, humankind is better outfitted to deal with the latest emerging group of CoVs. Studies on the development of in vitro diagnostic tests, vaccines, and drug re-purposing are being carried out in this field. Currently, no approved treatment is available for SARS-CoV-2 given the lack of evidence. The results from preliminary clinical trials have been mixed as far as improvement in the clinical condition and reduction in the duration of treatment are concerned. A number of new clinical trials are currently in progress to test the efficacy and safety of various approved drugs. This review focuses on recent advancements in the field of development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatment approaches for COVID-19."
8516,"Editorial: Autoantibodies to Components of the Immune System, Including Type 1 Interferons, and the Risk of Severe COVID-19.","During the past two years, clinical studies have attempted to identify risk factors to predict clinical outcomes following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In July 2021, a study using a high-throughput technique detected autoantibodies to chemokines, cytokines, and complement components in patients with symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In August 2021, a study identified pre-existing autoantibodies to type 1 interferons (IFNs) in 10% of patients with severe COVID-19 but not asymptomatic individuals. Autoantibodies may be the long-awaited markers of clinical risk for severe COVID-19 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This Editorial aims to present some recent findings of autoantibodies to components of the immune system, including type 1 IFNs, and the risk of severe COVID-19."
8517,Specialist confirmed allergic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines at a mass vaccination site.,"Healthcare providers can play a key role in reaching the target for vaccine uptake through educating the public on the risk may be of severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, it is important to resolve reports in the literature which present conflicting data on vaccine safety. We performed a prospective study of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinations administered at the Albany Community Vaccination Center. All potential vaccinees to the site were screened for allergic history prior to triage by a board-certified allergist. In the first 14 days of operation, our site vaccinated 14,655 individuals, 3.9% of which had a personal history of anaphylaxis. While some vaccine recipients had non-allergic complications, none of the visitors suffered any objective, immediate allergic symptoms. Our findings indicate that specialist-confirmed rates of immediate allergic reaction to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are far lower than self-reported rates defined by subjective, unconfirmed symptoms."
8518,Epidemiological Features of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in China.,"The fast-growing outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan locating in central China at the end of 2019, spread to multiple cities in merely a month. Although the mortality of this disease was lower than that of SARS, the incredible contagiousness was much higher than SRAS-CoV. Because of the tremendous clout of 2019-nCoV, it is essential to hold more details about it and monitor its future evolution. This mini review consequently summarizes the key elements of epidemiology features, providing updated relevant findings and novel insights related to 2019-nCoV."
8519,Impact of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases on the severity of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We examined the effects of coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension and diabetes on the development of severe COVID-19. We performed a comprehensive, systematic literature search for studies published between December 2019 and July 5, 2020 in five databases. The prevalence of severe COVID-19 in patients with CHD, hypertension and diabetes was evaluated through a meta-analysis. Thirty-five articles with 8,170 patients were included, and all the available studies were case series. The pooled odds ratio for the development of severe COVID-19 was 3.21 for patients with CHD (fixed-effects model, 95% CI: 2.58-3.99), 2.27 for patients with hypertension (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-2.90) and 2.34 for patients with diabetes (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-3.05). The heterogeneity of the studies was moderate for the effect of CHD on COVID-19 severity, but was high for the effects of diabetes and hypertension. Funnel plots and Egger's tests revealed no publication bias in the CHD and hypertension analyses, but suggested publication bias in the diabetes analysis. This bias was corrected using the trim-and-fill method, and was ultimately found to have no effect on the results. Our findings suggest patients with CHD, hypertension and diabetes are at greater risk for developing severe COVID-19 than those without these conditions."
