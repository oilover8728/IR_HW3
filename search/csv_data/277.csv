2760,Assessment of Sample Pooling for Clinical SARS-CoV-2 Testing.,"Accommodating large increases in sample workloads has presented a major challenge to clinical laboratories during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite the implementation of automated detection systems and previous efficiencies, including barcoding, electronic data transfer, and extensive robotics, capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in clinical settings is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly detection failures with weakly positive samples. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with a focus on pools containing weakly positive specimens. Additionally, the frequencies of occurrence of weakly positive samples during the pandemic were reviewed. Weakly positive specimens, with threshold cycle (CT ) values of 33 or higher, were detected in 95% of 60 five-sample pools but only 87% of 39 nine-sample pools. The proportion of positive samples with very low viral loads rose markedly during the first few months of the pandemic, peaking in June, decreasing thereafter, and remaining level since August. At all times, weakly positive specimens comprised a significant component of the sample population, ranging from 29% to >80% for CT values above 31. In assessing the benefits of pooling strategies, however, other aspects of the testing process must be considered. Accessioning, result data management, electronic data transfer, reporting, and billing are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures. Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to implementing such a strategy."
2761,"High SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IGM seroprevalence in asymptomatic Congolese in Brazzaville, the Republic of Congo.","Introduction: The Republic of the Congo detected its first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on March 14, 2020, and within several weeks, the country had introduced protective measures that were still in force in July 2020. Over the course of time, the progression in the number of clinical cases has appeared to be lower than expected, although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has been somewhat limited. In order to evaluate the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Congolese population, a seroprevalence study was conducted on healthy individuals from different districts of Brazzaville who were willing to know their COVID-19 infection status. Methods: Oropharyngeal swab and blood samples were collected from 754 healthy volunteers between April 2020 and July 2020. The samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 using a qualitative RT-PCR assay, and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were detected using two different rapid tests. Results: A total of 56 participants (7.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The remaining 698 participants (92.6%) had negative RT-PCR results; of these, 117 were found to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using serological tests. For these RT-PCR-negative subjects, the seroprevalence of IgG and IgM was found to increase over time: from 1.7% and 2.5% in April, up to 14.2% and 17.6% in July, respectively. In April 2020, 5% of the women were found to have IgG or IgM antibodies, whereas the antibodies were not detected in any of the men. The seroprevalence in RT-PCR negative subjects was significantly higher in women within IgG (P = 0.012) and IgM (P = 0.045) over the first three months. Conclusion: The proportion of the population who seroconvert over the course of the first wave is an important data to predict the risk of future COVID-19 waves and this will facilitate the efficient use of limited resources in a low income country like the Republic of the Congo."

2764,Text Mining Approaches to Analyze Public Sentiment Changes Regarding COVID-19 Vaccines on Social Media in Korea.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world, resulting in a tremendous change to people's lifestyles. We investigated the Korean public response to COVID-19 vaccines on social media from 23 February 2021 to 22 March 2021. We collected tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines using the Korean words for ""coronavirus"" and ""vaccines"" as keywords. A topic analysis was performed to interpret and classify the tweets, and a sentiment analysis was conducted to analyze public emotions displayed within the retrieved tweets. Out of a total of 13,414 tweets, 3509 were analyzed after preprocessing. Eight topics were extracted using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, and the most frequently tweeted topic was vaccine hesitation, consisting of fear, flu, safety of vaccination, time course, and degree of symptoms. The sentiment analysis revealed a similar ratio of positive and negative tweets immediately before and after the commencement of vaccinations, but negative tweets were prominent after the increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The public's anticipation, disappointment, and fear regarding vaccinations are considered to be reflected in the tweets. However, long-term trend analysis will be needed in the future."
2765,Results of preoperative screening for COVID-19 correlate with the incidence of infection in the general population -a tertiary care experience.,"Objectives: Many hospitals have recently instituted policies mandating preoperative COVID-19 testing. However, it is uncertain whether institutions can dictate such policies based on infection rates found in the general population. Therefore, the main aims of the study were to determine (1) what proportion of preoperative patients tested positive, (2) what percentage was asymptomatic, and (3) whether variations throughout time in numbers of positive patients reflected changes observed in our state.Methods: All COVID-19 preoperative screening tests (nasopharyngeal-swab RT-PCR testing) performed in our hospital between 04/13/2020 and 08/27/2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The unit of analysis was number of patients who tested negative/positive. Medical records of positive patients were reviewed to determine the presence of COVID-19 symptoms. A curve was created showing our number of positive patients per week and another one presenting the number of positive patients per day in Florida, both figures were compared.Results: A total of 7,213 patients from all specialties were preoperatively tested, out of which 85 were positive for an overall infection rate of 1.2%. In 18% (15/85) of positive patients, it was not possible to determine symptomatology. Among remaining patients, 49% (34/70) were asymptomatic while 51% (36/70) were symptomatic for COVID-19. Peak of positive cases occurred in mid-July in both curves, and the upward and downward tendencies in positive numbers mirrored each other.Conclusion: COVID-19 infection rate among our preoperative patients was very low. Nearly 50% of positive patients were asymptomatic. Our data suggest that a tertiary hospital can promulgate COVID-19 preoperative screening policies based on infection trends observed in the general population. However, in addition to the test, patients should be encouraged to self-quarantine for 14 days before surgery."
2766,"[Differential clinic in children infected by SARS-CoV-2, traceability of contacts and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tests: Cross-sectional observational study].","Introduction: Given the possible coexistence of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 with other seasonal infections, the aim is to identify differential symptoms. There has been studied the role of children in intrafamily contagion and the sensitivity of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an area with low community transmission. Material and methods: Cross-sectional observational study. Patients between 0-15 years studied by RT-PCR technique due to clinical suspicion of infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus in the months of March-May 2020. Survey on symptoms and contacts. Determination of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at least 21 days after the RT-PCR test. Results: 126 patients were included, 33 with confirmed infection and mean age 8.4 years (95% CI 6.8-10,5), age higher than not infected. Fever was the most common symptom and with greater sensitivity. The differences found were a greater frequency of anosmia (P=0.029) and headache (P=.009) among children infected with a specificity of 96.7% and 81.5% respectively. There were no differences in the duration of the symptoms. 81.8% of those infected were probably infected in the family nucleus, 85.2% by a parent who worked outside the home. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 70.9% and its negative predictive value 91.1%. Conclusions: The clinical picture is nonspecific and the more specific symptoms difficult to detect in younger children. Children had a reduced role in the intrafamily transmission. The sensitivity of RT-PCR could be related to a less contagiousness in children after one week of infection."

2768,Thermal inactivation of COVID-19 specimens improves RNA quality and quantity.,"The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, poses a huge demand for immediate diagnosis. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs have been used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. To avoid the risk of viral-exposure of laboratory workers, thermal inactivation is currently recommended but has unknown effects on the accuracy of the rRT-PCR results. Thirty-six NP/OP specimens were collected from COVID-19 patients and subjected to thermal inactivation (60°C for 30 min) or the RNA extraction processes to activate the form. Here, our data showed that the concentration of extracted-RNA increases upon thermal inactivation compared to the active form (p = .028). Significantly higher levels of RNA copy number were obtained in inactivated compared to the active samples for both N and ORF1ab genes (p = .009, p = .032, respectively). Thermal inactivation elevated concentration and copy number of extracted-RNA, possibly through viral-capsid degradation and/or nucleoprotein denaturation."
2769,"Virology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and in-line treatment of COVID-19.","SARS-CoV-2, a newly emerged pathogen in December 2019, marked as one of the highly pathogenic Coronavirus, and altogether this is the third coronavirus attack that crossed the species barrier. As of 1st July 2020, it is spreading around 216 countries, areas or territories, and a total of 10,185,374 and 503,862 confirmed cases and death reports, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 virus entered into the target cells by binding with the hACE2 receptors. Spike glycoprotein promotes the entry of the virus into host target cells. Literature reported a significant mutation in receptor binding sites and membrane proteins of the previous SARS-CoV to turned as SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for most dreadful pandemic COVID-19. These modifications may be the probable reason for the extreme transmission and pathogenicity of the virus. A hasty spread of COVID-19 throughout the world is highly threatening, but still, scientists do not have a proper therapeutic measure to fight with it. Scientists are endeavoring across the world to find effective therapy to combat COVID 19. Several drugs such as Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine, Ribavirin, Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Favipiravir, Interferons, Bevacizumab, Azithromycin, etc. are currently under clinical trials. Vaccine development from various pharmaceutical companies and research institutes is under progress, and more than ten vaccine candidates are in the various phases of clinical trials. This review work highlighted the origin, emergence, structural features, pathogenesis, and clinical features of COVID-19. We have also discussed the in-line treatment strategies, preventive measures, and vaccines to combat the emergence of COVID-19."
