2000,Lab-on-a-Disc for Point-of-Care Infection Diagnostics.,"Reliable, inexpensive, and rapid diagnostic tools are essential to control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Many commercial kits for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics have played a crucial role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Most current standard in vitro diagnostic (IVD) protocols for infectious diseases are sensitive but time-consuming and require sophisticated laboratory equipment and specially trained personnel. Recent advances in biosensor technology suggest the potential to deliver point-of-care (POC) diagnostics that are affordable and provide accurate results in a short time. The ideal ""sample-in-answer-out"" type fully integrated POC infection diagnostic platforms are expected to be autonomous or easy-to-operate, equipment-free or infrastructure-independent, and high-throughput or easy to upscale. In this Account, we detail the recent progress made by our group and others in the development of centrifugal microfluidic devices or lab-on-a-disc (LOAD) systems. Unlike conventional pump-based fluid actuation, the centrifugal force generated by spinning the disc induces liquid pumping and no external fluidic interconnects are required. This allows a total fluidic network required for multiple steps of biological assays to be integrated on a disc, enabling fully automated POC diagnostics. Various applications have been demonstrated, including liquid biopsy for personalized cancer management, food applications, and environmental monitoring; here, we focus on IVD for infectious disease. First, we introduce various on-disc unit operation technologies, including reagent storage, sedimentation, filtration, valving, decanting, aliquoting, mixing, separation, serial dilution, washing, and calibration. Such centrifugal microfluidic technologies have already proved promising for micro-total-analysis systems for automated IVD ranging from molecular detection of pathogens to multiplexed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that use raw samples such as whole blood or saliva. Some recent examples of LOAD systems for molecular diagnostics in which some or all steps of the assays are integrated on a disc, including pathogen enrichment, nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection, are discussed in detail. We then introduce fully automated ELISA systems with enhanced sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate a toy-inspired fidget spinner that enables electricity-free and rapid analysis of pathogens from undiluted urine samples of patients with urinary tract infection symptoms and a phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility test for an extreme POC diagnostics application. Considering the urgent need for cost-effective and reliable POC infection diagnostic tools, especially in the current pandemic crisis, the current limitations and future directions of fast and broad adaptation in real-world settings are also discussed. With proper attention to key challenges and leverage with recent advances in bio-sensing technologies, molecular biology, nanomaterials, analytical chemistry, miniaturization, system integration, and data management, LOAD systems hold the potential to deliver POC infection diagnostic tools with unprecedented performance regarding time, accuracy, and cost. We hope the new insight and promise of LOAD systems for POC infection diagnostics presented in this Account can spark new ideas and inspire further research and development to create better healthcare systems for current and future pandemics."

2003,A patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 over 100 days.,"We recently experienced a patient with viral isolation by culture 4 months after the acute infection. an 83-year-old Japanese man visited our outpatient clinic with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The patient was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection by a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test. Three months after his clinic visit, he had regained most of his pre-COVID-19 level of health. However, qRT-PCR tests continued to be positive. At day 111, specimens from a nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were inoculated into VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.(1) Three to five days post-inoculation, cytopathic effects were observed, and viral RNA was detected in the culture supernatant by qRT-PCR (Ct values: 29–37). The culture supernatant of the VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells cocultured with the nasopharyngeal swab was passaged to the fresh VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, and after 3 days of the passage, cytopathic effect was observed again. In the supernatant of the passaged cell culture, viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR (Ct value: 29). By sequencing the qRT-PCR product using Illumina iSEQ100, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence was verified. These results indicate the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal specimen even at day 111. Although SARS-CoV-2 was present, the patient developed neutralizing antibodies by a microtiter method. We tested but did not isolate SARS-CoV-2 in samples of saliva, urine, blood, or stool. Patients with ongoing symptoms of COVID-19, long-haulers, could be chronically infected with COVID-19, although they might be incapable of transmission."
2004,Resurgence of SARS-CoV-2: Detection by community viral surveillance.,"Surveillance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has mainly relied on case reporting, which is biased by health service performance, test availability, and test-seeking behaviors. We report a community-wide national representative surveillance program in England based on self-administered swab results from ~594,000 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, between May and the beginning of September 2020. The epidemic declined between May and July 2020 but then increased gradually from mid-August, accelerating into early September 2020 at the start of the second wave. When compared with cases detected through routine surveillance, we report here a longer period of decline and a younger age distribution. Representative community sampling for SARS-CoV-2 can substantially improve situational awareness and feed into the public health response even at low prevalence."
2005,Psychological and Behavioral Predictors of Vaccine Efficacy: Considerations for COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidates are being evaluated, with the goal of conferring immunity on the highest percentage of people who receive the vaccine as possible. It is noteworthy that vaccine efficacy depends not only on the vaccine but also on characteristics of the vaccinated. Over the past 30 years, a series of studies has documented the impact of psychological factors on the immune system's vaccine response. Robust evidence has demonstrated that stress, depression, loneliness, and poor health behaviors can impair the immune system's response to vaccines, and this effect may be greatest in vulnerable groups such as the elderly. Psychological factors are also implicated in the prevalence and severity of vaccine-related side effects. These findings have generalized across many vaccine types and therefore may be relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this review, we discuss these psychological and behavioral risk factors for poor vaccine responses, their relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as targeted psychological and behavioral interventions to boost vaccine efficacy and reduce side effects. Recent data suggest these psychological and behavioral risk factors are highly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, but intervention research suggests that psychological and behavioral interventions can increase vaccine efficacy."
2006,Laboratory testing for suspected COVID-19 vaccine-induced (immune) thrombotic thrombocytopenia.,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents a pandemic, and several vaccines have been produced to prevent infection and/or severe sequelae associated with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. There have been several reports of infrequent post vaccine associated thrombotic events, in particular for adenovirus-based vaccines. These have variously been termed VIPIT (vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia), VITT (vaccine-induced [immune] thrombotic thrombocytopenia), VATT (vaccine-associated [immune] thrombotic thrombocytopenia), and TTS (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome). In this report, the laboratory test processes, as utilised to assess suspected VITT, are reviewed. In published reports to date, there are notable similarities and divergences in testing approaches, potentially leading to identification of slightly disparate patient cohorts. The key to appropriate identification/exclusion of VITT, and potential differentiation from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT), is identification of potentially differential test patterns. In summary, testing typically comprises platelet counts, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and various immunological and functional assays for platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies. In suspected VITT, there is a generally highly elevated level of D-dimer, thrombocytopenia, and PF4 antibodies can be identified by ELISA-based assays, but not by other immunological assays typically positive in HITT. In addition, in some functional platelet activation assays, standard doses of heparin have been identified to inhibit activation in suspected VITT, but they tend to augment activation in HITT. Conversely, it is also important to not over-diagnose VITT, given that not all cases of thrombosis post vaccination will have an immune basis and not all PF4-ELISA positive patients will be VITT."

2008,Multiplexed and Extraction-Free Amplification for Simplified SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Tests.,"The rapid onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenges for accurately diagnosing the disease, including supply shortages for sample collection, preservation, and purification. Currently, most diagnostic tests require RNA extraction and detection by RT-PCR; however, extraction is expensive and time-consuming and requires technical expertise. With these challenges in mind, we report extraction-free, multiplexed amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 246 clinical samples, resulting in 86% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The multiplex RT-PCR uses the CDC singleplex targets and has an LoD of 2 c/μL. We also report on amplification using a range of master mixes in different transport media. This work can help guide which combinations of reagents will enable accurate results when availability of supplies changes throughout the pandemic. Implementing these methods can reduce complexity and cost, minimize reagent usage, expedite time to results, and increase testing capacity."
