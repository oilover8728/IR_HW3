5510,[Diagnostic imaging findings in COVID-19].,"This is a review of diagnostic imaging findings in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). CT findings are frequently bilateral, multilobar and peripheral ground-glass opacities with vascular enlargements. Consolidations often appear during progression as well as crazy paving and reticulation. Lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions and pneumothorax are rare and should raise concern for other disease. Initially the CT can be normal, and the diagnostic performance for COVID-19 is not optimal. However, findings of characteristic ground-glass opacities during the ongoing epidemic should lead to considerations, that the patient may have COVID-19."
5511,"Does COVID-19 Vaccination Warrant the Classical Principle ""ofelein i mi vlaptin""?","The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic warrants an imperative necessity for effective and safe vaccination, to restrain Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) including transmissibility, morbidity, and mortality. In this regard, intensive medical and biological research leading to the development of an arsenal of vaccines, albeit incomplete preconditioned evaluation, due to emergency. The subsequent scientific gap raises some concerns in the medical community and the general public. More specifically, the accelerated vaccine development downgraded the value of necessary pre-clinical studies to elicit medium- and long-term beneficial or harmful consequences. Previous experience and pathophysiological background of coronaviruses' infections and vaccine technologies, combined with the global vaccines' application, underlined the obligation of a cautious and qualitative approach, to illuminate potential vaccination-related adverse events. Moreover, the high SARS-CoV-2 mutation potential and the already aggregated genetical alterations provoke a rational vagueness and uncertainty concerning vaccines' efficacy against dominant strains and the respective clinical immunity. This review critically summarizes existing evidence and queries regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, to motivate scientists' and clinicians' interest for an optimal, individualized, and holistic management of this unprecedented pandemic."

5513,Diagnostic and treatment recommendations from the FACME ad-hoc expert working group on the management of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associated with COVID-19 vaccination.,"Introduction: Cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been reported in individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 with non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines. We issue our recommendations on the diagnosis and management of patients presenting this complication. Methods: The multidisciplinary working group, led by the Spanish Federation of Medical and Scientific Associations (FACME) and including representatives of several scientific societies, reviewed the available evidence from the literature and reports of the European Medicines Agency. We establish a definition for suspected cases and issue diagnostic and treatment recommendations regarding vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia. Results: We define suspected cases as those cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurring between 3 and 21 days after the administration of non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines, in patients with a platelet count below 150 000/μL or presenting a decrease of 50% with respect to the previous value. Findings suggestive of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia include the presence of antibodies to platelet factor 4, D-dimer levels 4 times greater than the upper limit of normal, and unexplained thrombosis. The recommended treatment includes intravenous administration of non-specific human immunoglobulin or alternatively plasmapheresis, avoiding the use of heparin, instead employing argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, or apixaban for anticoagulation, and avoiding platelet transfusion. Conclusions: Non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines may be associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopaenia; it is important to treat the dysimmune phenomenon and the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis."
5514,An unusual case of bullous haemorrhagic vasculitis in a COVID-19 patient.,"A novel Coronavirus strain, named “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2” (SARS‐CoV‐2) was recently identified as the etiological agent of the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Interestingly, a consistent number of COVID‐19‐associated skin manifestations seem to share a certain degree of vascular damage as common pathogenetic mechanism1. Vascular injury may be due to the direct damage of endothelial cells by the virus or may represents an epiphenomenon of a dysregulated host inflammatory responses triggered by the infection2. Here, we describe an unprecedented case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis presenting with a hemorrhagic bullous eruption in a patient affected by COVID‐19."
5515,Vaccines to prevent COVID-19: a protocol for a living systematic review with network meta-analysis including individual patient data (The LIVING VACCINE Project).,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has rapidly spread worldwide. Several human randomized clinical trials assessing potential vaccines are currently underway. There is an urgent need for a living systematic review that continuously assesses the beneficial and harmful effects of all available vaccines for COVID-19. Methods/design: We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials. We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available. Two review authors will independently extract data and conduct risk of bias assessments. We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any vaccine aiming to prevent COVID-19 (including but not limited to messenger RNA; DNA; non-replicating viral vector; replicating viral vector; inactivated virus; protein subunit; dendritic cell; other vaccines) with any comparator (placebo; ""active placebo;"" no intervention; standard care; an ""active"" intervention; another vaccine for COVID-19) for participants in all age groups. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality; a diagnosis of COVID-19; and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be quality of life and non-serious adverse events. The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network meta-analyses, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Within-study bias will be assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) and Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approaches will be used to assess certainty of evidence. Observational studies describing harms identified during the search for trials will also be included and described and analyzed separately. Discussion: COVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality. A living systematic review assessing the beneficial and harmful effects of different vaccines is urgently needed. This living systematic review will regularly inform best practice in vaccine prevention and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42020196492."

5517,Comparison of infection control strategies to reduce COVID-19 outbreaks in homeless shelters in the United States: a simulation study.,"Background: COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in homeless shelters across the US, highlighting an urgent need to identify the most effective infection control strategy to prevent future outbreaks. Methods: We developed a microsimulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a homeless shelter and calibrated it to data from cross-sectional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) surveys conducted during COVID-19 outbreaks in five homeless shelters in three US cities from March 28 to April 10, 2020. We estimated the probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak when an exposed individual is introduced into a representative homeless shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff over 30 days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening, twice-weekly PCR testing, and universal mask wearing. Results: The proportion of PCR-positive residents and staff at the shelters with observed outbreaks ranged from 2.6 to 51.6%, which translated to the basic reproduction number (R0) estimates of 2.9-6.2. With moderate community incidence (~ 30 confirmed cases/1,000,000 people/day), the estimated probabilities of averting an outbreak in a low-risk (R0 = 1.5), moderate-risk (R0 = 2.9), and high-risk (R0 = 6.2) shelter were respectively 0.35, 0.13, and 0.04 for daily symptom-based screening; 0.53, 0.20, and 0.09 for twice-weekly PCR testing; 0.62, 0.27, and 0.08 for universal masking; and 0.74, 0.42, and 0.19 for these strategies in combination. The probability of averting an outbreak diminished with higher transmissibility (R0) within the simulated shelter and increasing incidence in the local community. Conclusions: In high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community incidence of COVID-19, even intensive infection control strategies (incorporating daily symptom screening, frequent PCR testing, and universal mask wearing) are unlikely to prevent outbreaks, suggesting a need for non-congregate housing arrangements for people experiencing homelessness. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be employed to reduce outbreak risk."
