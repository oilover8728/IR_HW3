6121,[Impact of COVID-19 on oncological surgery of the upper gastrointestinal tract].,"Background: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic imposed limitations for elective surgery, impacting the associated hospital standards worldwide. As certain treatment windows must be adhered to in oncological surgery, the limited intensive care unit (ICU) capacity had to be critically distributed in order to do justice to both acutely ill and oncology patients. This manuscript summarizes the impact of COVID-19 on the management of oncological surgery of the upper gastrointestinal tract and particularly esophageal surgery in German medical centers. Material and methods: A survey of German centers for esophageal surgery was performed on the impact of COVID-19 on operative management for esophageal surgery during the first lockdown. After inspection, assessment, critical analysis and interpretation, the results were compared to the international literature. Results and discussion: Initial recommendations of international societies warned for caution and restraint regarding interventions of the upper gastrointestinal tract that were not absolutely necessary. Oncological surgery should be performed under strict restrictions, especially only after negative testing for COVID-19 and only with sufficiently available personal protective equipment for the personnel. Furthermore, minimally invasive procedures were preferably not recommended. In diseases with alternative treatment options, such as definitive chemoradiotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, these should be given priority when possible. In the further development of the pandemic, it was shown that due to a high standardization of preoperative management, postoperative results comparable to pre-pandemic times could be achieved particularly with respect to the diagnostics of infections."
6122,"Vaccines for neglected, emerging and re-emerging diseases.","Efforts to produce vaccines against SARS and MERS were prematurely halted since their scope was perceived to be geographically restricted and they were subsequently categorized as neglected diseases. However, when a similar virus spread globally triggering the COVID-19 pandemic, we were harshly reminded that several other neglected diseases might also be waiting for the perfect opportunity to become mainstream. As climate change drives urbanization, natural selection of pathogens and their intermediate vectors and reservoirs, the risk of neglected diseases emerging within a larger susceptible pool becomes an even greater threat. Availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 is widely considered the only way to end this pandemic. Similarly, vaccines are also seen as the best tools available to control the spread of neglected (sometimes referred to as emerging or re-emerging) diseases, until the water, hygiene and sanitation infrastructure is improved in areas of their prevalence. Vaccine production is usually cost and labour intensive and thus minimal funding is directed towards controlling and eliminating neglected diseases (NDs). A customised but sustainable approach is needed to develop and deploy vaccines against NDs. While safety, efficacy and public trust are the three main success pillars for most vaccines, affordability is vital when formulating vaccines for neglected diseases."
6123,"Analysis of clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of 95 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a retrospective analysis.","Background: Since December 2019, 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China and even the world. We sought to analyse the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of some cases with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia . Methods: In this retrospective study, we extracted the data on 95 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan Xinzhou District People's Hospital from January 16th to February 25th, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and abnormal radiologic findings. Outcomes were followed up until March 2th, 2020. Results: Higher temperature, blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, alanine aminotransferase activity, aspartate aminotransferase activity, Î± - hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity, lactate dehydrogenase activity and creatine kinase activity were related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, and so were lower lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage and total protein level. Age below 40 or above 60 years old, male, higher Creatinine level, and lower platelet count also seemed related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, however the P values were greater than 0.05, which mean under the same condition studies of larger samples are needed in the future. Conclusion: Multiple factors were related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, and more related studies are needed in the future."

6125,Aortoenteric fistula after endovascular mycotic aortic aneurysm exclusion: lessons learned during the COVID-19 era.,"We report a case of aortoenteric fistula 2 years following endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) for mycotic aneurysm presenting as upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Initial CT angiogram did not reveal the bleeding or connection to bowel, but endoscopy was suspicious of endograft in the duodenum. Management required a multidisciplinary approach. To stabilise the patient and to control bleeding, a 'bridging' endograft extension was performed. This was followed by open surgical removal of the EVAR endograft and lower limb in situ revascularisation. During postoperative recovery, the patient developed atypical, staged multisystemic symptoms (cardiac, pulmonary and neurological). With increasing awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic, the patient was found SARS-CoV-2-positive, which explained the progression of his symptoms. This was also reflected on other case reports in literature later."
6126,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a British Society of Gastroenterology Inflammatory Bowel Disease section and IBD Clinical Research Group position statement.,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global health crisis and mass vaccination programmes provide the best opportunity for controlling transmission and protecting populations. Despite the impressive clinical trial results of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines, important unanswered questions remain, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions. In this position statement endorsed by the British Society of Gastroenterology Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) section and IBD Clinical Research Group, we consider SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy in patients with IBD. The risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are anticipated to be very low, and we strongly support SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with IBD. Based on data from previous studies with other vaccines, there are conceptual concerns that protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be diminished in some patients with IBD, such as those taking anti-TNF drugs. However, the benefits of vaccination, even in patients treated with anti-TNF drugs, are likely to outweigh these theoretical concerns. Key areas for further research are discussed, including vaccine hesitancy and its effect in the IBD community, the effect of immunosuppression on vaccine efficacy, and the search for predictive biomarkers of vaccine success."
