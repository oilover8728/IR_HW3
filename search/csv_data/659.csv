6580,A cohort study of men infected with COVID-19 for presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their semen.,"Introduction: Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be detected in semen and transmitted sexually is a vital question that has, thus far, been inconclusive. Prior studies, with limited numbers, have included men in various stages of infection with most in the recovery phase of the illness. The timing of test results and severity of illness has made recruiting study participants a significant challenge. Our pilot study will examine semen from men with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 as well as those in the convalescent phase to determine if SARS-CoV-2 can be detected and its relationship, if any, with the severity of the disease. Methods: Eighteen men with a median age of 32 (range, 24-57) who tested positive for COVID-19 by rt-PCR analysis were enrolled and provided a semen sample. The study group demonstrated symptoms of COVID-19 ranging from asymptomatic to moderate and none required hospitalization. Samples were subjected to viral RNA extraction and then processed by real-time RT-PCR using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) panel of 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) primers and probes to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results: Length of time from diagnosis to providing a specimen ranged from 1 to 28 days (median, 6 days). Fifteen participants were symptomatic and three were asymptomatic, including recovering men, at the time of semen collection. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in any of the semen samples. Conclusion: Based on these preliminary results and consistent with prior findings, we suggest SARS-CoV-2 is not present in semen during the acute or convalescent phase of COVID-19."
6581,Attitudes of health care professionals towards COVID-19 vaccine - a sequence from Turkey.,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the attitudes of healthcare professionals toward the COVID -19 vaccine, which has been introduced to healthcare professionals at the beginning of 2021 and give information to them on the disease and vaccine. This cross-sectional analytical study has been performed by conducting an online survey to the healthcare professionals who work at the healthcare institutions in the province of Samsun in Turkey between December 2020 and January 2021. In addition to sixteen questions about the demographic characteristics, the ""Attitudes towards the COVID -19 vaccine"" scale has been used. MANOVA test and Spearman rho correlation coefficient were used in analytical examinations. A total of 1426 healthcare professional have been reached. 64.3% of participants were female, 44.1% were nurse/midwife and 66.6% were public employees. Regarding the questions in the sub-dimension of positive attitude, the rate of response of ""I agree/I strongly agree"" was between 40.6% and 54.6%. Positive attitude mean values differ according to gender, age, institution, presence of children, smoking status, being a relative who died due to COVID -19, and profession (respectively p < .001, p < .001, p < .001, p < .001, p = .002, p = .019, p < .001). It has been observed that positive and negative attitudes toward COVID -19 vaccination are almost equally distributed and some demographic factors affect the attitude. The opinions of healthcare professionals on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, which are the main elements of the vaccination effort, may affect the public perception of vaccination."
6582,Atypical Exanthem as Cutaneous Manifestation Related to COVID-19 at a Primary Healthcare Facility.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection attacks the mucosal structures of the respiratory tract, especially the bronchial mucosa and immune cells. The skin changes and manifestations related to COVID-19 infection remain not clearly understood. Cutaneous manifestations related to COVID-19 had been reported. Our patient manifested atypical cutaneous exanthem on her legs, with no other abnormalities found. We used oral azithromycin 500 mg, dexamethasone 0.5 mg, vitamin C 100 mg, and paracetamol 500 mg, which are available at Badak Baru Primary Health Care. The exanthem has improved after 10 days of treatment."
6583,COVID-19: Learning from Lessons To Guide Treatment and Prevention Interventions.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and first emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Since then, the virus has rapidly spread to many countries. While the outbreak in China appears to be in decline, the disease has spread across the world, with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection-related deaths. Here, we highlight (i) the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease and (ii) an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent COVID-19 and potential future related pandemics. Although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population. Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective. There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available. This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine."
6584,Efficient high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing to detect asymptomatic carriers.,"Recent reports suggest that 10 to 30% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) infected patients are asymptomatic and that viral shedding may occur before symptom onset. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities to prevent disease spread. We developed P-BEST, a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing, which identifies all positive subjects within a set of samples using a single round of testing. Each sample is assigned into multiple pools using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing. We pooled sets of 384 samples into 48 pools, providing both an eightfold increase in testing efficiency and an eightfold reduction in test costs, while identifying up to five positive carriers. We then used P-BEST to screen 1115 health care workers using 144 tests. P- BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that can be easily integrated into diagnostic laboratories."
6585,Recent MMR vaccination in health care workers and Covid-19: A test negative case-control study.,"Background: It has been hypothesised that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may afford cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 which may contribute to the wide variability in disease severity of Covid-19. Methods: We employed a test negative case-control study, utilising a recent measles outbreak during which many healthcare workers received the MMR vaccine, to investigate the potential protective effect of MMR against SARS-CoV-2 in 5905 subjects (n = 805 males, n = 5100 females). Results: The odds ratio for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, in recently MMR-vaccinated compared to not recently MMR-vaccinated individuals was 0.91 (95% CI 0.76, 1.09). An interaction analysis showed a significant interaction for sex. After sex-stratification, the odds ratio for testing positive for males was 0.43 (95% CI 0.24, 0.79, P = 0.006), and 1.01 (95% CI 0.83, 1.22, P = 0.92) for females. Conclusion: Our results indicate that there may be a protective effect of the MMR vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in males but not females."

6587,Varying presentations of COVID-19 in young heart transplant recipients: A case series.,"Background: Immunosuppression is considered a risk factor for more severe clinical presentation of COVID-19. Limited data regarding clinical outcome exist in adults, whereas very little is known about the spectrum of the disease in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of young heart transplant patients from our tertiary care center during the coronavirus pandemic in New York City and identified patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results: We present four cases with COVID-19 disease and elaborate on their presentation and clinical course. Conclusions: Although far from conclusive and limited by the small sample size and selection bias, these cases demonstrate mild and self-limited disease despite immunosuppressive therapy and various comorbidities that are expected to increase the severity of the clinical picture based on extrapolation from the adult experience with this novel disease."
6588,Parental plans to vaccinate children for COVID-19 in New York city.,"Once COVID-19 vaccines are approved for children < 12 years of age, high pediatric vaccination coverage will be needed to help minimize the public health threat from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. We conducted an online survey of 1,119 parents and caregivers of children â‰¤ 12 years in New York City from March 9 to April 11, 2021. Among parents surveyed, 61.9% reported plans to vaccinate their youngest child for COVID-19, 14.8% said they do not plan to vaccinate their child and 23.3% were unsure. Female and non-Hispanic Black parents were least likely to report plans to vaccinate their children. Safety, effectiveness and perceptions that children do not need vaccination were the primary reasons for vaccine hesitancy/resistance. Parents who have or will vaccinate themselves were significantly more likely to report they would vaccinate their children. Efforts to increase awareness about vaccine safety and education about the importance of vaccinating children are needed."
6589,Acute pericarditis and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: Case report.,"We present the case of a 51-year-old patient with acute pericarditis as the dominant manifestation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The patient was admitted to the emergency department during a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak with a suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A coronary angiogram was normal. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Laboratory tests revealed an increased white blood cell count, with neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia, elevated level of C-reactive protein, borderline elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and slightly elevated interleukin 6. Echocardiography showed a hyperechogenic pericardium posterolaterally with minimal localized pericardial effusion. A chest computed tomography scan showed a small zone of ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe (classified as CO-RADS 3). In patients with chest pain, ST elevation on electrocardiogram, a normal coronary angiogram, and suspected COVID-19, we should think of pericarditis as an unusual presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
