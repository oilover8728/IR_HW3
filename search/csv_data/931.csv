9300,Why Does SARS-CoV-2 Invade the Gastrointestinal Epithelium?,
9301,[Comment] COVID-19 vaccine safety.,"In response to the SARS‑CoV‑2 outbreak, and the resulting COVID‑19 pandemic, a global competition to develop an anti‑COVID‑19 vaccine has ensued. The targeted time frame for initial vaccine deployment is late 2020. The present article examines whether short‑term, mid‑term, and long‑term vaccine safety can be achieved under such an accelerated schedule, given the myriad vaccine‑induced mechanisms that have demonstrated adverse effects based on previous clinical trials and laboratory research. It presents scientific evidence of potential pitfalls associated with eliminating critical phase II and III clinical trials, and concludes that there is no substitute currently available for long‑term human clinical trials to ensure long‑term human safety."
9302,Chest CT features of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).,"A new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading worldwide and causes pneumonia, respiratory distress, thromboembolic events, and death. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, monitoring disease progression, determination of disease severity, and evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Chest CT can show important clues of 2019-nCoV disease (also known as COVID-19) in patients with an appropriate clinic. Prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to prevent disease transmission and provides close clinical observation of patients with clinically severe disease. Therefore, radiologists and clinicians should be familiar with the CT imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. Herein, we aimed to review the imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and examine the critical points to be considered for imaging in cases with COVID-19 suspicion."
9303,Impact of COVID-19 on Dentistry.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the health-care system drastically, including dental care practice. COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is thought to spread via close contact through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Owing to specific characteristics of dental care such as aerosol generation as well as close proximity to patients, dentistry is thought to be associated with the nosocomial spread of infection. The risk of bidirectional spread of infection between patient and dental care providers makes it critical to take additional precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. It is essential to understand that the guidelines for providing dental treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic will vary across the globe, and dental practices should be in compliance with their regional guidelines. This chapter aims to present an overview of the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission and its impact on dentistry and discuss measures to provide dental care during the time of the COVID-19 outbreak effectively."

9305,High Levels of Common Cold Coronavirus Antibodies in Convalescent Plasma Are Associated With Improved Survival in COVID-19 Patients.,"Background: COVID-19 Convalescent plasma (CCP) is safe and effective, particularly if given at an early stage of the disease. Our study aimed to identify an association between survival and specific antibodies found in CCP. Patients and methods: Patients ≥18 years of age who were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection and received CCP at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between 4/30/2020 and 8/20/2020 were included in the study. We quantified the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as antibodies against antigens of other coronavirus strains, in the CCP units and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes. For each antibody, a Bayesian exponential survival time regression model including prognostic variables was fit, and the posterior probability of a beneficial effect (PBE) of higher antibody level on survival time was computed. Results: CCP was administered to 44 cancer patients. The median age was 60 years (range 37-84) and 19 (43%) were female. Twelve patients (27%) died of COVID-19-related complications. Higher levels of two non-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, anti-HCoV-OC43 spike IgG and anti-HCoV-HKU1 spike IgG, had PBE = 1.00, and 4 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies had PBEs between 0.90 and 0.95. Other factors associated with better survival were shorter time to CCP administration, younger age, and female sex. Conclusions: Common cold coronavirus spike IgG antibodies anti-HCoV-OC43 and anti-HCoV-HKU1 may target a common domain for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. They provide a promising therapeutic target for monoclonal antibody production."
9306,A Testimony of the Surgent SARS-CoV-2 in the Immunological Panorama of the Human Host.,"The resurgence of SARS in the late December of 2019 due to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has shadowed the world with a pandemic. The physiopathology of this virus is very much in semblance with the previously known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the unprecedented transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 has been puzzling the scientific efforts. Though the virus harbors much of the genetic and architectural features of SARS-CoV, a few differences acquired during its evolutionary selective pressure is helping the SARS-CoV-2 to establish prodigious infection. Making entry into host the cell through already established ACE-2 receptor concerted with the action of TMPRSS2, is considered important for the virus. During the infection cycle of SARS-CoV-2, the innate immunity witnesses maximum dysregulations in its molecular network causing fatalities in aged, comorbid cases. The overt immunopathology manifested due to robust cytokine storm shows ARDS in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2. A delayed IFN activation gives appropriate time to the replicating virus to evade the host antiviral response and cause disruption of the adaptive response as well. We have compiled various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its unique structural features and ability to modulate innate as well adaptive response in host, aiming at understanding the dynamism of infection."
9307,An evaluation of 4 commercial assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a predominantly mildly symptomatic low prevalence Australian population.,"A total of 1080 individual patient samples (158 positive serology samples from confirmed, predominantly mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients and 922 serology negative including 496 collected pre-COVID) from four states in Australia were analysed on four commercial SARS-CoV-2 serological assays targeting antibodies to different antigens (Roche Elecsys and Abbott Architect: nucleocapsid; Diasorin Liaison and Euroimmun: spike). A subset was compared to immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) and micro-neutralisation. Sensitivity and specificity of the Roche (n = 1033), Abbott (n = 806), Diasorin (n = 1034) and Euroimmun (n = 175) were 93.7 %/99.5 %, 90.2 %/99.4 %, 88.6 %/98.6 % and 91.3 %/98.8 %, respectively. ROC analysis with specificity held at 99 % increased the sensitivity for the Roche and Abbott assays from 93.7% to 98.7% (cut-off 0.21) and 90.2 % to 94.0 % (cut-off 0.91), respectively. Overall seropositivity of samples increased from a maximum of 23 % for samples 0-7 days-post-onset of symptoms (dpos), to 61 % from samples 8-14dpos and 93 % from those >14dpos. IFA and microneutralisation values correlated best with assays targeting antibodies to spike protein with values >80 AU/mL on the Diasorin assay associated with neutralising antibody. Detectable antibody was present in 22/23 (96 %), 20/23 (87 %), 15/23 (65 %) and 9/22 (41 %) patients with samples >180dpos on the Roche, Diasorin, Abbott and microneutralisation assays respectively. Given the low prevalence in this community, two-step algorithms on initial positive results saw an increase in the positive predictive value (PPV) of positive samples (39 %-65 % to ≥98 %) for all combinations. Similarly accuracy increased from a range of 98.5 %-99.4 % to ≥99.8 % assuming a 1 % seroprevalence. Negative predictive value (NPV) was high (≥99.8 %) regardless of which assay was used initially."
9308,Comparison of Seven Commercial Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Nucleic Acid Detection Reagents with Pseudovirus as Quality Control Material.,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 threatens the whole world, which catalyzes a variety of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (NAT) kits. To monitor test quality and evaluate NAT kits, quality control materials that best simulate real clinical samples are needed. In this study, the performance of SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant, PCDH-based pseudovirus, and MS2-based pseudovirus as quality control materials was compared. PCDH-based pseudovirus was found to be more similar in characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 particle, and more suitable for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 NAT kits than MS2-based pseudovirus. Proper detection using sensitive and precise NAT kits is essential to guarantee diagnosis. Thus, limit of detection, precision, anti-inference ability, and cross-reactivity of NAT kits from PerkinElmer, Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co, Ltd, Shanghai Kehua Bio-Engineering Co, Ltd, Sansure Biotech Inc., Da An Gene Co, Ltd, Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co, Ltd, and Applied Biological Technologies Co, Ltd, were compared using PCDH-based pseudovirus. For the seven kits evaluated, N gene was more sensitive than ORF1ab gene in most kits, whereas E gene was most sensitive among the three genes in Shanghai Kehua Bio-Engineering Co, Ltd, and Applied Biological Technologies Co, Ltd. PerkinElmer got the lowest limit of detection for N gene at 11.61 copies/mL, and the value was 34.66 copies/mL for ORF1ab gene. All of the kits showed good precision, with CV values less than 5%, as well as acceptable anti-interference ability of 2 mg/L human genomic DNA. No cross-reactivity was observed with other respiratory viruses."
9309,COVID-19 Treatment Success After Repeat Courses of Azithromycin: A Report of Three Cases.,"Background: Azithromycin has been considered as a possible therapeutic agent for COVID-19 patients. However, there is limited data on its efficacy. Case presentation: We describe three patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who did not respond to the initial treatment but improved dramatically upon adding azithromycin with a successful outcome. Conclusion: We have presented evidence of the potential beneficial effect of the azithromycin in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in three different clinical settings. More evidence is needed regarding the microbiological data, safety, and efficacy of this medication in the management of COVID-19."
