9820,An updated review of the association of host genetic factors with susceptibility and resistance to COVID-19.,"The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human populations sparked a global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). According to preliminary data, about 14% of cases are considered severe and 5% of cases result in critical illness and, reported case fatality rates vary from 1% to more than 7%. However, the symptoms of the disease and the clinical outcome are very different in infected people. In view of these differences, it is clearly apparent that to gain insight into the biology of the SARS-CoV-2, it is important to study not just the infectious particle in itself but also to investigate the virus-host cell interactions that occur during infection. This review seeks to consider the various aspects of genetic factors in determining the susceptibility and host resistance to SARS-CoV-2 throughout the recently published literature."
9821,[Clinical features of asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 in children].,"Objective: To study the clinical features of asymptomatic or subclinical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 53 children who were confirmed with asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19, including epidemiological history, clinical typing, co-infection, time to clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs, laboratory examination results, length of hospital stay, and treatment outcome. Results: The children with asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 accounted for 30.5% (53/174) in children with COVID-19 hospitalized in the COVID-19 ward of Wuhan Children's Hospital. All cases occurred with familial aggregation. Among the 53 children, 35 (66%) had asymptomatic infection and 18 (34%) had subclinical infection. Mycoplasma infection was found in 17 children (32%). For the 53 children, the mean time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs was 9±4 days. Most laboratory markers were maintained within the normal range. The mean hospital stay was 11±4 days. Lung CT of 18 children with subclinical COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities, linear opacities, and patchy opacities, with relatively limited lesions. Conclusions: There is a high proportion of children with asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 among the children with COVID-19 hospitalized in the COVID-19 ward. The transmission risk of asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 should be taken seriously."
9822,Particulate matter and SARS-CoV-2: A possible model of COVID-19 transmission.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly developed into a pandemic throughout the world. This disease is a highly infectious novel coronavirus and can affect people of all ages. Previous reports observed that particulate matter (PM) provided a platform for intermixing with viruses (i.e., influenza). However, the role of PM in SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains unclear. In this paper, we propose that PM plays a direct role as a ""carrier"" of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to have a high affinity for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Indirectly, exposure to PM increases ACE2 expression in the lungs which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 viral adhesion. Thus, the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 in heavily polluted regions can be explained by upregulation of ACE2 caused by PM. PM could be both a direct and indirect transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 infection."
9823,COVID-19 infections in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (Northern Italy): a population-based retrospective analysis.,"Objectives: to study the cumulative incidence, the demographics and health conditions of the population tested for COVID-19, and to map the evolving distribution of individual cases in the population of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (North-Eastern Italy). Design: population-based observational study based on a record linkage procedure of databases included in the electronic health information system of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. Setting and participants: the study group consisted of individuals who resided in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region and who underwent COVID-19 testing from 01.03 to 24.04.2020. The study group was identified from the laboratory database, which contains all the microbiological testing performed in regional facilities. Tested people were categorized into positive or negative cases, based on test results. Main outcome measures: probability of being tested for and cumulative incidence of COVID-19. Results: the cumulative probability of being tested for COVID-19 was 278/10,000 inhabitants, while the cumulative incidence was 22 cases/10,000. Out of 33,853 tested people, 2,744 (8.1%) turned out to be positive for COVID-19. Women were tested more often than men (337 vs 216/10,000), and they showed a higher incidence of infection than men (25 and 19 infected cases/10,000 residents, respectively). Both cumulative incidence and cumulative probability of being tested were higher in the elderly population. About 25% of infected people was hosted in retirement homes and 9% was represented by healthcare workers. Thirty seven percent of positive cases had hypertension, 15% cardiologic diseases, while diabetes and cancer characterized 11.7% and 10% of the infected population, respectively. The geographic distribution of positive cases showed a faster spread of the infection in the city of Trieste, an urban area with the highest regional population density. Conclusions: the COVID-19 pandemic did not hit the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region as hard as other Northern Italian Regions. In the early phase, as documented in this study, the COVID-19 pandemic particularly affected women and elderly people, especially those living in retirement homes in Trieste."

A Population-based Study in Coastal Ecuador.,"Antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were detected in 303/673 rural Ecuadorian adults (45%), 77% of whom had compatible clinical manifestations. Seropositivity was associated with the use of open latrines. Our findings support the fears of mass spread of SARS-CoV-2 in rural Latin America and cannot exclude a contributing role for fecal-oral transmission."
9826,Graphene biosensors for bacterial and viral pathogens.,"The infection and spread of pathogens (e.g., COVID-19) pose an enormous threat to the safety of human beings and animals all over the world. The rapid and accurate monitoring and determination of pathogens are of great significance to clinical diagnosis, food safety and environmental evaluation. In recent years, with the evolution of nanotechnology, nano-sized graphene and graphene derivatives have been frequently introduced into the construction of biosensors due to their unique physicochemical properties and biocompatibility. The combination of biomolecules with specific recognition capabilities and graphene materials provides a promising strategy to construct more stable and sensitive biosensors for the detection of pathogens. This review tracks the development of graphene biosensors for the detection of bacterial and viral pathogens, mainly including the preparation of graphene biosensors and their working mechanism. The challenges involved in this field have been discussed, and the perspective for further development has been put forward, aiming to promote the development of pathogens sensing and the contribution to epidemic prevention."
9827,The Mutation Profile of SARS-CoV-2 Is Primarily Shaped by the Host Antiviral Defense.,"Understanding SARS-CoV-2 evolution is a fundamental effort in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus genomes have been broadly evolving due to the high number of infected hosts world-wide. Mutagenesis and selection are two inter-dependent mechanisms of virus diversification. However, which mechanisms contribute to the mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 remain under-explored. Here, we delineate the contribution of mutagenesis and selection to the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We generated a comprehensive phylogenetic tree with representative genomes. Instead of counting mutations relative to the reference genome, we identified each mutation event at the nodes of the phylogenetic tree. With this approach, we obtained the mutation events that are independent of each other and generated the mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The results suggest that the heterogeneous mutation patterns are mainly reflections of host (i) antiviral mechanisms that are achieved through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins, and (ii) probable adaptation against reactive oxygen species."

9829,Effectiveness of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe COVID 19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Though Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) is being used for management of COVID-19, the evidence is still equivocal. So, we carried out this study to evaluate the currently available data to provide evidence about CPT in COVD-19 patients. RCTs and observational studies with sample size with more than 5 were included in the analysis. Out of 196 studies, 12 studies were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out for 6 studies having a control arm. For dichotomous values, risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval was expressed. Main outcomes: All-cause mortality, clinical improvement by day 7 and viral detection by day 7 were the defined outcome measures before starting of data extraction. Result: For 6 studies (2 RCTs and 4 observational studies) with 474 patients, the overall pooled RR for all-cause mortality was 0.61 (95%CI: 0.37 to 0.99. P= 0.04). Only RCTs and only observational studies for all-cause mortality showed pooled RR of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.33 to 1.10, P=0.10) and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.17 to 1.36, P= 0.17) respectively. There was risk of bias in the studies due to randomization process and confounding. Sensitivity analysis was carried out only for observational studies. The overall pooled RR for clinical improvement by day 7 and viral detection by day 7 were 1.12 (95%CI: 0.96 to 1.31, P=0.16) and 0.19 (95%CI: 0.09 to 0.60, P < 0.0001). Conclusion and relevance: Though the review suggests modest utility of CPT in reducing all-cause mortality, improving clinical outcome, and early viral clearance, it should be interpreted cautiously."
