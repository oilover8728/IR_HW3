6241,Case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children presenting as fever and abdominal pain.,"This case aims to remind all providers to scrutinise for atypical presentations of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which may mimic a more routine diagnosis. In the absence of mucocutaneous symptoms, the diagnosis of MIS-C can be missed. Given the potential for rapid deterioration of patients with MIS-C, early treatment and inpatient interventions are necessary."
6242,"A Crowned Killer's Resume: Genome, Structure, Receptors, and Origin of SARS-CoV-2.","The recent emergence and rapid global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose an unprecedented medical and socioeconomic crisis, and the disease caused by it, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Chinese scientists and physicians rapidly identified the causative pathogen, which turned out to be a novel betacoronavirus with high sequence similarities to bat and pangolin coronaviruses. The scientific community has ignited tremendous efforts to unravel the biological underpinning of SARS-CoV-2, which constitutes the foundation for therapy and vaccine development strategies. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the genome, structure, receptor, and origin of SARS-CoV-2."

This is especially so in people who are sensitized to components of the vaccine. This article focuses on practical aspects of diagnostic possibilities, prevention, recognition and therapy of anaphylactic reactions. High-risk population, who should not get vaccinated; as well as people who need allergy diagnostics before vaccinations are discussed. In opinion of allergy experts patients with atopic allergies or venom allergies do not have a higher risk regarding anaphylaxic reaction due to COVID vaccination."

6245,Clinical Findings of COVID-19 Patients at High and Average Altitudes in Saudi Arabia.,"&lt;b&gt;Background and Objective:&lt;/b&gt; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), became a global health issue that influenced the lives of billions of people all over the world. The goal of this study was to investigate the clinical findings and routine laboratory evaluations of COVID-19 patients in both average- and high-altitude settings in Saudi Arabia. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; A comparative study to explore the clinical characteristics and Laboratory tests results of COVID-19 patients at both high and average altitudes in Saudi Arabia has been conducted. The study included a total number of 103 patients (53 patients comprising the high-altitude group living in Taif, Saudi Arabia and 50 patients comprising the average-altitude group living in Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia) were included in the study. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2-positive by PCR test. Clinical characteristics, laboratory test results and symptoms of adult patients were collected and expressed as mean and standard deviation. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software to compare between both groups and significance was considered when the p-value is less than 0.05. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Approximately 55.3% of the total cases were male with a mean age of 40.16±12.47 years. There were highly statistically significant differences between the groups in age, heart rate (p<0.001). There were also statistically significant differences between the groups in temperature, SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, fever, myalgia, shortness of breath and loss of smell and taste. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The current study provides an understanding of the clinical and laboratory investigations of COVID-19 patients in two regions (high altitude and average altitude) in Saudi Arabia."
6246,Report of a series of healthy term newborns from convalescent mothers with COVID-19.,"Background: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmittable virus associated with a significantly increased risk of complications among the infected population. Few data are available for the outcome of pregnancy complicated by serious respiratory disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aim: We herein report a series of four neonates whose mothers had recovered from new coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: pregnant women with documented COVID-19 infection during their pregnancy, who gave birth in Parma Hospital, University of Parma, Italy, in March and April 2020, during the peak of incidence of COVID-19 in Italy. Clinical records and laboratory tests were retrospectively reviewed. Results: All neonates were delivered at term in good conditions without congenital COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: Findings from our series of cases indicated that adverse effects on foetuses from pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 infection in late pregnancy are unlikely."
6247,Radiological diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a Practical Guide.,"Novel beta-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is the cause of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), and on March 12th 2020, the World Health Organization defined COVID-19 as a controllable pandemic. Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be identified by virus isolation or viral nucleic acid detection; however, false negatives associated with the nucleic acid detection provide a clinical challenge. Imaging examination has become the indispensable means not only in the early detection and diagnosis but also in monitoring the clinical course, evaluating the disease severity, and may be presented as an important warning signal preceding the negative RT-PCR test results. Different radiological modalities can be used in different disease settings. Radiology Departments must be nimble in implementing operational changes to ensure continued radiology services and protect patients and staff health."
6248,"Severe, Symptomatic Reinfection in a Patient with COVID-19.","To date, there have only been a few reports of reinfections in COVID-19 patients. The possibility of being reinfected with COVID-19 is poorly understood. In this case report, we describe an individual who was initially diagnosed in April 2020 with COVID-19. Seven months later, he presented again to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have COVID-19 reinfection. We also summarize a list of all known cases of COVID-19 reinfection at this time."
6249,Massive application of the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test: simulation of its effect on the evolution of the epidemic in Spain.,"In Spain, the epidemic curve caused by COVID-19 has reached its peak in the last days of March. The implementation of the blockade derived from the declaration of the state of alarm on 14th March has raised a discussion on how and when to deal with the unblocking. In this paper, we intend to add information that may help by using epidemic simulation techniques with stochastic individual contact models and several extensions."
