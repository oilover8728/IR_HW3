1772,Triage process for the assessment of coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients with cancer: The ONCOVID prospective study.,"Background: Patients with cancer are considered at high risk for the novel respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). General measures to keep COVID-19-free cancer divisions have been adopted worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of triage to identify COVID-19 among patients with cancer. Methods: From March 20 to April 17, 2020, data were collected from patients who were treated or followed at the authors' institution in a prospective clinical trial. The primary endpoint was to estimate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19-positive patients who were identified using a triage process through the aid of medical and patient questionnaires. Based on a diagnostic algorithm, patients with suspect symptoms underwent an infectious disease specialist's evaluation and a COVID-19 swab. Serologic tests were proposed for patients who had symptoms or altered laboratory tests that did not fall into the diagnostic algorithm but were suspicious for COVID-19. Results: Overall, 562 patients were enrolled. Six patients (1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 4 (67%) had the disease detected through telehealth triage, and 2 patients (33%) without suspect symptoms at triage had the disease detected later. Seventy-one patients (13%) had suspect symptoms and/or altered laboratory tests that were not included in the diagnostic algorithm and, of these, 47 patients (73%) underwent testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody: 6 (13%) were positive for IgG (n = 5) or for both IgM and IgG (n = 1), and antibody tests were negative in the remaining 41 patients. Conclusions: The triage process had a positive effect on the detection of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. Telehealth triage was helpful in detecting suspect patients and to keep a COVID-19-free cancer center. The overall incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (1%) and antibody positivity (13%) in patients with suspect symptoms was similar to that observed in the general population."
1773,India's role in COVID-19 vaccine diplomacy.,"Indian vaccine manufacturers such as Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Biological E Limited, Aurobindo Pharma, and Indian Immunologicals have already secured the license to manufacture major vaccine candidates. The ability of the country to manufacture cost-effective COVID-19 vaccines will help to meet the global vaccine requirements."

1775,"Horses for courses? Assessing the potential value of a surrogate, point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2 epidemic control.","Point-of-care tests (POCTs) offer considerable potential for improving clinical and public health management of COVID-19 by providing timely information to guide decision-making, but data on real-world performance are in short supply. Besides SARS-CoV-2-specific tests, there is growing interest in the role of surrogate (non-specific) tests such as FebriDx, a biochemical POCT which can be used to distinguish viral from bacterial infection in patients with influenza-like illnesses. This short report assesses what is currently known about FebriDx performance across settings and populations by comparison with some of the more intensively evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific POCTs. While FebriDx shows some potential in supporting triage for early-stage infection in acute care settings, this is dependent on SARS-CoV-2 being the most likely cause for influenza-like illnesses, with reduction in discriminatory power when COVID-19 case numbers are low, and when co-circulating viral respiratory infections become more prevalent during the autumn and winter. Too little is currently known about its performance in primary care and the community to support use in these contexts, and further evaluation is needed. Reliable SARS CoV2-specific POCTs-when they become available-are likely to rapidly overtake surrogates as the preferred option given the greater specificity they provide."

Concerns about the susceptibility of humans that have already been infected before or those already vaccinated to infection by VOC rise among scientists and clinicians. Herein, we assessed the prevalence of different VOC among recent infections at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). By using a Sanger-based sequencing approach targeting the viral S gene to identify VOC, we have analyzed 72 recent infections. The overall prevalence of VOC was 97%. Among the subjects analyzed, six had been vaccinated with the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 (n = 4; one with two doses and three with one dose) or the CoronaVac (n = 2; both with 2 doses) vaccine, while five subjects represented reinfection cases, being two of them also part of the vaccinated group (each one with one vaccine type). All vaccinated and re-infected subjects carried VOC irrespective of the vaccine type taken, the number of doses taken, IgG titers or being previously infected during the first wave of the Brazilian pandemic. Importantly, all six vaccinees only had mild symptoms. We present here several examples of how natural infections or vaccination may not be fully capable of conferring sterilizing immunity against VOC."
