2250,Comparative analysis of three point-of-care lateral flow immunoassays for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: data from 100 healthcare workers in Brazil.,"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Brazil has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and the second-highest number of recovered patients. SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time RT-PCR is the gold standard but requires a certified laboratory infrastructure with high-cost equipment and trained personnel. However, for large-scale testing, diagnostics should be fast, cost-effective, widely available, and deployed for the community, such as serological tests based on lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) for IgM/IgG detection. We evaluated three different commercial point-of-care (POC) LFIAs for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in capillary whole blood of 100 healthcare workers (HCW) from São Paulo university hospital previously tested by RT-PCR: (1) COVID-19 IgG/IgM BIO (Bioclin, Brazil), (2) Diagnostic Kit for IgM/IgG Antibody to Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Livzon, China), and (3) SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Wondfo, China). A total of 84 positives and 16 negatives HCW were tested. The data was also analyzed by the number of days post symptoms (DPS) in three groups: <30 (n=26), 30-59 (n=42), and >59 (n=16). The observed sensibility was 85.71%, 47.62%, and 44.05% for Bioclin, Wondfo, and Livzon, respectively, with a specificity of 100% for all LFIA. Bioclin was more sensitive (p<0.01), regardless of the DPS. Thus, the Bioclin may be used as a POC test to monitor SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in HCW."
2251,Robust and low-cost ELISA based on IgG-Fc tagged recombinant proteins to screen for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.,"The development of new diagnostic assays become a priority for managing COVID-19. To this aim, we presented here an in-house ELISA based on the production of two major recombinant and high-quality antigens from SARS-CoV-2. Full-length N and S-RBD fragment proteins fused to mouse IgG2a-Fc were produced in the CHO cell line. Secreted recombinant proteins were easily purified with standard Protein A chromatography and were used in an in-house ELISA to detect anti-N and anti-RBD IgGs in the plasma of COVID-19 RTPCR-positive patients. High reactivity against recombinant antigens was readily detected in all positive plasma samples, whereas no recognition was observed with control healthy subject's plasmas. Remarkably, unpurified recombinant N protein obtained from cell culture supernatant was also suitable for the monitoring by ELISA of IgG levels in positive patients. This work provides an early prospection for low price but high-quality serological kit development."
2252,Can Robots Improve Testing Capacity for SARS-CoV-2?,"There is currently increasing interest internationally in deploying robotic applications for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing, as these can help to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to health care staff and patients. We provide an overview of key recent developments in this area. We argue that, although there is some potential for deploying robots to help with SARS-CoV-2 testing, the potential of patient-facing applications is likely to be limited. This is due to the high costs associated with patient-facing functionality, and risks of potentially adverse impacts on health care staff work practices and patient interactions. In contrast, back-end laboratory-based robots dealing with sample extraction and amplification, that effectively integrate with established processes, software, and interfaces to process samples, are much more likely to result in safety and efficiency gains. Consideration should therefore be given to deploying these at scale."

2254,COVID-19 Antibody Prevalence From July to September 2020: One Army Infantry Brigade's Experience.,"Objectives: Lab companies developed serology tests for antibody detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization. Antibody detection uses purified proteins of SARS-CoV-2 to determine antibody binding via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), or colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic assay. With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), nucleic acid amplification technology (NAAT) SARS-CoV-2 testing for active infection was not widely available to healthy, active-duty Soldiers. The purpose of this surveillance survey was to determine the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms of COVID-19 within a mechanized infantry brigade. Materials and methods: Active-duty military Servicemembers (= 18 years) from a mechanized infantry brigade provided serum samples for testing for the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 qualitative antibody test from June to September 2020 at Joint Base Lewis McChord (JBLM). In addition, participants filled out a questionnaire for symptoms and exposure to COVID-19 from January to September 2020. The surveillance team collected and analyzed antibody testing results and questionnaires from participants for antibody positivity rates and symptom prevalence. Results: A total of 264 participants were tested, with one (0.4%) participant testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. On the questionnaire, 144 of 264 (54.5%) endorsed symptoms of COVID-19 from January to September 2020. The most common symptoms were headache (35%), rhinorrhea (34%), cough (35%), and sore throat (31%). A total of 31 respondents (12%) had been quarantined as a trace contact to a COVID-19 positive patient. Conclusions: While there are limitations inherent to SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and the survey, prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is low. In this sample, symptoms for COVID-19 were prevalent with significant days of duty lost. Prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in this sample may be generalizable to the larger brigade. Prevalence of symptoms of possible COVID-19 are not generalizable to the larger brigade. There is utility to further studies of SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in military populations for purposes of vaccination triaging and deployment readiness."
2255,"Multivalent Display of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD Domain) of COVID-19 to Nanomaterial, Protein Ferritin Nanocages.","SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, has a devastating effect on our society, both in terms of quality of life and death rates; hence, there is an urgent need for developing safe and effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. The most promising strategy to fight against this deadly virus is to develop an effective vaccine. Internalization of SARS-CoV-2 into the human host cell mainly occurs through the binding of the coronavirus spike protein (a trimeric surface glycoprotein) to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The spike-ACE2 protein-protein interaction is mediated through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Mutations in the spike RBD can significantly alter interactions with the ACE2 host receptor. Due to its important role in virus transmission, the spike RBD is considered to be one of the key molecular targets for vaccine development. In this study, a spike RBD-based subunit vaccine was designed by utilizing a ferritin protein nanocage as a scaffold. Several fusion protein constructs were designed in silico by connecting the spike RBD via a synthetic linker (different sizes) to different ferritin subunits (H-ferritin and L-ferritin). The stability and the dynamics of the engineered nanocage constructs were tested by extensive molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Based on our MDS analysis, a five amino acid-based short linker (S-Linker) was the most effective for displaying the spike RBD over the surface of ferritin. The behavior of the spike RBD binding regions from the designed chimeric nanocages with the ACE2 receptor was highlighted. These data propose an effective multivalent synthetic nanocage, which might form the basis for new vaccine therapeutics designed against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2."
