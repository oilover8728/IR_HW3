3680,Interim estimates in null models of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.,"Recently released interim numbers from advanced vaccine candidate clinical trials suggest that a COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) of >90% is achievable. However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics are highly heterogeneous and exhibit localized bursts of transmission, which may lead to sharp localized peaks in the number of new cases, often followed by longer periods of low incidence. Here we show that, for interim estimates of VE, these characteristic bursts in SARS-CoV-2 infection may introduce a strong positive bias in VE. Specifically, we generate null models of vaccine effectiveness, i.e., random models with bursts that over longer periods converge to zero VE but that for interim periods frequently produce apparent VE near 100%. As an example, by following the relevant clinical trial protocol, we can reproduce recently reported interim outcomes from an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of an RNA-based vaccine candidate. Thus, to avoid potential random biases in VE, it is suggested that interim estimates on COVID-19 VE should control for the intrinsic inhomogeneity in both SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and reported cases."

3682,Current laboratory diagnostics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Laboratory medicine provides an almost irreplaceable contribution to the diagnostic reasoning and managed care of most human pathologies. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not an exception to this paradigm. Although the relatively recent emergence does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics, some standpoints can be conveyed. First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels. The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far. As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis. The availability of rapid tests for detecting either viral antigens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a potentially viable opportunity for purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, though more information is needed on accuracy and reliability of these portable immunoassays."

3684,[Application of laboratory diagnostic technologies for SARS-CoV-2: current progress and prospect].,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the detection capability has been improving and the detection techniques have been evolving with innovations. qRT- PCR and mNGS, which represent the current mainstay diagnostic technologies, play key roles in disease diagnosis and monitoring of virus variation. The detection technologies based on serum and plasma IgM and IgG antibodies are important for auxiliary diagnosis. RT-LAMP is highly specific for a diagnostic purpose. Digital PCR could quantitatively detect nucleic acid and SHERLOCK has a higher sensitivity. These techniques all have great potential for future development and application for pathogen detection. In this review the authors summarize the basic rationales, technical characteristics and the current application of the SARS-CoV-2 detection techniques."
3685,Factors associated with the willingness and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine from adult subjects in China.,"Aim: We aimed to investigate factors affecting the willingness and acceptance of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among adults in China and sources of knowledge about the vaccine.Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted from September 8th to 15th, 2020, comprising of 23 questions. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with vaccination willingness and acceptance.Results: A total of 983 questionnaires were included and 81.3% of the participants were willing to receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. With a ""bachelor degree or above"" (OR = 0.56, p = 0.020) and believing that the vaccine would not cause SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0.50, p = 0.003) were associated with an increased willingness. Aged :30 years (OR = 0.38, p = 0.001), and believing that the vaccine would not cause SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0.52, p = 0.004) were associated with higher acceptance; while from Henan province (OR = 2.49, p < 0.001), not willing to vaccinate (OR = 3.86, p < 0.001), not suffering from chronic diseases (OR = 2.25, p = 0.013), and thinking it was not safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 (OR = 1.94, p = 0.001) were correlated with a lower acceptance.Conclusions: In conclusion, age, education, and vaccine perception might be key factors affecting the vaccine willingness and acceptance. Triggering positive perception of vaccine, especially by targeting those aged <30 years, or those with below bachelor degree, or without chronic diseases might be key approaches for improving the willingness and acceptance of vaccine in China."
3686,COVID-19: Innovative Antiviral Drugs Required for Long-Term Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Diseases.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had global catastrophic effects on financial markets, jobs and peoples' lives. Future prevention/therapy of COVID-19 will rely heavily on vaccine development and attempts to repurpose drugs previously used for other microbial diseases. Little attention, however, has been paid to possible difficulties and delays in producing these drugs. Sometimes, unfortunately, these endeavours have been politicized and if these two approaches founder in any way or resistance subsequently occurs, then the world will be left once again to the mercy of these devastating viral pandemics. This review, therefore, briefly outlines the challenges in the development of vaccines and repurposed antiviral drugs, which will hopefully lead to new treatments for COVID-19. It also concludes, however, that the armoury against COVID-19 urgently needs to be enlarging due to the potential severity and likely future reoccurrence of new emergent viruses. Therefore, serious consideration is given to alternative ways of preventing and controlling these pathogens that have received scant attention from the media in the present pandemic. The development of innovative, broad-spectrum, antiviral drugs from natural products is therefore particularly advocated with the challenges involved by new regulatory and scientific initiatives."
3687,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-LAMP and molecular beacons.,"Background: Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic, resulting in the need for rapid assays to allow diagnosis and prevention of transmission. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides a gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but instrument costs are high and supply chains are potentially fragile, motivating interest in additional assay methods. Reverse transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) provides an alternative that uses orthogonal and often less expensive reagents without the need for thermocyclers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is typically detected using dyes to report bulk amplification of DNA; however, a common artifact is nonspecific DNA amplification, which complicates detection. Results: Here we describe the design and testing of molecular beacons, which allow sequence-specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes with improved discrimination in simple reaction mixtures. To optimize beacons for RT-LAMP, multiple locked nucleic acid monomers were incorporated to elevate melting temperatures. We also show how beacons with different fluorescent labels can allow convenient multiplex detection of several amplicons in ""single pot"" reactions, including incorporation of a human RNA LAMP-BEAC assay to confirm sample integrity. Comparison of LAMP-BEAC and RT-qPCR on clinical saliva samples showed good concordance between assays. To facilitate implementation, we developed custom polymerases for LAMP-BEAC and inexpensive purification procedures, which also facilitates increasing sensitivity by increasing reaction volumes. Conclusions: LAMP-BEAC thus provides an affordable and simple SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay suitable for population screening; implementation of the assay has allowed robust screening of thousands of saliva samples per week."
3688,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Saint Petersburg, Russia: a population-based study.","Properly conducted serological survey can help determine infection disease true spread. This study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Saint Petersburg, Russia accounting for non-response bias. A sample of adults was recruited with random digit dialling, interviewed and invited for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was corrected with the aid of the bivariate probit model that jointly estimated individual propensity to agree to participate in the survey and seropositivity. 66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and blood samples were obtained from 1,038 participants between May 27 and June 26, 2020. Naïve seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0% (7.2-10.8) by CMIA and 10.5% (8.6-12.4) by ELISA. Correction for non-response decreased estimates to 7.4% (5.7-9.2) and 9.1% (7.2-10.9) for CMIA and ELISA, respectively. The most pronounced decrease in bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing. Seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits. These results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence can be an overestimation. Serosurvey design should attempt to identify characteristics that are associated both with participation and seropositivity."
3689,Queue questions: Ethics of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization.,"The rapid development of vaccines against COVID-19 represents a huge achievement, and offers hope of ending the global pandemic. At least three COVID-19 vaccines have been approved or are about to be approved for distribution in many countries. However, with very limited initial availability, only a minority of the population will be able to receive vaccines this winter. Urgent decisions will have to be made about who should receive priority for access. Current policy in the UK appears to take the view that those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 should get the vaccine first. While this is intuitively attractive, we argue that there are other possible values and criteria that need to be considered. These include both intrinsic and instrumental values. The former are numbers of lives saved, years of life saved, quality of the lives saved, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and possibly others including age. Instrumental values include protecting healthcare systems and other broader societal interests, which might require prioritizing key worker status and having dependants. The challenge from an ethical point of view is to strike the right balance among these values. It also depends on effectiveness of different vaccines on different population groups and on modelling around cost-effectiveness of different strategies. It is a mistake to simply assume that prioritizing the most vulnerable is the best strategy. Although that could end up being the best approach, whether it is or not requires careful ethical and empirical analysis."
