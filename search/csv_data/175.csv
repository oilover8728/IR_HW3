1740,Rapid and cost-effective process based on insect larvae for scale-up production of SARS-COV-2 spike protein for serological COVID-19 testing.,"Serology testing for COVID-19 is important in evaluating active immune response against SARS-CoV-2, studying the antibody kinetics, and monitoring reinfections with genetic variants and new virus strains, in particular, the duration of antibodies in virus-exposed individuals and vaccine-mediated immunity. In this study, recombinant S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was expressed in Rachiplusia nu, an important agronomic plague. One gram of insect larvae produces an amount of S protein sufficient for 150 determinations in the ELISA method herein developed. We established a rapid production process for SARS-CoV-2 S protein that showed immunoreactivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and was used as a single antigen for developing the ELISA method with high sensitivity (96.2%) and specificity (98.8%). Our findings provide an efficient and cost-effective platform for large-scale S protein production, and the scale-up is linear, thus avoiding the use of complex equipment like bioreactors."
1741,"SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, where do we stand?","Vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, represents a major infection control strategy in the absence of effective treatment of the disease to date. Unprecedented mobilization has led to the development of a large number of projects, some of which have already been in test in humans for several months. The first efficacy and safety data are expected in the coming weeks. New vaccine technologies are being evaluated (RNA, replicating or non-replicating viral vectors), further increasing the chances of success. The criteria for evaluating vaccines-despite the exceptional speed of their development-must remain rigorous enough to ensure their acceptance by the population. Beyond their development, mass production and equitable distribution raise many questions. Finally, vaccination can only be successfully implemented if health professionals and the population are convinced of its validity, which implies particular attention to the quality of the information given and the methods of communication."
1742,Comparison of the Quidel Sofia SARS FIA Test to the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA Test for Diagnosis of COVID-19 in Symptomatic Outpatients.,"The Quidel Sofia severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) test (SOFIA) is a rapid antigen immunoassay for the detection of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins from nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the SOFIA test to those of the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA test (APTIMA TMA), a high-throughput molecular diagnostic test that uses transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from upper respiratory tract specimens. Three hundred forty-seven symptomatic patients from an urgent care center in an area with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections were tested in parallel using nasal swabs for the SOFIA test and nasopharyngeal swabs for the APTIMA TMA test. The SOFIA test demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 82.0% with the APTIMA TMA test for symptomatic patients tested ≤5 days from symptom onset and a PPA of 54.5% for symptomatic patients >5 days from symptom onset. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) test was used to determine the cycle threshold (CT ) value for any specimens that were discrepant between the SOFIA and APTIMA TMA tests. Using a CT value of ≤35 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 culture positivity, we estimate that the SOFIA test detected 87.2% of symptomatic patients tested ≤5 days from symptom onset who were likely to be culture positive."
1743,"Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 protect against re-infection during outbreaks in care homes, September and October 2020.","Two London care homes experienced a second COVID-19 outbreak, with 29/209 (13.9%) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive cases (16/103 residents, 13/106 staff). In those with prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 1/88 (1.1%) individuals (antibody positive: 87; RT-PCR-positive: 1) became PCR-positive compared with 22/73 (30.1%) with confirmed seronegative status. After four months protection offered by prior infection against re-infection was 96.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 72.7-99.5%) using risk ratios from comparison of proportions and 96.1% (95% CI: 78.8-99.3%) using a penalised logistic regression model."

1748,The conundrum of current anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has given rise to the urgent need for vaccines and therapeutic interventions to address the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development, and those being distributed currently, have been designed to induce neutralizing antibodies using the spike protein of the virus as an immunogen. However, the immunological correlates of protection against the virus remain unknown. This raises questions about the efficacy of current vaccination strategies. In addition, safety profiles of several vaccines seem inadequate or have not yet been evaluated under controlled experimentation. Here, evidence from the literature regarding the efforts already made to identify the immunological correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized. Furthermore, key biological features of most of the advanced vaccines and considerations regarding their safety and expected efficacy are highlighted."
1749,Predictors of negative first SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR despite final diagnosis of COVID-19 and association with outcome.,"Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is an important tool for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, performance concerns have emerged recently, notably regarding sensitivity. We hypothesized that the clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics of patients with a false-negative first RT-PCR test and a final diagnosis of COVID-19 might differ from those of patients with a positive first RT-PCR test. We conducted a multicenter matched case-control study in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a negative first RT-PCR test were matched to patients with a positive first RT-PCR test on age, sex, and initial admission unit (ward or intensive care). We included 80 cases and 80 controls between March 30, and June 22, 2020. Neither mortality at hospital discharge nor hospital stay length differed between the two groups (P = 0.80 and P = 0.54, respectively). By multivariate analysis, two factors were independently associated with a lower risk of a first false-negative test, namely, headache (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.07; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.01-0.49]; P = 0.007) and fatigue/malaise (aOR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.81; P = 0.027); two other factors were independently associated with a higher risk of a first false-negative test, namely, platelets > 207·103 mm-3 (aOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.10-13.16]; P = 0.034) and C-reactive protein > 79.8 mg·L-1 (aOR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.21-13.19; P = 0.023). Patients with suspected COVID-19 whose laboratory tests indicating marked inflammation were at higher risk of a first false-negative RT-PCR test. Strategies involving serial RT-PCR testing must be rigorously evaluated."
