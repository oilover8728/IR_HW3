2842,Study presence of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) in the sweat of patients infected with Covid-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease, which started in Wuhan, Chin, has now become a public health challenge in most countries around the world. Proper preventive measures are necessary to prevent the spread of the virus to help control the pandemic. Because, SARS-CoV-2 is new, its transmission route has not been fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the sweat secretion of COVID-19 patients. Sweat specimens of 25 COVID- 19 patients were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method. After RNA extraction and cDNA amplification, all samples were examined for the presence of ORF-1ab and N genes related to COVID-19. Results annotated by Realtime PCR machines software based on Dynamic algorithm. The results of this study showed the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in the sweat samples taken from the foreheads of infected people. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sweat of patients with COVID- 19 cannot transmit SARS-CoV-2. However they can be easily contaminated with other body liquids."
2843,Evaluation of extraction and amplification assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at Auckland Hospital laboratory during the COVID-19 outbreak in New Zealand.,"Utilising diverse molecular platforms has formed a solid foundation in New Zealand's COVID-19 response. We evaluated multiple extraction and PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We included 65 positive samples which were run on the Panther Fusion using a laboratory developed test (LDT, E gene target). Where viral RNA was extracted by MagNA Pure (MP) 96 extraction platform or EpMotion 5075/Geneaid extraction kit, SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed on Light Cycler (LC) 480 using a LDT (E gene) or 3 commercial assays; Certest Viasure (Orf1ab, N genes) GenePro (E, RdRp genes) and A* Star Fortitude (proprietary target). Median Cts on LC 480 LDT for specimens (n = 9) extracted on MP 96 (26.6) were lower than on EpMotion (31.6) whereas median Cts for specimens (n = 10) extracted on the Panther Fusion LDT (23.1) were comparable with MP 96 /LC480 LDT (23.6). Specimens tested on Panther Fusion LDT (n = 28), extracted by MP 96, and amplified using commercial assays showed good concordance with a few exceptions; lower median Ct values were seen for 2 targets on GenePro (16.9, 21.5) and Viasure (19.5, 21.1) than for the Panther Fusion LDT (24.2) and A* Star Fortitude (25.6). Specimens tested on MP 96 (n = 18) had comparable results using commercial assays, with lower median Cts for Viasure (22.2, 23.7) compared with the LC 480 LDT (24.7), GenePro (24.7,25.7) and A*Fortitude (25.1) assays. The study provides an early assessment of the performance characteristics of 3 extraction methods for viral RNA and 5 PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2."
2844,A computational simulation platform for designing real-time monitoring systems with application to COVID-19.,"With the aim of contributing to the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), numerous strategies have been proposed. While developing an effective vaccine can take months up to years, detection of infected patients seems like one of the best ideas for controlling the situation. The role of biosensors in containing highly pathogenic viruses, saving lives and economy is evident. A new competitive numerical platform specifically for designing microfluidic-integrated biosensors is developed and presented in this work. Properties of the biosensor, sample, buffer fluid and even the microfluidic channel can be modified in this model. This feature provides the scientific community with the ability to design a specific biosensor for requested point-of-care (POC) applications. First, the validation of the presented numerical platform against experimental data and then results and discussion, highlighting the important role of the design parameters on the performance of the biosensor is presented. For the latter, the baseline case has been set on the previous studies on the biosensors suitable for SARS-CoV, which has the highest similarity to the 2019 nCoV. Subsequently, the effects of concentration of the targeted molecules in the sample, installation position and properties of the biosensor on its performance were investigated in 11 case studies. The presented numerical framework provides an insight into understanding of the virus reaction in the design process of the biosensor and enhances our preparation for any future outbreaks. Furthermore, the integration of biosensors with different devices for accelerating the process of defeating the pandemic is proposed."
2845,Collaboration in times of crisis: A study on COVID-19 vaccine R&D partnerships.,"Collaboration is central for initiatives and efforts in the race to fight COVID-19, with particular focus on fostering rapid development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. We investigated the types of partnerships that have emerged during the pandemic to develop these products. Using the World Health Organization's list of COVID-19 vaccine developments, we found nearly one third of all vaccine candidates were developed by partnerships, which tended to use next-gen vaccine platforms more than solo efforts. These partnerships vary substantially between materials-transfer partnerships and knowledge-sharing partnerships. The difference is important: The type of sharing between partners not only shapes the collaboration, but also bears implications for knowledge and technology development in the field and more broadly. Policies promoting fair and effective collaboration and knowledge-sharing are key for public health to avoid stumbling blocks for vaccine development, deployment, and equitable access, both for COVID-19 and expected future pandemics."
2846,Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.,"There have recently been safety concerns regarding an increased risk of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) following administration of SARS-CoV-2 adenoviral vector vaccines. The Southern African Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis reviewed the emerging literature on this idiosyncratic complication. A draft document was produced and revised by consensus agreement by a panel of professionals from various specialties. The recommendations were adjudicated by independent international experts to avoid local bias. We present concise, practical guidelines for the clinical management of VITT."
2847,[Audiological profile of patients with SARS-Co-V-2 PCR-positive cases].,"COVID-19 is a new pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 11 February 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients may vary, more often include symptoms affected by upper and lower respiratory tract damage. In ENT practice it is used to mention rhinitis, sore throat, anosmia/hyposmia. The effect of COVID-19 is an interesting issue in audiology. There were 78 patients who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 PCR-positive cases and 30 normal non-infected subjects in our study. The patients were divided into two groups according to severity their clinical symptoms from asymptomatic COVID-19 PCR-positive cases to severe form. All patients underwent audiological evaluation included tympanometry, acoustic threshold and transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE). Although hearing sensitivity was normal among some participants, it was statistically proved that TEOAEs could pick up subtle deterioration in the outer hair cells functions and impact on the cochlear."
