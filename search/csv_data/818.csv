8170,TSP-based PCR for rapid identification of L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: In the initial few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, two distinct strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) were identified (L and S strain) based on a tightly linked SNP between two widely separated nucleotides at location 8782 (ORF1ab T8517C) and position 28,144 (ORF8: C251T, codon S84L). Materials and methods: A Type Specific Primer based one step RT-PCR (TSP-PCR) test to distinguish the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for viral genome sequencing, was developed. The study also analyzed 18,221 whole genome sequences (WGS) available up to April 2020 to know the prevalence of L and S type of strains. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome with nearest animal and human coronaviruses were analyzed using MEGA X and SimPlot version 3.5.1 software respectively. Results: The rapid TSP-PCR distinguished the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 by amplifying a specific 326 bp and 256 bp fragment of the L and S type strain respectively. The test was used to analyzed 120 random SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from Assam, India among which 118 were found to be of L-type strains only. On analysis of 18,221 WGS, it was found that L type was the predominant strain with an overall prevalence ∼90%. However, pockets of high prevalence of S-type strains (>35%) were still in circulation in Washington region in April 2020. The study did not detect any significant recombination events between closely related coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: TSP-based PCR for identification of circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2, will add in rapid identification of strains of COVID-19 pandemic to understand the spread of the virus, its transmissibility and adaptation into human population. Though, the S-type strains have decreased drastically across the globe since April 2020, the role of TSP-PCR in geographical niches where such strains are still prevalent may help in rapidly distinguishing the strains and study its evolution."
8171,[The role of ophthalmology in the COVID-19 pandemic].,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has led to a worldwide pandemic. This pandemic presents a huge challenge for the healthcare system and also for ophthalmologists. Previous studies and case reports indicated that SARS-CoV‑2 also infects the conjunctiva resulting in conjunctivitis. In addition, infectious virus particles in the tear fluid can be potential sources of infection; however, the detection of SARS-CoV‑2 RNA in the tear fluid has rarely been successful. Although isolated conjunctival involvement is highly unlikely, at the current point in time of the COVID-19 pandemic, practically every patient examined by an ophthalmologist could be infected with SARS-CoV‑2. Therefore, protective and hygiene measures should currently be consistently followed to minimize the risk of spreading the virus. Currently, there are no treatment recommendations for conjunctivitis associated with COVID-19. Tear substitutes might be helpful for symptom relief but there is no evidence for a topical antiviral therapy. In the future ophthalmologists could play a decisive role in the screening of maculopathies that might occur during COVID-19 treatment using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine."
8172,Recombinant vaccines for COVID-19.,"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has imposed a major public health threat, which needs effective therapeutics and vaccination strategies. Several potential candidate vaccines being rapidly developed are in clinical evaluation. Considering the crucial role of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein in virus attachment, entry, and induction of neutralizing antibodies, S protein is being widely used as a target for vaccine development. Based on advances in techniques for vaccine design, inactivated, live-vectored, nucleic acid, and recombinant COVID-19 vaccines are being developed and tested for their efficacy. Phase3 clinical trials are underway or will soon begin for several of these vaccines. Assuming that clinical efficacy is shown for one or more vaccines, safety is a major aspect to be considered before deploying such vaccines to the public. The current review focuses on the recent advances in recombinant COVID-19 vaccine research and development and associated issues."
8173,Susceptibility of livestock and companion animals to COVID-19.,"While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to wreak havoc, there is little known about the susceptibility of the livestock and companion animals relative to humans. Here, we explore the susceptibility of companion and agricultural animals, in light of the existing information on natural infections, experimental infections, serosurveillance, and in vitro protein-homology binding interaction studies of the SARS-CoV-2 with the proposed receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 from diverse animal species."
8174,Factors influencing nursing students' intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination: A pooled analysis of seven European countries.,"Background: Experiencing the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, high vaccination coverage by a safe and effective vaccine globally would be a great achievement. Acceptance of vaccination by nursing students is an important issue as they play a decisive role as future professionals in educating patients, counselling, and guiding them to the right clinical decision. Objectives: To explore the intention of nursing students to get vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the factors acting either as motivators or as barriers towards vaccination. Design: A multicenter cross-sectional design. Participants: In total 2249 undergraduate nursing students participated. Methods: The study was conducted in 7 universities in participating countries (Greece, Albania, Cyprus, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, and Kosovo) through a web survey. Data was collected during December 2020-January 2021 in all countries. Results: Forty three point 8% of students agreed to accept a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, while the acceptance was higher among Italian students. The factors for intention to get vaccinated were male gender (p = 0.008), no working experience in healthcare facilities during the pandemic (p = 0.001), vaccination for influenza in 2019 and 2020 (p < 0.001), trust in doctors (p < 0.001), governments and experts (p = 0.012), high level of knowledge (p < 0.001) and fear of COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Understanding of factors that influence students' decision to accept COVID-19 vaccination could increase the acceptance rate contributing to a management of the pandemic."

8178,Clinical characteristics of 161 cases of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Changsha.,"Objective: In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus-infected pneumonia broke out in Wuhan and spread rapidly to other parts of the country. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the confirmed cases of COVID-19, who were admitted to the North Hospital of Changsha first Hospital (Changsha Public Health treatment Center) from January 17 to February 7, 2020. Results: The median age of COVID-19 patients was 45 years (range 33.5-57). The male patients accounted for 49.7%, 64.6% of the patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan, and 31.7% had family aggregation. The median days of onset were six, and the incidence of severe illness was 18.6%. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group showed statistical significance in older age, hypertension, bilateral lung plaque shadow, decrease in lymphocyte count, increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. Conclusions: Age, combined hypertension, oxygenation index, double lung patch, decreased lymphocyte count, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase can be used as predictors of the disease severity."
8179,Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV): Designing Master Protocols for Evaluation of Candidate COVID-19 Therapeutics.,"Working in an unprecedented time frame, the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership developed and launched 9 master protocols between 14 April 2020 and 31 May 2021 to allow for the coordinated and efficient evaluation of multiple investigational therapeutic agents for COVID-19. The ACTIV master protocols were designed with a portfolio approach to serve the following patient populations with COVID-19: mild to moderately ill outpatients, moderately ill inpatients, and critically ill inpatients. To facilitate the execution of these studies and minimize start-up time, ACTIV selected several existing networks to launch the master protocols. The master protocols were also designed to test several agent classes prioritized by ACTIV that covered the spectrum of the disease pathophysiology. Each protocol, either adaptive or pragmatic, was designed to efficiently select those treatments that provide benefit to patients while rapidly eliminating those that were either ineffective or unsafe. The ACTIV Therapeutics-Clinical Working Group members describe the process by which these master protocols were designed, developed, and launched. Lessons learned that may be useful in meeting the challenges of a future pandemic are also described."
