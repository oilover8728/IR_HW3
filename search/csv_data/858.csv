8570,Adapting the Motors of Influenza Vaccination Acceptance Scale into the Motors of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale: Psychometric evaluation among mainland Chinese university students.,"Background: COVID-19 continues to ravage the world with economies and life significantly and negatively affected. Fortunately, there has been significant progress in the production of vaccines to stem the infection. However, with controversies and myths surrounding vaccinations, it is timely to examine individuals' willingness to vaccinate. The present study adapted the Motors of Influenza Vaccination Acceptance Scale (MoVac-Flu Scale) into the Motors of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale (MoVac-COVID19S) for validation and assessed the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination utilizing the cognitive model of empowerment (CME). Methods: A total of 3145 university students (mean age = 20.80 years; SD = 2.09) were recruited for the present study between January 5 and 16, 2021. Two MoVac-COVID19S scales (9-item and 12-item) were adapted from the MoVac-Flu Scale, an instrument developed using CME. Psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain reliability and validity properties. Results: The findings indicated that the MoVac-COVID19S had high internal consistency in both the 9-item version (ω = 0.921) and 12-item version (ω = 0.898). The factor structure of the MoVac-COVID19S (9-item and 12-item versions) corresponded well with CME theory. All the fit indices were satisfactory (comparative fit index = 0.984, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.971, root mean square error of approximation = 0.088, standardized root mean square residual = 0.058) but the 9-item MoVac-COVID had better fit indices than the 12-item MoVac-COVID due to the negative wording effects existing in the 12-item MoVac-COVID19S. The scale had satisfactory known-group validity in both 9-item and 12-item versions. Conclusions: The MoVac-COVID19S has promising psychometric properties based on internal consistency, factor structure, and known-group validity."
8571,Molecular Dynamics Studies on the Structural Characteristics for the Stability Prediction of SARS-CoV-2.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects the COVID-19 pandemic in the world. The spike protein of the various proteins encoded in SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2, fuses, and enters human cells in the respiratory system. Spike protein, however, is highly variable, and many variants were identified continuously. In this study, Korean mutants for spike protein (D614G and D614A-C terminal domain, L455F and F456L-RBD, and Q787H-S2 domain) were investigated in patients. Because RBD in spike protein is related to direct interaction with ACE2, almost all researches were focused on the RBD region or ACE2-free whole domain region. The 3D structure for spike protein complexed with ACE2 was recently released. The stability analysis through RBD distance among each spike protein chain and the binding free energy calculation between spike protein and ACE2 were performed using MD simulation depending on mutant types in 1-, 2-, and 3-open-complex forms. D614G mutant of CT2 domain, showing to be the most prevalent in the global pandemic, showed higher stability in all open-complex forms than the wild type and other mutants. We hope this study will provide an insight into the importance of conformational fluctuation in the whole domain, although RBD is involved in the direct interaction with ACE2."
8572,Review of the Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"In late December 2019, a cluster of cases with 2019 Novel Coronavirus pneumonia (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, aroused worldwide concern. Previous studies have reported epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this brief review is to summarize those published studies as of late February 2020 on the clinical features, symptoms, complications, and treatments of COVID-19 and help provide guidance for frontline medical staff in the clinical management of this outbreak."

8574,Optical Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Utilizing Antigen-Antibody Binding Interactions.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, is sweeping the world today. This study investigates the optical detection of SARS-CoV-2, utilizing the antigen-antibody binding interactions utilizing a light source from a smart phone and a portable spectrophotometer. The proof-of-concept is shown by detecting soluble preparations of spike protein subunits from SARS-CoV-2, followed by detection of the actual binding potential of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins with their corresponding antigens. The measured binding interactions for RBD and NCP proteins with their corresponding antibodies under different conditions have been measured and analyzed. Based on these observations, a ""hump or spike"" in light intensity is observed when a specific molecular interaction takes place between two proteins. The optical responses could further be analyzed using the principle component analysis technique to enhance and allows precise detection of the specific target in a multi-protein mixture."

8576,Predictive Computed Tomography and Clinical Features for Diagnosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia: Compared With Common Viral Pneumonia.,"Objective: To determine the predictive computed tomography (CT) and clinical features for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: The CT and clinical data including were analyzed using univariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression, followed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: The factors including size of ground grass opacity (GGO), GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening, vascular enlargement, ""tree-in-bud"" opacity, centrilobular nodules, and stuffy or runny nose were associated with the 2 groups of viral pneumonia, as determined by univariate analysis (P < 0.05). Only GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening, centrilobular nodules, and stuffy or runny nose remained independent risk factors in multinomial logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under curve of the obtained logistic regression model was 0.893. Conclusion: Computed tomography and clinical features including GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening, absence of centrilobular nodules, and absence of stuffy or runny nose are potential patients with COVID-19 pneumonia."

8578,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Surveillance in Decedents in a Large, Urban Medical Examiner's Office.","Background: Given the challenges in implementing widespread testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is increasing interest in alternative surveillance strategies. Methods: We tested nasopharyngeal swabs from 1094 decedents in the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office for SARS-CoV-2. All decedents were assessed using a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) checklist, and decedents flagged using the checklist (298) were preferentially tested. A random sample of decedents not flagged using the checklist were also tested (796). We statistically analyzed the characteristics of decedents (age, sex, race, and manner of death), differentiating between those flagged using the checklist and not and between those SARS-CoV-2-positive and not. Results: A larger percentage of decedents overall were male (70% vs 48%) and black (55% vs 36%) compared with the catchment population. Seven-day average percent positivity among flagged decedents closely matched the trajectory of percent positivity in the catchment population, particularly during the peak of the outbreak (March and April 2020). After a lull in May to mid-June, new positive tests in late June coincided with increased case detection in the catchment. We found large racial disparities in test results; SARS-CoV-2-positive decedents were substantially more likely to be black than SARS-CoV-2-negative decedents (82% vs 51%). SARS-CoV-2-positive decedents were also more likely to be older and to have died of natural causes, including of COVID-19 disease. Conclusions: Disease surveillance through medical examiners and coroners could supplement other forms of surveillance and serve as a possible early outbreak warning sign."
8579,Convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 critically ill patients during advanced phases of clinical trials and their preliminary results.,"The objective of this study was to highlight the global scientific effort to fight the SARS-CoV-2, addressing the preliminary results of passive immunization through convalescent plasma. We performed a search at the major databases of interventional clinical trial protocols about the transfusion of convalescent plasma in patients with COVID-19, as well as, published articles (n≥25), using the following search strategy: [(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR nCoV-2019) AND (Convalescent plasma OR Plasma exchange) AND (Treatment OR Therapy)]. A total of 24 interventional clinical trial protocols (advanced in phases II-III, III, and IV) were included in this review, as well as three studies that had enough outcomes to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy for patients with COVID-19. All interventional clinical trial protocols applied approximately 500mL of convalescent plasma (from single or more donations) in hospitalized patients, mainly in patients with severe disease associated with standard therapy for COVID-19, and compared to placebo or standard therapy plus specific drugs. Most of interventional clinical trial protocols are multicenter, and the phase IV studies are recruiting at intercontinental centers of North America, Oceania, Europe, but most are recruiting center inside their own county. The three studies published reported similar approach of convalescent plasma intervention with decrease in length of stay, mortality, with less than 4% of adverse events, mainly for treating critical cases with life-threatening disease. All advanced clinical trials focused on convalescent plasma therapy in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in severe conditions, and the preliminary results provide strong evidence for therapy for the COVID-19 patients."
