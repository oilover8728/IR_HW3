1381,Validation Study for VERIPRO SARS-CoV-2 Env Assay for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Stainless-Steel Environmental Surface Swabs: Emergency Response Validation-AOAC Performance Tested MethodSM 122001.,"Background: The VERIPRO® SARS-CoV-2 Env assay uses reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, from stainless-steel environmental sample swabs. Objective: To validate the VERIPRO SARS-CoV-2 Env assay as part of the AOAC Research Institute's Emergency Response Validation Performance Tested Method(s)SM program. Method: The VERIPRO SARS-CoV-2 Env assay was evaluated for specificity using in silico analysis of 15 764 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and 65 exclusivity organisms (both near neighbors and background organisms). The candidate method was evaluated in an unpaired study design for one environmental surface (stainless steel) and compared to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, Instructions for Use (Revision 4, Effective 6/12/2020). Results: Results of the in silico analysis demonstrate the specificity of the method in being able to detect target sequences and discriminate them from near neighbors. In the matrix study, the candidate method demonstrated statistically significant better recovery of the target analyte than the reference method. Conclusions: The VERIPRO SARS-CoV-2 Env assay is a rapid and accurate method that can be utilized by food producers to detect the causative agent of COVID-19 on food contact surfaces. Highlights: The VERIPRO SARS-CoV-2 Env assay can be performed without the need for an optional RNA purification step to detect SARS-CoV-2 from environmental surfaces."
1382,"Minimal SARS-CoV-2 Transmission After Implementation of a Comprehensive Mitigation Strategy at a School - New Jersey, August 20-November 27, 2020.","During fall 2020, many U.S. kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) schools closed campuses and instituted remote learning to limit in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1,2). A New Jersey grade 9-12 boarding school with 520 full-time resident students, 255 commuter students, and 405 faculty and staff members implemented a comprehensive mitigation strategy that included universal masking, testing, upgraded air-handling equipment to improve ventilation, physical distancing of ≥6 ft, contact tracing, and quarantine and isolation protocols to prevent and control transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among students, faculty, and staff members. Mandatory twice-weekly screening using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of all students and staff members during August 20-November 27, 2020, resulted in the testing of 21,449 specimens. A total of 19 (5%) of 405 faculty and staff members and eight (1%) of 775 students received positive test results; only two identified cases were plausibly caused by secondary transmission on campus. Comprehensive mitigation approaches including frequent testing and universal masking can help prevent outbreaks in in-person high school settings even when community transmission is ongoing."
1383,A review: Antibody-dependent enhancement in COVID-19: The not so friendly side of antibodies.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents an unprecedented global public health emergency with economic and social consequences. One of the main concerns in the development of vaccines is the antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon, better known as ADE. In this review, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the immune response generated by the host. On the bases of this principle, we also describe what is known about the ADE phenomenon in various viral infections and its possible role as a limiting factor in the development of new vaccines and therapeutic strategies."
1384,Progression and Predictors of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Seroreactivity In US Blood Donors.,"The second largest US blood center began testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) to identify potential COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) donors and encourage blood donation. We report the non-vaccine seroprevalence of total immunoglobulin directed against the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in our donors. Unique non-CCP donor sera from June 01to December 31, 2020 were tested with the Ortho VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin assay (reactive: signal-to-cutoff (S/C) ≥ 1). Multivariate regressions including age, sex, race-ethnicity, ABO, RhD, highest education level, donor experience, regional collection center and drive type factors were conducted to identify demographics associated with the presence of antibodies and with S/C values. Unique donors (n = 523,068) showed an overall seroprevalence of 6.12% over 7 months, with the highest prevalence in December 2020 around Lubbock, TX (24.3%). In a subset of donors with demographic information (n = 394,470), lower odds of antibody reactivity were associated with female sex, non-Hispanic White or Asian race/ethnicity, age ≥ 65, graduate education, blood Group O, and history of blood donation. In reactive donors (n = 24,028), antibody signal was associated with male sex, race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic White, low educational attainment, age 16-17 years and geographic location. Seroprevalence continues to grow in US blood donors but varies significantly by region. Temporal trends in reactivity may be useful to estimate effectiveness of public health measures. Before generalizing these data from healthy donors to the general population, rates must be corrected for false-positive test results and adjusted to match the wider US demography."
1385,Performance of 30 commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assays in testing symptomatic COVID-19 patients.,"We report evaluation of 30 assays' (17 rapid tests (RDTs) and 13 automated/manual ELISA/CLIA assay (IAs)) clinical performances with 2594 sera collected from symptomatic patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR on a respiratory sample, and 1996 pre-epidemic serum samples expected to be negative. Only 4 RDT and 3 IAs fitted both specificity (> 98%) and sensitivity (> 90%) criteria according to French recommendations. Serology may offer valuable information during COVID-19 pandemic, but inconsistent performances observed among the 30 commercial assays evaluated, which underlines the importance of independent evaluation before clinical implementation."
1386,Various theranostics and immunization strategies based on nanotechnology against Covid-19 pandemic: An interdisciplinary view.,"COVID-19 pandemic is still a major risk to human civilization. Besides the global immunization policy, more than five lac new cases are documented everyday. Some countries newly implement partial/complete nationwid lockdown to mitigate recurrent community spreading. To avoid the new modified stain of SARS-CoV-2 spreading, some countries imposed any restriction on the movement of the citizens within or outside the country. Effective economical point of care diagnostic and therapeutic strategy is vigorously required to mitigate viral spread. Besides struggling with repurposed medicines, new engineered materials with multiple unique efficacies and specific antiviral potency against SARS-CoV-2 infection may be fruitful to save more lives. Nanotechnology-based engineering strategy sophisticated medicine with specific, effective and nonhazardous delivery mechanism for available repurposed antivirals as well as remedial for associated diseases due to malfeasance in immuno-system e.g. hypercytokinaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome. This review will talk about gloomy but critical areas for nanoscientists to intervene and will showcase about the different laboratory diagnostic, prognostic strategies and their mode of actions. In addition, we speak about SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, pathogenicity and host specific interation with special emphasis on altered immuno-system and also perceptualized, copious ways to design prophylactic nanomedicines and next-generation vaccines based on recent findings."

1388,Evaluating 10 Commercially Available SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Serological Tests by Use of the STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) Method.,"Numerous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapid serological tests have been developed, but their accuracy has usually been assessed using very few samples, and rigorous comparisons between these tests are scarce. In this study, we evaluated and compared 10 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests using the STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) methodology. Two hundred fifty serum samples from 159 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (collected 0 to 32 days after the onset of symptoms) were tested with rapid serological tests. Control serum samples (n = 254) were retrieved from pre-coronavirus disease (COVID) periods from patients with other coronavirus infections (n = 11), positivity for rheumatoid factors (n = 3), IgG/IgM hyperglobulinemia (n = 9), malaria (n = 5), or no documented viral infection (n = 226). All samples were tested using rapid lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) from 10 manufacturers. Only four tests achieved ≥98% specificity, with the specificities ranging from 75.7% to 99.2%. The sensitivities varied by the day of sample collection after the onset of symptoms, from 31.7% to 55.4% (days 0 to 9), 65.9% to 92.9% (days 10 to 14), and 81.0% to 95.2% (>14 days). Only three of the tests evaluated met French health authorities' thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 serological tests (≥90% sensitivity and ≥98% specificity). Overall, the performances varied greatly between tests, with only one-third meeting acceptable specificity and sensitivity thresholds. Knowledge of the analytical performances of these tests will allow clinicians and, most importantly, laboratorians to use them with more confidence; could help determine the general population's immunological status; and may help diagnose some patients with false-negative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) results."
