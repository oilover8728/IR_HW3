8630,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibodies, Faroe Islands.","We conducted a nationwide study of the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the Faroe Islands. Of 1,075 randomly selected participants, 6 (0.6%) tested seropositive for antibodies to the virus. Adjustment for test sensitivity and specificity yielded a 0.7% prevalence. Our findings will help us evaluate our public health response."
8631,"SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 expression, and systemic organ invasion.","A novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has created a global pandemic in 2020, posing an enormous challenge to healthcare systems and affected communities. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) that manifests as bronchitis, pneumonia, or a severe respiratory illness. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells via binding a ""spike"" protein on its surface to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) within the host. ACE2 is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in humans. The RAAS is paramount for normal function in multiple organ systems including the lungs, heart, kidney, and vasculature. Given that SARS-CoV-2 internalizes via ACE2, the resultant disruption in ACE2 expression can lead to altered tissue function and exacerbate chronic diseases. The widespread distribution and expression of ACE2 across multiple organs is critical to our understanding of the varied clinical outcomes of COVID-19. This perspective review based on the current literature was prompted to show how disruption of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 can affect different organ systems."
8632,Eco-Environmental Aspects of COVID-19 Pandemic and Potential Control Strategies.,"A new coronavirus-strain from a zoonotic reservoir (probably bat)-termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-has recently claimed more than two million deaths worldwide. Consequently, a burst of scientific reports on epidemiology, symptoms, and diagnosis came out. However, a comprehensive understanding of eco-environmental aspects that may contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread is still missing, and we therefore aim to focus here on these aspects. In addition to human-human direct SARS-CoV-2 transmission, eco-environmental sources, such as air aerosols, different public use objects, hospital wastes, livestock/pet animals, municipal wastes, ventilation facilities, soil and groundwater potentially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Further, high temperature and humidity were found to limit the spread of COVID-19. Although the COVID-19 pandemic led to decrease air and noise pollution during the period of lockdown, increased use of masks and gloves is threatening the environment by water and soil pollutions. COVID-19 badly impacted all the socio-economic groups in different capacities, where women, slum dwellers, and the people lacking social protections are the most vulnerable. Finally, sustainable strategies, waste management, biodiversity reclaim, eco-friendly lifestyle, improved health infrastructure and public awareness, were proposed to minimize the COVID-19 impact on our society and environment. These strategies will seemingly be equally effective against any future outbreak."
8633,Topical Oral and Intranasal Antiviral Agents for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"With the largest viral loads in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) present in the oral and nasal cavities, agents that act on these two areas have the potential for large therapeutic and prophylactic benefit. A literature review was conducted to elucidate the possible agents useful in treatment of SARS-CoV-2. These agents were evaluated for their current applications, adverse reactions, their current state of study, and any future considerations in their management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Our review has found that, while there are many promising agents with proven efficacy in their in-vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, more clinical trials and in-vivo studies, as well as safety trials, must be conducted before these agents can be effectively implemented."
8634,MUC1-C influences cell survival in lung adenocarcinoma Calu-3 cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may increase the risk of adverse outcomes in lung cancer patients. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of mucin 1 (MUC1) after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung epithelial cancer cell line Calu-3. MUC1 is a major constituent of the mucus layer in the respiratory tract and contributes to pathogen defense. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) expression in a STAT3 activation-dependent manner. Inhibition of MUC1-C signaling increased apoptosis-related protein levels and reduced proliferation-related protein levels; however, SARS-CoV-2 replication was not affected. Together, these results suggest that increased MUC1-C expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger the growth of lung cancer cells, and COVID-19 may be a risk factor for lung cancer patients.

8635,Evaluation of potential anti-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) drugs against the newly emerged model of COVID-19 RdRP using computational methods.,"Introduction: Despite all the efforts to treat COVID-19, no particular cure has been found for this virus. Since developing antiviral drugs is a time-consuming process, the most effective approach is to evaluate the approved and under investigation drugs using in silico methods. Among the different targets within the virus structure, as a vital component in the life cycle of coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) can be a critical target for antiviral drugs. The impact of the existence of RNA in the enzyme structure on the binding affinity of anti-RdRP drugs has not been investigated so far. Methods: In this study, the potential anti-RdRP effects of a variety of drugs from two databases (Zinc database and DrugBank) were evaluated using molecular docking. For this purpose, the newly emerged model of COVID-19 (RdRP) post-translocated catalytic complex (PDB ID: 7BZF) that consists of RNA was chosen as the target. Results: The results indicated that idarubicin (IDR), a member of the anthracycline antibiotic family, and fenoterol (FNT), a known beta-2 adrenergic agonist drug, tightly bind to the target enzyme and could be used as potential anti-RdRP inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These outcomes revealed that due to the ligand-protein interactions, the presence of RNA in this structure could remarkably affect the binding affinity of inhibitor compounds. Conclusion: In silico approaches, such as molecular docking, could effectively address the problem of finding appropriate treatment for COVID-19. Our results showed that IDR and FNT have a significant affinity to the RdRP of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, these drugs are remarkable inhibitors of coronaviruses."
8636,RNA interference as a promising treatment against SARS-CoV-2.,"Until now, there is no current vaccine or treatment against SARS-CoV-2. There are previous successful RNAi studies performed on SARS-CoV. Therefore, similar line of investigation against SARS-CoV-2 could be successful."
8637,"Update of the current knowledge on genetics, evolution, immunopathogenesis, and transmission for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).","In December 2019, an acute respiratory disease caused by novel species of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China and has spread throughout the world. On 11th March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) a pandemic, severe coronavirus-mediated human disease. Based on genomic and phylogenetic studies, SARS-CoV-2 might originate from bat coronaviruses and infects humans directly or through intermediate zoonotic hosts. However, the exact origin or the host intermediate remains unknown. Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to several existing coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV, but differs by silent and non-silent mutations. The virus uses different transmission routes and targets cells and tissues with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which makes it contagious. COVID-19 shares both the main clinical features and excessive/dysregulated cell responses with the two previous Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) epidemics. In this review, we provide an update of the current knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaining a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 structure, transmission routes, and molecular responses, will assist in the prevention and control of COVID-19 outbreaks in the future."
8638,Repurposing CD8(+) T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 for cancer immunotherapy: a positive aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The COVID-19 pandemic has afflicted most countries on the planet. As a result, immunity against SARS-CoV-2, induced via natural infections or imminent vaccinations, is expected to develop in a large fraction of the global population. Here, we propose to exploit SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells for cancer immunotherapy strategies."
8639,[Diagnostic approach and evaluation of hospitalized patients with COVID-19].,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Most patients recover from COVID-19 within a few weeks, but some patients have symptoms lasting for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness, such as fatigue, shortness of breath and cough. This is a review of what we currently know about the clinical disease and its severity as well as which diagnostic strategies are recommended during and after hospital admission."
