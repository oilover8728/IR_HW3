6610,An Outbreak of Covid-19 on an Aircraft Carrier.,"Background: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurred on the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a crew of 4779 personnel. Methods: We obtained clinical and demographic data for all crew members, including results of testing by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). All crew members were followed up for a minimum of 10 weeks, regardless of test results or the absence of symptoms. Results: The crew was predominantly young (mean age, 27 years) and was in general good health, meeting U.S. Navy standards for sea duty. Over the course of the outbreak, 1271 crew members (26.6% of the crew) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by rRT-PCR testing, and more than 1000 infections were identified within 5 weeks after the first laboratory-confirmed infection. An additional 60 crew members had suspected Covid-19 (i.e., illness that met Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists clinical criteria for Covid-19 without a positive test result). Among the crew members with laboratory-confirmed infection, 76.9% (978 of 1271) had no symptoms at the time that they tested positive and 55.0% had symptoms develop at any time during the clinical course. Among the 1331 crew members with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, 23 (1.7%) were hospitalized, 4 (0.3%) received intensive care, and 1 died. Crew members who worked in confined spaces appeared more likely to become infected. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly among the crew of the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. Transmission was facilitated by close-quarters conditions and by asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected crew members. Nearly half of those who tested positive for the virus never had symptoms."
6611,Effect of Opt-In vs Opt-Out Framing on Enrollment in a COVID-19 Surveillance Testing Program: The COVID SAFE Randomized Clinical Trial.,This randomized clinical trial examines the effect of an opt-out recruitment strategy vs a conventional opt-in strategy on enrollment and initial adherence to a COVID-19 surveillance testing program.
6612,Acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy after COVID-19 infection and subsequent ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination.,"SARS-COV-2 predominantly results in a respiratory illness. However, it has also been associated with a wide range of neurological disorders including a broad range of immune neuropathies. These immune neuropathies associated with SARS-COV2 infection include Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), recurrent GBS and exacerbation of pre-existing chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We describe a case with acute-onset CIDP presenting with three relapses of demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, the third relapse occurring in the 8 week of illness following a previous COVID-19 infection and a recent COVID-19 vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and high COVID-19 antibody level. In our knowledge, this is the ever reported case of acute-onset CIDP associated with COVID-19 vaccine and high COVID-19 antibody level."
6613,Increased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection among indigenous people living in the urban area of Manaus.,"The COVID-19 pandemic threatens indigenous peoples living in suburban areas of large Brazilian cities and has thus far intensified their pre-existing socio-economic inequalities. We evaluated the epidemiological situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents of the biggest urban multiethnic indigenous community of the Amazonas state, Brazil. Blood samples of 280 indigenous people living in the surrounding area of Manaus were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA or IgG antibodies. The risk factors and sociodemographic information were assessed through an epidemiological questionnaire. We found a total positivity rate of 64.64% (95% CI 59.01-70.28) for SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgA and IgG were detected in 55.71% (95% CI 49.89-61.54) and 60.71% (95% CI 54.98-66.45) of the individuals, respectively. Over 80% of positive individuals were positive for both IgA and IgG.No significant difference in positivity rates between genders or age groups was observed. Moreover, the age group ≥ 60 years old showed the highest antibody ratios (IgA mean ratio = 3.080 ± 1.623; IgG mean ratio = 4.221 ± 1.832), while the age groups 13-19 and 20-29 showed the lowest IgA (mean ratio = 2.268 ± 0.919) and IgG ratios (mean ratio = 2.207 ± 1.246), respectively. Individuals leaving the home more frequently were at higher risk of infection (Odds ratio (OD) 2.61; 95% CI 1.00-1.49; p = 0.048). Five or more individuals per household increased fivefold the risk of virus transmission (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.09-6.01; p = 0.019). The disproportionate dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed among the study population might be driven by typical cultural behavior and socioeconomic inequalities. Despite the pandemic threat, this population is not being targeted by public policies and appears to be chronically invisible to the Brazilian authorities."
6614,Validation and performance comparison of three SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays.,"Serology testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is increasingly being used during the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although its clinical and epidemiologic utilities are still debatable. Characterizing these assays provides scientific basis to best use them. The current study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo total antibody test) using 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 119 samples with potential cross-reactions, and 1068 negative controls including 942 pre-pandemic samples. SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies became detectable 3-4 days post-symptom onset using SQ IgM test and IgG antibodies were first detected 5-6 days post-onset using SQ IgG. Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total were able to detect antibodies 7 to 8 days post-onset. After 14 days post-symptom onset, the SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total tests were able to detect antibodies from 100% of the PCR-confirmed patients in this series; 87.5% sensitivity for SQ IgM. Overall agreement was 88.5% between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total and 94.6% between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG. No cross-reaction due to recent sera with three of the endemic coronaviruses was observed. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main source of limited cross-reactions. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total, 99.62% for Abbott IgG, and 98.87% for SQ IgM. These findings demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity of appropriately validated SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays with implications for clinical use and epidemiological seroprevalence studies."

6616,N-terminally truncated nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 as a better serological marker than whole nucleocapsid protein in evaluating the immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had led to a serious public health crisis, and no specific treatments or vaccines are available yet. A nucleocapsid protein (NP)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection method is not only important in disease diagnosis, but is required for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy during the development of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this study, we expressed both the NP and N-terminally truncated NP (ΔN-NP) of SARS-CoV-2 in an Escherichia coli expression system and described the purification of the soluble recombinant NP and ΔN-NP in details. The identities of the NP and ΔN-NP were confirmed with mass spectrometry. We then used immunoglobulin G detection ELISAs to compare the sensitivity of NP and ΔN-NP in detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. ΔN-NP showed greater sensitivity than NP in the analysis of serially diluted sera from mice and rabbits vaccinated with inactive SARS-CoV-2 and in human sera diluted 1:400. ΔN-NP showed a positive detection rate similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in human sera. We conclude that ΔN-NP is a better serological marker than NP for evaluating the immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2."

6618,"BCG Vaccine, A Ray of Hope in Treating Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).","In December 2019 in China, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (also 2019 nCoV) was first discovered. Later, WHO declared that SARS-CoV-2 was responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The round, elliptical or pleomorphic shape of the 2019-nCoV is 60-140 nm in diameter. It comprises a single stranded genome of RNA that comprises 29891 nucleotides, a lipid shell and spike protein, envelops membrane, and hemagglutinin- esterase (HE) proteins. Several therapeutic approaches have been proposed to combat this disease as this disease became global pandemic. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine could be another approach and at present, it is the only TB prevention vaccine approved. Both TB and COVID-19 cause severe pneumonia. In this review, we have tried to correlate the pathophysiology of both these disease condition. In this review, we also have shown the history and current BCG practice throughout the world and it is hypothesized that the countries which strictly maintained and made mandatory call to recommend BCG vaccination are relatively less affected by COVID-19 pandemic. When BCG is exposed to a subsequent viral infection, it is allowed to lead to cross-reactive T cell responses, which result in increased activity of Cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 + and Cluster of differentiation (CD) 8 + T cells and this may be a ray of hope in treating the SARS infection."
6619,StackNet-DenVIS: a multi-layer perceptron stacked ensembling approach for COVID-19 detection using X-ray images.,"The highly contagious nature of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) resulted in a global pandemic. Due to the relatively slow and taxing nature of conventional testing for Covid-19, a faster method needs to be in place. The current researches have suggested that visible irregularities found in the chest X-ray of Covid-19 positive patients are indicative of the presence of the disease. Hence, Deep Learning and Image Classification techniques can be employed to learn from these irregularities, and classify accordingly with high accuracy. This research presents an approach to create a classifier model named StackNet-DenVIS which is designed to act as a screening process before conducting the existing swab tests. Using a novel approach, which incorporates Transfer Learning and Stacked Generalization, the model aims to lower the False Negative rate of classification compensating for the 30% False Negative rate of the swab tests. A dataset gathered from multiple reliable sources consisting of 9953 Chest X-rays (868 Covid and 9085 Non-Covid) was used. Also, this research demonstrates handling data imbalance using various techniques involving Generative Adversarial Networks and sampling techniques. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained on our proposed model were 95.07%, 99.40% and 94.61% respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of accuracy and false negative rate obtained by this paper outperforms the current implementations. We must also highlight that our proposed architecture also considers other types of viral pneumonia. Given the unprecedented sensitivity of our model we are optimistic it contributes to a better Covid-19 detection."
