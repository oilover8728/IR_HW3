3810,Immunogenicity of a first dose of mRNA- or vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in dialysis patients: a multicenter prospective observational pilot study.,"Background: Dialysis patients are at risk for lower SARS-CoV-2-vaccine immunogenicity than the normal population. We assessed immunogenicity to a first mRNA- or vector-based SARS-CoV-2-vaccination dose in dialysis patients. Methods: In a multicenter observational pilot study, 2 weeks after a first vaccination (BNT162b2/Pfizer-BioNTech [Comirnaty] or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/Oxford-Astra-Zeneca [Vaxzevria]), hemodialysis patients (N = 23), peritoneal dialysis patients (N = 4) and healthy staff (N = 14) were tested for SARS-CoV-2-spike IgG/IgM, Nucleocapsid-protein-IgG-antibodies and plasma ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity. Hemodialysis patients who had had prior COVID-19 infection (N = 18) served as controls. Both response to first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and IgG spike-positivity following prior COVID-19 infection were defined as SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG levels â‰¥ 50 AU/mL. Results: Vaccination responder rates were 17.4% (4/23) in hemodialysis patients, 100% (4/4) in peritoneal dialysis patients and 57.1% (8/14) in staff (HD vs. PD: p = 0.004, HD vs. staff: p = 0.027). Among hemodialysis patients, type of vaccine (Comirnaty N = 11, Vaxzevria N = 12, 2 responders each) did not appear to influence antibody levels (IgG spike: Comirnaty median 0.0 [1.-3. quartile 0.0-3.8] versus Vaxzevria 4.3 [1.6-20.1] AU/mL, p = 0.079). Of responders to the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among hemodialysis patients (N = 4/23), median IgG spike levels and ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity were lower than that of IgG spike-positive hemodialysis patients with prior COVID-19 infection (13/18, 72.2%): IgG spike: median 222.0, 1.-3. quartile 104.1-721.9 versus median 3794.6, 1.-3. quartile 793.4-9357.9 AU/mL, p = 0.015; ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity: median 11.5%, 1.-3. quartile 5.0-27.3 versus median 74.8%, 1.-3. quartile 44.9-98.1, p = 0.002. Conclusions: Two weeks after their first mRNA- or vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, hemodialysis patients demonstrated lower antibody-related response than peritoneal dialysis patients and healthy staff or unvaccinated hemodialysis patients following prior COVID-19 infection."
3811,"Dealing With Liver Transplantation during Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Normothermic Machine Perfusion Enables for Donor, Organ, and Recipient Assessment: A Case Report.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed life on a global scale. The numbers of transplantations have plummeted as a result of fear of disease transmission, recipient coronavirus disease 2019 infection, priority shift, and resource limitations. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) complicates transplantation because donor testing, (re)allocation of limited resources, and recipient testing may exceed permissible ischemia times. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) helps safely prolong liver preservation up to 38 hours. Additional time is essential under the current circumstances. Here we present the case of a 29-year-old liver transplant recipient in whom prolonged liver preservation required for SARS-CoV-2 screening was accomplished through NMP. Donor and recipient test results for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and intensive care unit capacity was eventually available. The surgical procedure and postoperative course were uneventful. NMP can extend preservation times in liver transplantation while awaiting SARS-CoV-2 test results and available intensive care unit capacity."
3812,3D-printed simulator for nasopharyngeal swab collection for COVID-19.,"Introduction: Testing for COVID-19 is a cornerstone of pandemic control. If conducted inappropriately, nasopharyngeal swab collection can be painful and preanalytical sample collection errors may lead to false negative results. Our objective was to develop a realistic and easily available synthetic simulator for nasopharyngeal swab collection. Materials and methods: The nasopharyngeal swab collection simulator was designed through different development steps: segmentation, computer-aided design (CAD), and 3D printing. The model was 3D printed using PolyJet technology, which allows multi-material printing using hard and soft materials. Results: The simulator splits in the parasagittal plane close to the septum to allow better visualization and understanding of nasal cavity landmarks. The model is able to simulate the softness and texture of different structural elements. The simulator allows the user to conduct realistic nasopharyngeal swab collection. A colored pad on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx provides real-time feedback to the user. The simulator also permits incorrect swab insertion, which is of obvious benefit from a training perspective. Comprehensive 3D files for printing and full instructions for manufacturing the simulator is freely available online via an open access link. Conclusion: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a nasopharyngeal swab collection simulator which can be produced by 3D printing via an open access link, which offers complete operating instructions."
3813,"Interpreting SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, deaths, and fatality rate - Making a case for standardized reporting to improve communication.","The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread across the world, testing each nation's ability to understand the state of the pandemic in their country and control it. As we looked into the epidemiological data to uncover the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we discovered that critical metadata is missing which is meant to give context to epidemiological parameters. In this review, we identify key metadata for the COVID-19 fatality rate after a thorough analysis of mathematical models, serology-informed studies and determinants of causes of death for the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, we find reasons to establish a set of standard-based guidelines to record and report the data from epidemiological studies. Additionally, we discuss why standardizing nomenclature is be a necessary component of these guidelines to improve communication and reproducibility. The goal of establishing these guidelines is to facilitate the interpretation of COVID-19 epidemiological findings and data by the general public, health officials, policymakers and fellow researchers. Our suggestions may not address all aspects of this issue; rather, they are meant to be the foundation for which experts can establish and encourage future guidelines throughout the appropriate communities."
3814,Ovarian follicular function is not altered by SARS-CoV-2 infection or BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.,"Study question: Does the immune response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection or the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine involve the ovarian follicle, and does it affect its function? Summary answer: We were able to demonstrate anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG in follicular fluid (FF) from both infected and vaccinated IVF patients, with no evidence for compromised follicular function. What is known already: No research data are available yet. Study design, size, duration: This is a cohort study, composed of 32 consecutive IVF patients, either infected with COVID-19, vaccinated or non-exposed, conducted between 1 February and 10 March 2021 in a single university hospital-based IVF clinic. Participants/materials, setting, methods: A consecutive sample of female consenting patients undergoing oocyte retrieval was recruited and assigned to one of the three study groups: recovering from confirmed COVID-19 (n = 9); vaccinated (n = 9); and uninfected, non-vaccinated controls (n = 14). Serum and FF samples were taken and analyzed for anti-COVID IgG as well as estrogen, progesterone and heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 concentration, as well as the number and maturity of aspirated oocytes and day of trigger estrogen and progesterone measurements. Main outcome measures were follicular function, including steroidogenesis, follicular response to the LH/hCG trigger, and oocyte quality biomarkers. Main results and the role of chance: Both COVID-19 and the vaccine elicited anti-COVID IgG antibodies that were detected in the FF at levels proportional to the IgG serum concentration. No differences between the three groups were detected in any of the surrogate parameters for ovarian follicle quality. Limitations, reasons for caution: This is a small study, comprising a mixed fertile and infertile population, and its conclusions should be supported and validated by larger studies. Wider implications of the findings: This is the first study to examine the impact of SARS-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination on ovarian function and these early findings suggest no measurable detrimental effect on function of the ovarian follicle. Study funding/competing interest(s): The study was funded out of an internal budget. There are no conflicts of interest for any of the authors. Trial registration number: CinicalTrials.gov registry number NCT04822012."
3815,"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralising antibodies in blood donors from the Lodi Red Zone in Lombardy, Italy, as at 06 April 2020.","We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 RNA and neutralising antibodies in blood donors (BD) residing in the Lodi Red Zone, Italy. Of 390 BDs recruited after 20 February 2020 - when the first COVID-19 case in Lombardy was identified, 91 (23%) aged 19-70 years were antibody positive. Viral RNA was detected in an additional 17 (4.3%) BDs, yielding ca 28% (108/390) with evidence of virus exposure. Five stored samples collected as early as 12 February were seropositive."

3817,Rational use of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests within institutions caring for the vulnerable.,"Institutions such as hospitals and nursing or long-stay residential homes accommodate individuals at considerable risk of mortality should they acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection. In these settings, polymerase chain reaction tests play a central role in infection prevention and control. Here, we argue that both false negative and false positive tests are possible and that careful consideration of the prior probability of infection and of test characteristics are needed to prevent harm. We outline evidence suggesting that regular systematic testing of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals could play an important role in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within institutions. We discuss how such a programme might be organised, arguing that frequent testing and rapid reporting of results are particularly important. We highlight studies demonstrating that polymerase chain reaction testing of pooled samples can be undertaken with acceptable loss of sensitivity, and advocate such an approach where test capacity is limited. We provide an approach to calculating the most efficient pool size. Given the current limitations of tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection, physical distancing and meticulous infection prevention and control will remain essential in institutions caring for vulnerable people."
3818,Clinical Performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test and Simulation of its Real-World Application in Korea.,"The rapid antigen test (RAT) for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents a potent diagnostic method in situations of limited molecular testing resources. However, considerable performance variance has been reported with the RAT. We evaluated the clinical performance of Standard Q COVID-19 RAT (SQ-RAT; SD Biosensor, Suwon, Korea), the first RAT approved by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. In total, 680 nasopharyngeal swabs previously tested using real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) were retested using SQ-RAT. The clinical sensitivity of SQ-RAT relative to that of rRT-PCR was 28.7% for all specimens and was 81.4% for specimens with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp) threshold cycle (Ct) values â‰¤23.37, which is the limit of detection of SQ-RAT. The specificity was 100%. The clinical sensitivity of SQ-RAT for COVID-19 diagnosis was assessed based on the Ct distribution at diagnosis of 33,294 COVID-19 cases in Korea extracted from the laboratory surveillance system of Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine. The clinical sensitivity of SQ-RAT for COVID-19 diagnosis in the Korean population was 41.8%. Considering the molecular testing capacity in Korea, use of the RAT for COVID-19 diagnosis appears to be limited."
3819,Diagnostic performance of COVID-19 serological assays during early infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 516 samples.,"Objective: The use of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serological testing to diagnose acute infection or determine population seroprevalence relies on understanding assay accuracy during early infection. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of serological testing in COVID-19 by providing summary sensitivity and specificity estimates with time from symptom onset. Methods: A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and PubMed was performed up to May 13, 2020. All English language, original peer-reviewed publications reporting the diagnostic performance of serological testing vis-Ã -vis virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Results: Our search yielded 599 unique publications. A total of 39 publications reporting 11 516 samples from 8872 human participants met eligibility criteria for inclusion in our study. Pooled percentages of IgM and IgG seroconversion by Day 7, 14, 21, 28 and after Day 28 were 37.5%, 73.3%, 81.3%, 72.3% and 73.3%, and 35.4%, 80.6%, 93.3%, 84.4% and 98.9%, respectively. By Day 21, summary estimate of IgM sensitivity was 0.872 (95% CI: 0.784-0.928) and specificity 0.973 (95% CI: 0.938-0.988), while IgG sensitivity was 0.913 (95% CI: 0.823-0.959) and specificity 0.960 (95% CI: 0.919-0.980). On meta-regression, IgM and IgG test accuracy was significantly higher at Day 14 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) compared to other methods. Conclusions: Serological assays offer imperfect sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estimates of population seroprevalence during or shortly after an outbreak will need to adjust for the delay between infection, symptom onset and seroconversion."
