980,"Use of the informational spectrum methodology for rapid biological analysis of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: prediction of potential receptor, natural reservoir, tropism and therapeutic/vaccine target.","A novel coronavirus recently identified in Wuhan, China (SARS-CoV-2) has expanded the number of highly pathogenic coronaviruses affecting humans. The SARS-CoV-2 represents a potential epidemic or pandemic threat, which requires a quick response for preparedness against this infection. The present report uses the informational spectrum methodology to identify the possible origin and natural host of the new virus, as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targets. The performed in silico analysis indicates that the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and, to a lesser degree, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Moreover, the well-known SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well. Actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection. Additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV-2, and that domain 288-330 of S1 protein from the SARS-CoV-2 represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target."
981,Evaluation of seven commercial RT-PCR kits for COVID-19 testing in pooled clinical specimens.,"There are more than 350 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) testing kits commercially available but these kits have not been evaluated for pooled sample testing. Thus, this study was planned to compare and evaluate seven commercially available kits for pooled samples testing. Diagnostic accuracy of (1) TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit (Black Bio), (2) TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), (3) Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay (Seegene), (4) Patho detect COVID-19 PCR kit (My Lab), (5) LabGun COVID-19 RT-PCR Kit (Lab Genomics, Korea), (6) Fosun COVID-19 RT-PCR detection kit (Fosun Ltd.), (7) Real-time Fluorescent RT-PCR kit for SARS CoV-2 (BGI) was evaluated on precharacterised 40 positive and 10 negative COVID-19 sample pools. All seven kits detected all sample pools with low Ct values (<30); while testing weak positive pooled samples with high Ct value (>30); the TRUPCR Kit, TaqPath Kit, Allplex Assay, and BGI RT-PCR kit showed 100% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. However, the Fosun kit, LabGun Kit, and Patho detect kit could detect only 90%, 85%, and 75% of weakly positive samples, respectively. We conclude that all seven commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this study can be used for routine molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. However, regarding performing pooled sample testing, it might be advisable to use those kits that performed best regarding positive identification in samples' pool, that is TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit, TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit, Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay, and BGI Real-time RT-PCR kit for detecting SARS CoV-2."

984,Point-of-care testing for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization (FDA-EUA) authorized point-of-care tests (POCTs) for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for articles published till August 10, 2020. We included studies providing information regarding diagnostic test accuracy of FDA-EUA POCTs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. The review protocol is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (protocol number CRD42020202248). Results: We included 26 studies describing a total of 3242 samples. The summary sensitivity and specificity were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-0.97] and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99-1.00), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99-1.00). A pooled analysis based on the index test revealed a summary sensitivity and specificity of Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 [0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00, respectively)] and ID NOW COVID-19 [0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.82) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00), respectively]. Conclusions: FDA-EUA POCTs, especially molecular assays, have high sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic accuracy for detecting SARS-CoV-2. If approved, FDA-EUA POCTs can provide a rapid and practical way to identify infected individuals early on and help to limit the strain on the healthcare system. However, more high-quality clinical data are required to support our results."
985,Case of erythema multiforme/Stevens-Johnson syndrome: an unusual presentation of COVID-19.,"Dermatological manifestations of COVID-19 are rare, with fever ,dry cough, breathlessness, loss of taste and myalgia constituting most of the symptoms spectrum. However, these rare skin manifestations may be the only presentation of COVID-19 as in our presented patient. It is therefore prudent to be aware of such presentation in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, as this is important for early diagnosis and hence taking appropriate preventive measures."
986,Lessons learned from COVID-19 pandemic in Italy - A commentary.,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Italy has been one of the most affected countries in Europe and the second for number of deaths. In this commentary, we discuss some lessons that we learned as health-care providers working in a large public hospital during the pandemic, with a special focus on the importance of infection containment and early diagnosis, the role of swab, serological tests, home isolation and individual protection devices, and the available therapies and management indications to better face a possible new outbreak in the near future. These comments should stimulate a more diffused, efficient, and efficacious management of COVID-19 patients, also reducing the number of admissions to hospital emergency departments and the related spread of the infection."
987,SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing in Greek hospital paediatric departments: a nationwide study.,"As most children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) present with mild symptoms or they are asymptomatic, the optimal strategy for molecular testing it is not well defined. The aim of the study was to determine the extent and aetiology of molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Greek paediatric departments during the first phase of the pandemic and identify possible differences in incidence, depending on the age group and geographical area. We conducted a nationwide study of molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 of children in paediatric departments between March and June 2020. A total of 65 paediatric departments participated in the study, representing 4901 children who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 90 (1.8%) were positive. Most paediatric cases were associated with topical outbreaks. Adolescents 11-16 years had the highest positivity rate (3.6%) followed by children 6-10 years (1.9%). However, since the testing rate significantly differed between age groups, the modified incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection per age group was highest in infants <1 year (19.25/105 population). Most children tested presented with fever (70.9%), respiratory (50.1%) or gastrointestinal symptoms (28.1%). Significant differences were detected between public and private hospitals regarding the positivity rate (2.34% vs. 0.39%, P-value <0.001). Significant variation in SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing positivity rate and incidence between age groups indicate discrepancies in risk factors among different age groups that shall be considered when ordering molecular testing."

989,Lung Ultrasonography for the Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia in the Emergency Department.,"Study objective: Accurate diagnostic testing to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is critical. Although highly specific, SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been shown in clinical practice to be affected by a noninsignificant proportion of false-negative results. This study seeks to explore whether the integration of lung ultrasonography with clinical evaluation is associated with increased sensitivity for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, and therefore may facilitate the identification of false-negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results. Methods: This prospective cohort study enrolled consecutive adult patients with symptoms potentially related to SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian academic hospital. Immediately after the initial assessment, a lung ultrasonographic evaluation was performed and the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on both clinical and lung ultrasonographic findings (""integrated"" assessment), was recorded. RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection was subsequently performed. Results: We enrolled 228 patients; 107 (46.9%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sensitivity and negative predictive value of the clinical-lung ultrasonographic integrated assessment were higher than first RT-PCR result (94.4% [95% confidence interval {CI} 88.2% to 97.9%] versus 80.4% [95% CI 71.6% to 87.4%] and 95% [95% CI 89.5% to 98.2%] versus 85.2% [95% CI 78.3% to 90.6%], respectively). Among the 142 patients who initially had negative RT-PCR results, 21 tested positive at a subsequent molecular test performed within 72 hours. All these false-negative cases were correctly identified by the integrated assessment. Conclusion: This study suggests that, in patients presenting to the ED with symptoms commonly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the integration of lung ultrasonography with clinical evaluation has high sensitivity and specificity for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and it may help to identify false-negative results occurring with RT-PCR."
