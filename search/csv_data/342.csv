3410,SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Response to the BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine in Persons with Past Natural Infection.,"There are still no agreed guidelines on the vaccination of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for previously infected patients. Here, we present two seropositive healthcare workers (HCWs) working in an isolation ward who recovered from COVID-19 in April 2020 and got vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine in March 2021. We have assessed the clinical course, vaccine-related adverse events, and antibody response after natural infection and after first and second dose vaccination. One of the two HCWs was asymptomatic during quarantine, but the other had mild upper respiratory infection symptoms 1 day before admission, and the symptoms continued for 9 days. There was no pneumonic infiltration in chest X-ray in both patients, and no COVID-19 specific treatment was administered. Total immunoglobulin antibody and neutralizing antibody to anti-spike protein receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were confirmed to be present in both HCWs in blood tests performed at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after discharge. Antibody response to mRNA vaccination showed marked elevation after the first vaccination, which was 30-40 times higher than that of antibody titer after natural infection in each patient (83.2 U/mL vs. > 2,500 U/mL in patient 1; 61.6 U/mL vs. > 2,500 U/mL in patient 2). Signal inhibition rate of neutralizing antibodies was also increased to over 97%. Due to this increased effect, there was little difference in antibody levels after the first and second dose. Both patients 1 and 2 suffered more from adverse vaccine reactions after the second vaccination than from COVID-19 symptoms."
3411,Regional and socioeconomic predictors of perceived ability to access coronavirus testing in the United States: results from a nationwide online COVID-19 survey.,"Purpose: Access to COVID-19 testing remained a salient issue during the early months of the pandemic, therefore this study aimed to identify 1) regional and 2) socioeconomic predictors of perceived ability to access Coronavirus testing. Methods: An online survey using social media-based advertising was conducted among U.S. adults in April 2020. Participants were asked whether they thought they could acquire a COVID-19 test, along with basic demographic, socioeconomic and geographic information. Results: A total of 6,378 participants provided data on perceived access to COVID-19 testing. In adjusted analyses, we found higher income and possession of health insurance to be associated with perceived ability to access Coronavirus testing. Geographically, perceived access was highest (68%) in East South Central division and lowest (39%) in West North Central. Disparities in health insurance coverage did not directly correspond to disparities in perceived access to COVID-19 testing. Conclusions: Sex, geographic location, income, and insurance status were associated with perceived access to COVID-19 testing; interventions aimed at improving either access or awareness of measures taken to improve access are warranted. These findings from the pandemic's early months shed light on the importance of disaggregating perceived and true access to screening during such crises."
3412,COVID-19 vaccination and antirheumatic therapy.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination will be the largest vaccination programme in the history of the NHS. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy will be among the earliest to be vaccinated. Some evidence indicates immunosuppressive therapy inhibits humoral response to the influenza, pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines. The degree to which this will translate to impaired COVID-19 vaccine responses is unclear. Other evidence suggests withholding MTX for 2 weeks post-vaccination may improve responses. Rituximab has been shown to impair humoral responses for 6 months or longer post-administration. Decisions on withholding or interrupting immunosuppressive therapy around COVID-19 vaccination will need to be made prior to the availability of data on specific COVID-19 vaccine response in these patients. With this in mind, this article outlines the existing data on the effect of antirheumatic therapy on vaccine responses in patients with inflammatory arthritis and formulates a possible pragmatic management strategy for COVID-19 vaccination."
3413,[Temporary suspension of AstraZeneca's vaccine; a reconstruction].,"In the middle of the worldwide COVID-19 crisis, the whole of Europe was alarmed about a possible side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine against COVID-19. Consequently, the use of this AstraZeneca vaccine was temporarily suspended in many European nations including the Netherlands. In this article, we chronologically describe the decisions that were made about the use of this vaccine in the Netherlands and we discuss the risk-benefit ratios of these actions as well as possible non-medical reasons that may explain why these actions were taken."
3414,Role of Novel Drug Delivery Systems in Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19): Time to Act Now.,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has found its roots from Wuhan (China). COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, previously named as 2019-nCoV. It has spread across the globe and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March, 2020. Currently, there is no standard drug or vaccine available for the treatment, therefore, repurposing of existing drugs is the only solution. Novel Drug Delivery Systems (NDDS) will be boon for the repurposing of drugs. The role of various NDDS in repurposing of existing drugs for the treatment of various viral diseases and their relevance in COVID-19 has been discussed in this paper. It focuses on the currently ongoing research in the implementation of NDDS in COVID-19. Moreover, it describes the role of NDDS in vaccine development for COVID-19. This paper also emphasizes how NDDS will help to develop the improved delivery systems (dosage forms) of existing therapeutic agents and also explore the new insights to find out the void spaces for potential targeted delivery. Therefore, in these tough times, NDDS and nanotechnology can be a safeguard to humanity."
3415,Tissue-Specific Immunopathology in Fatal COVID-19.,"Rationale: In life-threatening coronavirus disease (COVID-19), corticosteroids reduce mortality, suggesting that immune responses have a causal role in death. Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct reaction to the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or an independent immunopathologic process is unknown.Objectives: To determine SARS-CoV-2 organotropism and organ-specific inflammatory responses and the relationships among viral presence, inflammation, and organ injury.Methods: Tissue was acquired from 11 detailed postmortem examinations. SARS-CoV-2 organotropism was mapped by using multiplex PCR and sequencing, with cellular resolution achieved by in situ viral S (spike) protein detection. Histologic evidence of inflammation was quantified from 37 anatomic sites, and the pulmonary immune response was characterized by using multiplex immunofluorescence.Measurements and Main Results: Multiple aberrant immune responses in fatal COVID-19 were found, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, and these were not clearly topologically associated with the virus. Inflammation and organ dysfunction did not map to the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein between or within tissues. An arteritis was identified in the lung, which was further characterized as a monocyte/myeloid-rich vasculitis, and occurred together with an influx of macrophage/monocyte-lineage cells into the pulmonary parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticuloendothelial responses, including excessive reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages, were present and dissociated from viral presence in lymphoid tissues.Conclusions: Tissue-specific immunopathology occurs in COVID-19, implicating a significant component of the immune-mediated, virus-independent immunopathologic process as a primary mechanism in severe disease. Our data highlight novel immunopathologic mechanisms and validate ongoing and future efforts to therapeutically target aberrant macrophage and plasma-cell responses as well as promote pathogen tolerance in COVID-19."
3416,COVID-19 vaccination in the Indian blood donors: Adjudging the impact on the deferral period.,"The only efficacious way to provide people with herd immunity against the novel corona virus [nCoV] is to administer an appropriate vaccine and help check the current pandemic. With the genetic sequence data of the nCoV already available since January 10, 2020, leading pharmaceutical companies, world over, in turn, have started working on the clinical trials to produce vaccines against this nCoV. In fact, many vaccines under the Phase III trial have claimed to demonstrate their efficacy to be as high as 95% against the nCoV. In January, the central drugs standard control organization, India had granted the emergency-use authorization [EUA] to two vaccines namely, Covishield (live vaccine, Oxford-AstraZeneca, United Kingdom being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, Pune) and Covaxin (inactivated vaccine, Bharat Biotech, India). Although, most of the countries offer no deferral period for the donors who have been administered an inactivated vaccine against this nCoV. However, the national blood transfusion council of India has recently recommended a donor deferral period of 28 days from the last dose of vaccination. This could essentially lead to a massive loss of eligible blood donors and jeopardize the already disrupted blood supply management due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors, herein, propose a thorough redefining of this deferral period post-vaccination amongst the Indian blood donors."

3418,Attenuation of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with multiple sclerosis on ocrelizumab: A case-control study.,"Objective: Ocrelizumab (OCR) is a monoclonal antibody directed at B-cells that is FDA approved for treatment of RRMS and PPMS. Prior studies have raised concerns about patients' ability to form antibodies in response to various antigens, especially SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to determine whether OCR attenuates the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with MS as compared with other disease modifying therapies. Methods: This is a case-control study looking at the odds of developing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patients treated with OCR versus other disease modifying therapies. From May 13, 2020 through March 1, 2021, patients with a RT-PCR-confirmed infection to SARS-CoV-2 were tested for presence of antibodies and the data was recorded. Outpatients with MS at the Methodist Hospitals Comprehensive MS Center were selected who had a prior infection with COVID-19 as demonstrated by RT-PCR in the electronic health records. Odds ratios were calculated to compare rates of antibody formation with OCR exposure vs other DMT. Results: 24 patients had evidence of COVID-19 and had antibody testing available at the time of analysis. Patients who received OCR had decreased odds of forming antibodies (OR 0.045, p = 0.011, 95% CI (0.004,0.488)). Conclusions: Patients who received OCR within the prior 6 months of COVID-19 infection had decreased odds of developing antibodies as compared with other DMTs. This suggests that OCR may attenuate the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Additional studies should analyze the odds of spike protein antibody formation in response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for patients on OCR."
3419,Predicting COVID-19 vaccination intention using protection motivation theory and conspiracy beliefs.,"Background: While COVID-19 vaccine uptake has been encouraging overall, some individuals are either hesitant towards, or refuse, the vaccine. Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) has been applied to influenza vaccine acceptance, but there is a lack of research applying PMT to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Additionally, prior research has suggested that coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and demographic factors may play a role in attitudes towards the vaccine. This study aimed to predict COVID-19 vaccination intention using PMT, coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, and demographic factors. Furthermore, vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were compared in relation to their coronavirus conspiracy beliefs. Methods: An online survey was administered to 382 (278 vaccinated, and 104 unvaccinated) individuals in the United Kingdom (77 males, 301 females, one non-binary/third gender, and three unstated). Respondents' mean age was 43.78 (SD = 12.58). Results: A hierarchical multiple linear regression was performed in three stages. Initially, four PMT constructs - severity, susceptibility, maladaptive response costs, and self-efficacy - emerged as significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intention. The final model accounted for 75% of the variance and retained two significant predictors from PMT - maladaptive response rewards and self-efficacy - alongside coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and age. An independent t-test established that unvaccinated individuals held greater coronavirus conspiracy beliefs than vaccinated ones. Conclusions: Interventions and campaigns addressing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance should employ strategies increasing individuals' perceived severity of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility, and perceived ability to get vaccinated, while decreasing perceived rewards of not getting vaccinated. Additionally, coronavirus conspiracy beliefs should be addressed, as these appear to play a role for some vaccine-hesitant individuals."
