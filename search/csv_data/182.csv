1810,Clinical Course and Molecular Viral Shedding Among Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a Community Treatment Center in the Republic of Korea.,"Importance: There is limited information about the clinical course and viral load in asymptomatic patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objective: To quantitatively describe SARS-CoV-2 molecular viral shedding in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Design, setting, and participants: A retrospective evaluation was conducted for a cohort of 303 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 6 and March 26, 2020. Participants were isolated in a community treatment center in Cheonan, Republic of Korea. Main outcomes and measures: Epidemiologic, demographic, and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Attending health care personnel carefully identified patients' symptoms during isolation. The decision to release an individual from isolation was based on the results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharynx and oropharynx swab) and lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum) for SARS-CoV-2. This testing was performed on days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of isolation. On days 10, 17, 18, and 19, RT-PCR assays from the upper or lower respiratory tract were performed at physician discretion. Cycle threshold (Ct) values in RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection were determined in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Results: Of the 303 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the median (interquartile range) age was 25 (22-36) years, and 201 (66.3%) were women. Only 12 (3.9%) patients had comorbidities (10 had hypertension, 1 had cancer, and 1 had asthma). Among the 303 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 193 (63.7%) were symptomatic at the time of isolation. Of the 110 (36.3%) asymptomatic patients, 21 (19.1%) developed symptoms during isolation. The median (interquartile range) interval of time from detection of SARS-CoV-2 to symptom onset in presymptomatic patients was 15 (13-20) days. The proportions of participants with a negative conversion at day 14 and day 21 from diagnosis were 33.7% and 75.2%, respectively, in asymptomatic patients and 29.6% and 69.9%, respectively, in symptomatic patients (including presymptomatic patients). The median (SE) time from diagnosis to the first negative conversion was 17 (1.07) days for asymptomatic patients and 19.5 (0.63) days for symptomatic (including presymptomatic) patients (P = .07). The Ct values for the envelope (env) gene from lower respiratory tract specimens showed that viral loads in asymptomatic patients from diagnosis to discharge tended to decrease more slowly in the time interaction trend than those in symptomatic (including presymptomatic) patients (β = -0.065 [SE, 0.023]; P = .005). Conclusions and relevance: In this cohort study of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were isolated in a community treatment center in Cheonan, Republic of Korea, the Ct values in asymptomatic patients were similar to those in symptomatic patients. Isolation of asymptomatic patients may be necessary to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2."

1814,ECMO support in SARS-CoV2 multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in a child.,"In this report, we describe the case of a 5-year-old male with SARS-CoV-2 associated MIS-C with progressive respiratory failure and vasoplegic shock requiring extracorporeal support. At presentation, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, however, SARS-CoV2 antibody testing was positive. Multiple inflammatory markers and cardiac biomarkers were elevated. Echocardiogram demonstrated mildly depressed left ventricular function and no coronary anomalies noted. The patient required mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and eventually extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for profound circulatory shock and progressive respiratory failure. During his clinical course, recovery of cardiac function was demonstrated however, a middle cerebral artery infarct and left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage was suffered which ultimately the patient succumbed to. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest previously healthy child who had multi-system hyperinflammatory syndrome requiring ECMO support and the first case of SARS-CoV-2 related pediatric stroke.Clinical Trial Registration: None."
1815,Vaxign2: the second generation of the first Web-based vaccine design program using reverse vaccinology and machine learning.,"Vaccination is one of the most significant inventions in medicine. Reverse vaccinology (RV) is a state-of-the-art technique to predict vaccine candidates from pathogen's genome(s). To promote vaccine development, we updated Vaxign2, the first web-based vaccine design program using reverse vaccinology with machine learning. Vaxign2 is a comprehensive web server for rational vaccine design, consisting of predictive and computational workflow components. The predictive part includes the original Vaxign filtering-based method and a new machine learning-based method, Vaxign-ML. The benchmarking results using a validation dataset showed that Vaxign-ML had superior prediction performance compared to other RV tools. Besides the prediction component, Vaxign2 implemented various post-prediction analyses to significantly enhance users' capability to refine the prediction results based on different vaccine design rationales and considerably reduce user time to analyze the Vaxign/Vaxign-ML prediction results. Users provide proteome sequences as input data, select candidates based on Vaxign outputs and Vaxign-ML scores, and perform post-prediction analysis. Vaxign2 also includes precomputed results from approximately 1 million proteins in 398 proteomes of 36 pathogens. As a demonstration, Vaxign2 was used to effectively analyse SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19. The comprehensive framework of Vaxign2 can support better and more rational vaccine design. Vaxign2 is publicly accessible at http://www.violinet.org/vaxign2."
1816,Nanomedicinal delivery of stimulator of interferon genes agonists: recent advances in virus vaccination.,"The discovery of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and their agonists as primary components that link antiviral innate and adaptive immunity has motivated growing research on STING agonist-mediated immunotherapy and vaccine development. To overcome the delivery challenge in shuttling highly polar STING agonists, typically in the form of cyclic dinucleotides, to target cells and to STING proteins in cellular cytosol, numerous nanoformulation strategies have been implemented for effective STING activation. While many STING-activating nanoparticles are developed to enhance anticancer immunotherapy, their adoption as vaccine adjuvant has vastly propelled antiviral vaccination efforts against challenging public health threats, including HIV, influenza and coronaviruses. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic that has thrusted vaccine development into the public spotlight, this review highlights advances in nanomedicinal STING agonist delivery with an emphasis on their applications in antiviral vaccination."

1818,2020 in 20/20 hindsight.,"For biologic scientists, as for the society in general, the year 2020 was one that few will soon forget. However, in the realm of science, it is possible that it won't be remembered purely, or even mainly, for the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the many discoveries related to its causative agent. Even as non-SARS-related research was brought to a near standstill for much of the year, we may in time come to recognize that revolutionary work in other areas of biology was emerging unnoticed under the shadow of the virus."
1819,Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 by vaccine and convalescent serum.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has undergone progressive change, with variants conferring advantage rapidly becoming dominant lineages, e.g., B.1.617. With apparent increased transmissibility, variant B.1.617.2 has contributed to the current wave of infection ravaging the Indian subcontinent and has been designated a variant of concern in the United Kingdom. Here we study the ability of monoclonal antibodies and convalescent and vaccine sera to neutralize B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2, complement this with structural analyses of Fab/receptor binding domain (RBD) complexes, and map the antigenic space of current variants. Neutralization of both viruses is reduced compared with ancestral Wuhan-related strains, but there is no evidence of widespread antibody escape as seen with B.1.351. However, B.1.351 and P.1 sera showed markedly more reduction in neutralization of B.1.617.2, suggesting that individuals infected previously by these variants may be more susceptible to reinfection by B.1.617.2. This observation provides important new insights for immunization policy with future variant vaccines in non-immune populations."
