4051,Rebuilding public trust: a clarified response to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy predicament.,"As the world welcomes the availability and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, coupled with it is the 'hesitant' predicament of some Filipinos to get vaccinated because of the confusing information regarding its efficacy. With this, the government needs to build up public trust to assure a successful vaccination program. A recent study suggested that a more 'localized' public education and role-modeling from public officials and health authorities can help in building public trust. However, this needs a lot of clarification if applied in the current situation where education is fully executed online. The problem now lies in the country's poor internet connectivity which greatly affects the online setup. This study then proposes that a house-to-house massive information campaign by local health care personnel which is led by a medical doctor to ensure a credible explanation of the entire procedure. In the same way, the idea of public officials as role-models seemed to be ineffective since there were already casualties linked to the vaccine. A consistent transparent approach is suggested in lieu of this which can prepare the country for a more defensive strategy to fight the pandemic."

4053,Implementation of a COVID-19 surveillance programme for healthcare workers in a teaching hospital in an upper-middle-income country.,"Introduction: The reporting of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) mortality among healthcare workers highlights their vulnerability in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Some low- and middle-income countries have highlighted the challenges with COVID-19 testing, such as inadequate capacity, untrained laboratory personnel, and inadequate funding. This article describes the components and implementation of a healthcare worker surveillance programme in a designated COVID-19 teaching hospital in Malaysia. In addition, the distribution and characteristics of healthcare workers placed under surveillance are described. Material and methods: A COVID-19 healthcare worker surveillance programme was implemented in University Malaya Medical Centre. The programme involved four teams: contact tracing, risk assessment, surveillance and outbreak investigation. Daily symptom surveillance was conducted over fourteen days for healthcare workers who were assessed to have low-, moderate- and high-risk of contracting COVID-19. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted for data collected over 24 weeks, from the 6th of March 2020 to the 20th of August 2020. Results: A total of 1,174 healthcare workers were placed under surveillance. The majority were females (71.6%), aged between 25 and 34 years old (64.7%), were nursing staff (46.9%) and had no comorbidities (88.8%). A total of 70.9% were categorised as low-risk, 25.7% were moderate-risk, and 3.4% were at high risk of contracting COVID-19. One-third (35.2%) were symptomatic, with the sore throat (23.6%), cough (19.8%) and fever (5.0%) being the most commonly reported symptoms. A total of 17 healthcare workers tested positive for COVID-19, with a prevalence of 0.3% among all the healthcare workers. Risk category and presence of symptoms were associated with a positive COVID-19 test (p<0.001). Fever (p<0.001), cough (p = 0.003), shortness of breath (p = 0.015) and sore throat (p = 0.002) were associated with case positivity. Conclusion: COVID-19 symptom surveillance and risk-based assessment have merits to be included in a healthcare worker surveillance programme to safeguard the health of the workforce."
4054,Prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2-specific Antibodies in German Blood Donors during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While RT-PCR assays are used routinely to diagnose active COVID-19, serological testing offers a means of identifying individuals who previously experienced asymptomatic infections, as well as those who experienced symptomatic infections but no longer carry the virus. Methods: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies in the sera of 673 blood donors residing in south-western Germany before and 3,880 donors after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was determined and confirmed using two highly sensitive serological tests. Results: Approximately 0.40% of the donors assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic possessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies, decidedly fewer than the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals determined by real-time RT-PCR nationwide. Conclusions: These findings confirm the efficacy serological testing in identifying asymptomatic COVID-19 patients."
4055,Performance Evaluation of the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 Test for Point-of-Care Detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"Nucleic acid amplification for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in respiratory samples is the standard method for diagnosis. The majority of this testing is centralized and therefore has turnaround times of several days. Point-of-care (POC) testing with rapid turnaround times would allow more effective triage in settings where patient management and infection control decisions need to be made rapidly. The inclusivity and specificity of the Simple AMplification-Based Assay (SAMBA) II SARS-CoV-2 test were determined by both in silico analyses of the primers and probes and wet testing. The SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test was evaluated for performance characteristics. Clinical performance was evaluated in residual combined throat/nose swabs and compared to that of the Public Health England real-time PCR assay targeting the RdRp gene. The SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test has an analytical sensitivity of 250 copies/ml for detecting two regions of the genome (open reading frame 1ab [ORF1ab] and nucleocapsid protein [N]). The clinical performance was evaluated in 172 residual combined nose/throat swabs provided by the Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge (CMPHL), which showed an estimated positive percent agreement of 98.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.83 to 99.97) and negative percent agreement of 96.4% (95% CI, 89.92 to 99.26) compared to testing by the CMPHL. The data show that the SAMBA II SARS-CoV-2 test performs equivalently to the centralized testing methods, but with a shorter turnaround time of 86 to 101 min. Point-of-care tests such as SAMBA should enable rapid patient management and effective implementation of infection control measures."

4057,The impact of COVID-19 on ischemic stroke.,"Background: The outbreak of a novel coronavirus since December 2019, became an emergency of major international concern. As of June 21, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused 8,769,844 confirmed infections with 463,745 fatal cases worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is a major challenge for clinicians. In our clinic, we found a rare case that a COVID-19 patient combined with ischemic stroke. Case presentation: A 79-year-old man was admitted to the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine due to right limb weakness for 1 day and slight cough for 1 week. At presentation, his oxygen saturation was 94.2% on room air and body temperature was 37.3 °C (99.0 °F) with some moist rales. Neurological examination showed right limb weakness, and the limb muscle strength was grade 4. The left leg and arms were unaffected. In addition, runs of speech were not fluent enough with tongue deviation. Laboratory studies showed lymphopenia and eosinophilic granulocytopenia. Chest CT revealed bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, with a peripheral lung distribution. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from throat swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. This patient was treated with antiviral drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs with supportive care until his discharge. Clopidogrel (75 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) were administered orally to treat acute ischemic stroke. After 12 days of treatment, he can walk normally and communicate with near fluent language. Conclusion: We report an even more unusual case, a patient who was hospitalized for right limb weakness and was later diagnosed with COVID-19. Here, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused hypoxemia and excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the occurrence and development of ischemic stroke. Once COVID-19 patients show acute ischemic stroke, neurologists should cooperate with infectious disease doctors to help patients."
4058,COVID-19 Management in Clinical Dental Care Part II: Personal Protective Equipment for the Dental Care Professional.,"Background: Facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) challenge on a global level, dental care professionals are encouraged to optimize universal precautions and adopt measures that ensure protection against infection by contaminated aerosols and droplets. Although aerosol transmission is possible, direct contact through large droplets is probably responsible for the vast majority of transmissions. Methods: This paper is the second of a series of 3 on the management of COVID-19 in clinical dental care settings and aims to describe the selection and use of personal protection equipment (PPE) by dental care professionals (DCP), with consideration of the level of risk associated with the planned procedures. PPE selection depends directly on the local epidemiological setting, the patient's characteristics, and the level of risk of the planned procedures. The procedures performed in the office environment are classified as low-, moderate-, or high-risk. Moderate risk includes 2 further sublevels associated with the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of materials for clinical procedures that do not generate aerosols. The training of DCP on how to properly don (put on) and doff (remove) PPE is as important as choosing the appropriate PPE because it can be associated with a risk of infection. Discussion: When there is limited availability of PPE, measures should be adjusted to the risk associated with the intervention. Assuming that an effective COVID-19 vaccine will be developed, once it becomes widely available for DCP, PPE requirements will likely be different. Conclusion: The proper use of PPE, together with the adoption of other operational procedures, can provide effective protection against microorganisms being transmitted via body fluids or in the air."
