8811,Therapy with RAS inhibitors during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The global number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has surpassed 28,285,700 with mortality that appears higher than for seasonal influenza. About 20% of COVID-19 patients have experienced cardiac involvement and myocardial infarction in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a worse prognosis. Furthermore, the widespread use of antiviral drugs can be linked to a worsening of heart function. Arrhythmias and hypertension have also been reported in patients with Covid-19. On the other hand, previous cardiac diseases are present in 30% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There is uncertainty in the use of ace inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonists in the COVID-19 era. The mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 has been elucidated. It has been demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and it is required for host cell entry and subsequent viral replication. The effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the downregulation of ACE2 that may contribute to the severity of lung pathologies as well as the cardiac function. ACE2, a homolog of ACE, is a monocarboxypeptidase that converts Ang II into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) that with its vasodilatory, antifibrotic, antihypertrophic effects counterbalances the negative effects of Ang II. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and AT1R blockers have been shown to upregulate the expression of ACE2. Based on the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, the use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors was questioned although all scientific societies did not recommend discontinuation when clinically recommended. The BRACE CORONA, a phase 4, randomized study tested two strategies: temporarily stopping the ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) for 30 days versus continuing ACE inhibitors/ARBs in patients who were taking these medications chronically and were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was also discussed. Therefore, the goal of this review is to summarize recent laboratory and clinical investigations concerning the use of ACEi and ARBs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The available data, based also on a randomized trial, suggest that ACEIs or ARBs, when clinically indicated, should be regularly used in the COVID-19 era."
8812,A Recent Achievement in the Discovery and Development of Vaccines and Therapeutic Agents in the Race for COVID-19 Protection and Treatment.,"Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a big challenge to the healthcare systems in the world. Several researchers in the world have immediately carried out clinical investigations for the discovery of vaccines and drugs. Different studies have shown that antiviral measures including small bioactive compounds targeting multifaceted molecular communications take in COVID-19 infection. The drug development archived in this review emphasizes mainly on drugs that are effective for the Management of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and other RNA viruses. The investigation of therapeutic agents for COVID-19 includes anti-inflammatory agents, antibodies, and nucleic acid-based treatments targeting virus gene expression as well as different sorts of vaccines. Numerous patents revealed techniques of these biologics with the potential for treating and preventing coronavirus infections, which may apply to COVID-19. Phase 3 clinical trials such as Sputnik V, AZD1222, mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad5-nCoV, Anti-COVID antibodies, Kevzara; Actemra, Jakafi; Baricitinib, and some others were undergoing in the race for Covid-19 treatment. However, there's still a lack of a review on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 management. Therefore, this review summarizes different studies that are ongoing in the race for Covid-19 protection and treatment."
8813,Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulation Therapy in the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) decoction with different intervention timepoints in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We retrospectively collected the medical records and evaluated the outcomes of COVID-19 patients that received TCM decoction treatment at different timepoints. A total of 234 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Patients who received TCM decoction therapy within 3 days or 7 days after admission could achieve shorter hospitalization days and disease periods compared to those who received TCM decoction [Formula: see text] 7 days after admission (all [Formula: see text]). Patients who received TCM decoction therapy within 3 days had significantly fewer days to negative SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal/oral swab and days to negative SARS-CoV-2 from urine/stool/blood samples compared to those received TCM decoction [Formula: see text] days after admission (all [Formula: see text]). Patients who received TCM decoction therapy on the 3rd to 7th day after admission had a faster achievement of negative SARS-CoV-2 from urine/stool/blood samples compared to those who received TCM decoction [Formula: see text] days after admission ([Formula: see text]). Logistic models revealed that more days from TCM decoction to admission [Formula: see text] days might be a risk factor for long hospitalization days, disease period, and slower negative-conversion of SARS-CoV-2 (all [Formula: see text]). Conclusively, our results suggest that TCM decoction therapy should be considered at the early stage of COVID-19 patients."
8814,Genetic Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 among Travelers Arriving in Hong Kong.,"We sequenced 10% of imported severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections detected in travelers to Hong Kong and revealed the genomic diversity of regions of origin, including lineages not previously reported from those countries. Our results suggest that international or regional travel hubs might be useful surveillance sites to monitor sequence diversity."
8815,Rapid Serological Assays and SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2: Comparative Study.,"Background: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for the identification of viral nucleic acid is the current standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but technical issues limit its utilization for large-scale screening. Serological immunoglobulin M (IgM)/IgG testing has been proposed as a useful tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Objective: The objective of our study was to compare the results of the rapid serological VivaDiag test for SARS-CoV-2-related IgM/IgG detection with those of the standard RT-PCR laboratory test for identifying SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Methods: We simultaneously performed both serological and molecular tests with a consecutive series of 191 symptomatic patients. The results provided by a new rapid serological colorimetric test for analyzing IgM/IgG expression were compared with those of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results: Of the 191 subjects, 70 (36.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR results, while 34 (17.3%) tested positive based on serological IgM/IgG expression. Additionally, 13 (6.8%) subjects tested positive based on serological test results, but also tested negative based on RT-PCR results. The rapid serological test had a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 89% compared to the standard RT-PCR assay. Interestingly, the performance of both assays improved 8 days after symptom appearance. After 10 days had passed since symptom appearance, the predictive value of the rapid serological test was higher than that of the standard molecular assay (proportion of positive results: 40% vs 20%). Multivariate analysis showed that age >58 years (P<.01) and period of >15 days after symptom onset (P<.02) were significant and independent factors associated with serological test positivity. Conclusions: The rapid serological test analyzed in this study seems limited in terms of usefulness when diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it may be useful for providing relevant information on people's immunoreaction to COVID-19 exposure."
8816,"SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: Much Accomplished, Much to Learn.","As COVID vaccines roll out, internists and other health care providers are being turned to as trusted sources of information for patients and communities. Here, experts from NIAID outline the current state of knowledge regarding such vaccines. They contrast vaccine platforms, summarize clinical trial data regarding efficacy and safety, and comment on key questions including the ability of current vaccines to protect against infection and to decrease the prevalence of virus in the community."
8817,Clinical Characteristics and Mortality of Health-Care Workers With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in Mexico City.,"Background: We evaluated the risk of death for health-care workers (HCW) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Mexico City during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and describe the associated factors in hospitalized HCW, compared with non-HCW. Methods: We analyzed data from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases registered from 27 February-31 August 2020 in Mexico City's public database. Individuals were classified as non-HCW or HCW (subcategorized as physicians, nurses, and other HCW). In hospitalized individuals, a multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the potential factors associated with death and compare mortality risks among groups. Results: A total of 125 665 patients were included. Of these, 13.1% were HCW (28% physicians, 38% nurses, and 34% other HCW). Compared with non-HCW, HCW were more frequently female, were younger, and had fewer comorbidities. Overall, 25 771 (20.5%) were treated as inpatients and 11 182 (8.9%) deaths were reported. Deaths in the total population (9.9% vs 1.9%, respectively; P < .001) and in hospitalized patients (39.6% vs 19.3%, respectively; P < .001) were significantly higher in non-HCW than in HCW. In hospitalized patients, using a multivariate model, the risk of death was lower in HCW in general (odds ratio [OR], 0.53) than in non-HCW, and the risks were also lower by specific occupation (OR for physicians, 0.60; OR for nurses, 0.29; OR for other HCW 0.61). Conclusions: HCW represent an important proportion of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Mexico City. While the mortality risk is lower in HCW compared to non-HCW, a high mortality rate in hospitalized patients was observed in this study. Among HCW, nurses had a lower risk of death compared to physicians and other HCW."
8818,Antiviral drugs proposed for COVID-19: action mechanism and pharmacological data.,"Objective: As a beta-coronavirus, Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused one of the most significant historical pandemics, as well as various health and medical challenges. Our purpose in this report is to collect, summarize, and articulate all essential information about antiviral drugs that may or may not be efficient for treating COVID-19. Clinical evidence about these drugs and their possible mechanisms of action are also discussed. Materials and methods: To conduct a comprehensive review, different keywords in various databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, were searched relevant articles, especially the most recent ones, were selected and studied. These selected original research articles, review papers, systematic reviews, and even letters to the editors were then carefully reviewed for data collection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of the coronavirus family, and there are still no promising therapies or particular antiviral compounds to fight it. After entering the body, SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the cells by attaching to specific lung cell receptors, called angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Then, by employing cell division machinery, it replicates through a complex mechanism and spreads throughout the patient's body. Various antiviral drugs, including anti-influenza/HIV/HCV drugs, have been applied for treating COVID-19 patients. Due to the similarity of the structure and transcriptional mechanism of COVID-19 to a number of viruses, some of the listed drugs have been beneficial against SARS-CoV-2. However, the effectiveness of others is in an aura of ambiguity and doubt. Conclusions: Some of the antiviral medications listed and discussed in this article have been effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients or preventing the virus from spreading further. However, other drugs have to be investigated to reach a reliable conclusion about their effectiveness or ineffectiveness."
8819,Correlation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater with COVID-19 disease burden in sewersheds.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is shed in feces and the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) is detectable in wastewater. A nine-week wastewater epidemiology study of ten wastewater facilities, serving 39% of the state of Utah or 1.26 M individuals was conducted in April and May of 2020. COVID-19 cases were tabulated from within each sewershed boundary. RNA from SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in 61% of 126 wastewater samples. Urban sewersheds serving >100,000 individuals and tourist communities had higher detection frequencies. An outbreak of COVID-19 across two communities positively correlated with an increase in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA, while a decline in COVID-19 cases preceded a decline in RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA followed a first order decay rate in wastewater, while 90% of the RNA was present in the liquid phase of the influent. Infiltration and inflow, virus decay and sewershed characteristics should be considered during correlation analysis of SAR-CoV-2 with COVID-19 cases. These results provide evidence of the utility of wastewater epidemiology to assist in public health responses to COVID-19."
