3862,Management of COVID-19: current status and future prospects.,"COVID-19, a highly transmissible pandemic disease, is affecting millions of lives around the world. Severely infected patients show acute respiratory distress symptoms. Sustainable management strategies are required to save lives of the infected people and further preventing spread of the virus. Diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination development initiatives are already exhibited from the scientific community to fight against this virus. In this review, we primarily discuss the management strategies including prevention of spread, prophylaxis, vaccinations, and treatment for COVID-19. Further, analysis of vaccine development status and performance are also briefly discussed. Global socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 is also analyzed as part of this review."
3863,Ocular Surface Impairment After Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Cohort Study.,"Purpose: This is a cohort study to evaluate the presence of objective signs and subjective symptoms of dry eye disease in postcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients compared with the control. Methods: Prospective, observational, single-ctenter, cohort study. Sixty-four post-COVID-19 patients and 50 control were recruited. All participants underwent a complete ophthalmological examination including Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire (OSDI), best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, fundus examination, Schirmer test type 1, tear break-up time test (tBUT), evaluation of conjunctival hyperemia, corneal staining, and tear film osmolarity test. Results: The OSDI score was higher in the post-COVID-19 group in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (P < 0.001 and P =0.012, respectively). The mean tBUT in post-COVID-19 patients was 6.95 ± 4.07 seconds compared with a mean tBUT of 10.12 ± 3.90 seconds in the control group. The post-COVID-19 group showed a higher number of patients with a simultaneous impairment of the OSDI score and tBUT (P = 0.019). The Schirmer test results were strikingly significant both in the quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis (P <0.001 and P = 0.0014, respectively). Both quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis revealed a significant difference in tear osmolarity in the 2 groups. Conclusions: Comparing the ocular surface assessment of post-COVID-19 patients with heathy control, a statistically significant increase of dry eye disease has emerged both in subjective and objective evaluations. Our clinical results support the findings that suggested a susceptibility of the ocular surface to the virus, and it underlines the importance of the ocular surface assessment in post-COVID-19 patients for a correct diagnosis and therapy."

We identified themes in the commentary that highlighted the safety, efficacy, ethics, and trustworthiness and transparency regarding the novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. A ""Learning Immunization System"" model is proposed to optimize public, private, and academic partnerships relating to vaccine development and implementation."
3867,Chest CT of COVID-19 in patients with a negative first RT-PCR test: Comparison with patients with a positive first RT-PCR test.,"To compare clinical and imaging features between patients with an initial negative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test and patients with an initial positive RT-PCR test. CT follow-up analysis in the negative RT-PCR group is also described.Thirty-three patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR, with 216 lesions upon CT, were included. Demographic information and chest CT imaging features were collected.The average age in the whole study group was 46.9 ± 11.1 years, with 18 males and 15 females. Patients in the positive RT-PCR test group were more likely to have a fever than patients in the negative RT-PCR test group (85.7% vs 50%, P < .05). Lesions in the positive group were more likely to be located in the peripheral area than lesions in the negative group (83.6% vs 68.2%, P < .05). Regarding the appearance of 216 lesions, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with consolidation (43.2%) was the most common appearance in the negative group, followed by pure GGOs (31.8%), while in the positive group, pure GGOs (32%) and GGOs with interlobular septal thickening (32.8%) were both most frequent, and the difference between them was evident (P < .05). For the follow-up analysis, the largest short-axis of a lesion was smaller upon follow-up (median size 13.6 mm vs 14 mm), albeit by a smaller margin. Pure GGOs decreased in frequency, from 31.3% to 21.3%, while consolidation increased in frequency, from 7.5% to 12.5%.The manifestations of COVID-19 in patients with a first negative RT-PCR test and patients with a positive first RT-PCR test are different to some extent. The consolidation component may increase after follow-up."

3869,Countries with similar COVID-19 vaccination rates yet divergent outcomes: are all vaccines created equal?,"The world is currently engaged in a race of vaccination versus infection in an effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Some countries have already achieved high vaccination rates, offering a glimpse into the so-called ""post-vaccination"" world. We describe here a striking comparison between the similar-sized and neighboring countries of Bahrain and Qatar. While both countries have achieved impressive vaccination rates, cases increased to unprecedented levels in one country while decreasing steadily in the other. Although this could be attributed to a number of factors, we argue here that the heavy reliance on alum-adjuvanted inactivated virus vaccines may have contributed to these discrepant outcomes. We then expand the analysis to compare the outcomes of the top 10 vaccinated countries based on their reliance on inactivated virus vaccines. The results remarkably align with the initial findings seen in Bahrain and Qatar. Countries that did not use inactivated virus vaccines achieved steady declines in daily COVID-19 deaths, while other countries did not. This work highlights the urgent need to further study the effectiveness of alum-adjuvanted inactivated virus vaccines for COVID-19 before expanding their use."
