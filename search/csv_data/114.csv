1130,Performance Characteristics of a Rapid Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antigen Detection Assay at a Public Plaza Testing Site in San Francisco.,"We evaluated the performance of the Abbott BinaxNOW rapid antigen test for coronavirus disease 2019 (Binax-CoV2) to detect virus among persons, regardless of symptoms, at a public plaza site of ongoing community transmission. Titration with cultured severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 yielded a human observable threshold between 1.6 × 104-4.3 × 104 viral RNA copies (cycle threshold [Ct], 30.3-28.8). Among 878 subjects tested, 3% (26 of 878) were positive by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, of whom 15 of 26 had a Ct <30, indicating high viral load; of these, 40% (6 of 15) were asymptomatic. Using this Ct threshold (<30) for Binax-CoV2 evaluation, the sensitivity of Binax-CoV2 was 93.3% (95% confidence interval, 68.1%-99.8%) (14 of 15) and the specificity was 99.9% (99.4%-99.9%) (855 of 856)."

1132,Comparison of the GeneFinder(TM) COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit on the sample-to-result Platform ELITe InGenius to the national reference method: An added value of N gene target detection?,"Background: Due to the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate testing on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of the GeneFinderTMCOVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit on the ELITe InGenius sample-to-result platform, which is a commercial nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) targeting genes of SARS-CoV-2. Study design: Patients were eligible between March 18 and May 27, 2020, when they had respiratory symptoms that were suspected for COVID-19. The InGenius platform was compared to routine in-house NAT that was validated according to the national reference. Results: Of 128 randomly selected patients, 58 (45 %) tested positive and 55 (43 %) tested negative in both platforms. Sensitivity of the InGenius platform was 100 % (95 % confidence interval 94-100). In the remaining 15 (12 %) cases E and RdRp genes were not detected in both platforms but the nucleoprotein (N) gene was tested positive by the InGenius platform. All solitary N gene positive cases were confirmed by a N-gene specific in-house validated NAT, and most of these patients could also be considered positive based on other recently available COVID-19 positive respiratory samples or highly suspected radiological findings. Conclusion: The InGenius platform for SARS-CoV-2 detection has excellent sensitivity, is easy to use and provides fast results. The inclusion of the N gene as a third gene target may further increase sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in comparison to the national reference method."
1133,"Clinically relevant cell culture models and their significance in isolation, pathogenesis, vaccine development, repurposing and screening of new drugs for SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review.","Background: In-Vitro/Cellular evidence is the backbone and vital proof of concept during the development of novel therapeutics as well as drugs repurposing against COVID-19. Choosing an ideal in-vitro model is vital as the virus entry is through ACE2, CD147, and TMPRSS2 dependant and very specific. In this regard, this is the first systematic review addressing the importance of specific cell lines used as potential in-vitro models in the isolation, pathogenesis, and therapeutics for SARS-COV-2. Methods: We searched 17 literature databases with appropriate keywords, and identified 1173 non-duplicate studies. In the present study, 71 articles are included after a careful, thorough screening of the titles and their abstracts for possible inclusion using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria (PRISMA Guidelines). Results: In the current study, we compiled cell culture-based studies for SARS-CoV-2 and found the best compatible In-Vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 (Vero, VeroE6, HEK293 as well as its variants, Huh-7, Calu-3 2B4, and Caco2). Among other essential cell lines used include LLC-MK2, MDCKII, BHK-21, HepG2, A549,T cell leukemia (MT-2), stems cells based cell line DYR0100for differentiation assays, and embryo-specific NIH3T3 cell line for vaccine production. Conclusion: The Present study provides a detailed summary of all the drugs/compounds screened for drug repurposing and discovery purpose using the in-vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 along with isolation, pathogenesis and vaccine production. This study also suggests that after careful evaluation of all the cell line based studies, Kidney cells (VeroE6, HEK293 along with their clones), liver Huh-7cells, respiratory Calu-3 cells, and intestinal Caco-2 are the most widely used in-vitro models for SARS-CoV-2."
1134,Immunobiology and nanotherapeutics of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2): a current update.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) constitutes the most significant global public health challenge in a century. It has reignited research interest in coronavirus. While little information is available, research is currently in progress to comprehensively understand the general biology and immune response mechanism against SARS-CoV-2. The spike proteins (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 perform a crucial function in viral infection establishment. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 play a pivotal role in viral entry. Upon viral entry, the released pro-inflammatory proteins (cytokines and chemokines) cause the migration of the T cells, monocytes, and macrophages to the infection site. IFNϒ released by T cells initiates a loop of pro-inflammatory feedback. The inflammatory state may further enhance with an increase in immune dysfunction responsible for the infection's progression. A treatment approach that prevents ACE2-mediated viral entry and reduces inflammatory response is a crucial therapeutic intervention strategy, and nanomaterials and their conjugates are promising candidates. Nanoparticles can inhibit viral entry and replication. Nanomaterials have also found application in targeted drug delivery and also in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we briefly summarize the origin, transmission, and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2. We then discussed the immune response mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we further discussed nanotechnology's potentials as an intervention strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. All these understandings will be crucial in developing therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2."

1136,Racing to immunity: Journey to a COVID-19 vaccine and lessons for the future.,"SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic. Since its emergence, the global scientific community has mobilized to study this virus, and an overwhelming effort to identify COVID-19 treatments is currently ongoing for a variety of therapeutics and prophylactics. To better understand these efforts, we compiled a list of all COVID-19 vaccines undergoing preclinical and clinical testing using the WHO and ClinicalTrials.gov database, with details surrounding trial design and location. The most advanced vaccines are discussed in more detail, with a focus on their technology, advantages and disadvantages, as well as any available recent clinical findings. We also cover some of the primary challenges, safety concerns and public responses to COVID-19 vaccine trials, and consider what this can mean for the future. By compiling this information, we aim to facilitate a more thorough understanding of the extensive COVID-19 clinical testing vaccine landscape as it unfolds, and better highlight some of the complexities and challenges being faced by the joint effort of the scientific community in finding a prophylactic against COVID-19."
1137,Recomendaciones para procedimientos quirurgicos durante la pandemia de COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Liderazgo hacia el retorno a lo electivo.,"In late December 2019, COVID-19, a new emerging disease, quickly spread in Wuhan, China. The WHO formally declared it a pandemic and a health emergency on March 11th, 2020. The objective of this article is to specify and list key points in relation to the recommendations issued by the different colleges, and global surgical societies, for the benefit of the Mexican medical and surgical community. Based on scientific evidence, we make recommendations for medical consultations, surgical and endoscopic procedures, hospital infrastructure, and surgical services, in addition to a proposal to reopen surgical services and elective procedures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The time to take leadership in healthcare where the national health system together with academic societies, universities and private initiative join forces to combat the pandemic has arrived. It is convenient to form collaboration groups of experts in the different specialties that through innovation in health and education, with evidence-based medicine, efficiency of operational costs and tools such as telemedicine, allow us to return to daily surgical procedures, reestablishing the surgery services as soon as possible."
1138,Histologic and Immunohistochemical Evaluation of 65 Placentas From Women With Polymerase Chain Reaction-Proven Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection.,"Context.—: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been shown to have effects outside of the respiratory system. Placental pathology in the setting of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains a topic of great interest because earlier studies have shown mixed results. Objective.—: To ascertain whether maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with any specific placental histopathology, and to evaluate the virus's propensity for direct placental involvement. Design.—: Placentas from 65 women with polymerase chain reaction-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent histologic evaluation using Amsterdam consensus group criteria and terminology. Another 85 placentas from women without SARS-CoV-2 constituted the negative control group. A total of 64 of the placentas from the SARS-CoV-2-positive group underwent immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Results.—: Pathologic findings were divided into maternal vascular malperfusion, fetal vascular malperfusion, chronic inflammatory lesions, amniotic fluid infection sequence, increased perivillous fibrin, intervillous thrombi, increased subchorionic fibrin, meconium-laden macrophages (M-LMs) within fetal membranes, and chorangiosis. There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence of any specific placental histopathology between the SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative groups. There was no immunohistochemical evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in any of the 64 placentas that underwent staining for viral nucleocapsid protein. Conclusions.—: Our study results and a literature review suggest that there is no characteristic histopathology in most placentas from women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Likewise, direct placental involvement by SARS-CoV-2 is a rare event."
