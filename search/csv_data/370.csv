3690,Serologic Surveillance and Phylogenetic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Hospital Health Care Workers.,"Importance: It is unclear when, where, and by whom health care workers (HCWs) working in hospitals are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Objective: To determine how often and in what manner nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs in HCW groups with varying exposure to patients with COVID-19. Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study comprised 4 weekly measurements of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and collection of questionnaires from March 23 to June 25, 2020, combined with phylogenetic and epidemiologic transmission analyses at 2 university hospitals in the Netherlands. Included individuals were HCWs working in patient care for those with COVID-19, HCWs working in patient care for those without COVID-19, and HCWs not working in patient care. Data were analyzed from August through December 2020. Exposures: Varying work-related exposure to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Main outcomes and measures: The cumulative incidence of and time to SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in blood samples, were measured. Results: Among 801 HCWs, there were 439 HCWs working in patient care for those with COVID-19, 164 HCWs working in patient care for those without COVID-19, and 198 HCWs not working in patient care. There were 580 (72.4%) women, and the median (interquartile range) age was 36 (29-50) years. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was increased among HCWs working in patient care for those with COVID-19 (54 HCWs [13.2%; 95% CI, 9.9%-16.4%]) compared with HCWs working in patient care for those without COVID-19 (11 HCWs [6.7%; 95% CI, 2.8%-10.5%]; hazard ratio [HR], 2.25; 95% CI, 1.17-4.30) and HCWs not working in patient care (7 HCWs [3.6%; 95% CI, 0.9%-6.1%]; HR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.79-8.62). Among HCWs caring for patients with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence was increased among HCWs working on COVID-19 wards (32 of 134 HCWs [25.7%; 95% CI, 17.6%-33.1%]) compared with HCWs working on intensive care units (13 of 186 HCWs [7.1%; 95% CI, 3.3%-10.7%]; HR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.91-6.94), and HCWs working in emergency departments (7 of 102 HCWs [8.0%; 95% CI, 2.5%-13.1%]; HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.52-7.14). Epidemiologic data combined with phylogenetic analyses on COVID-19 wards identified 3 potential HCW-to-HCW transmission clusters. No patient-to-HCW transmission clusters could be identified in transmission analyses. Conclusions and relevance: This study found that HCWs working on COVID-19 wards were at increased risk for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection with an important role for HCW-to-HCW transmission. These findings suggest that infection among HCWs deserves more consideration in infection prevention practice."
3691,C4 article: Implications of COVID-19 in transplantation.,"A novel coronavirus has had global impact on individual health and health care delivery. In this C4 article, contributors discuss various aspects of transplantation including donor and recipient screening, management of infected patients, and prevention of coronavirus disease (COVID). Donor screening with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing (NAT) close to the time of procurement is recommended. Many programs are also screening all potential recipients at the time of admission. The management of COVID has evolved with remdesivir emerging as a new potential option for transplant recipients. Dexamethasone has also shown promise and convalescent plasma is under study. Prevention strategies for transplant candidates and recipients are paramount. Pediatric-specific issues are also discussed. Strategies for the psychological well-being of patients and providers are also imperative, in addition to future research priorities for transplantation."
3692,Impact of COVID-19 on migrants' access to primary care and implications for vaccine roll-out: a national qualitative study.,"Background: COVID-19 has led to big changes in UK primary care, including rapid digitalisation, with unknown impact on migrant groups. Aim: To understand the pandemic's impact on recently-arrived migrants and their access to primary health care, and implications for vaccine roll-out. Design and setting: Qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with primary care professionals (PCPs) and migrants in urban, suburban, and rural settings across England. Method: Sixty-four PCPs and administrative staff, and 17 recently-arrived migrants were recruited using purposive, convenience, and snowball sampling. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone. Data were analysed iteratively, informed by thematic analysis. Results: PCPs and migrants concurred that digitalisation and virtual consultations have amplified existing inequalities in access to health care for many migrants, due to a lack of digital literacy and access to technology, compounded by language barriers. PCPs were concerned that virtual consultations resulted in difficulties building trust and risked missing safeguarding cues. Both PCPs and migrants highlighted challenges around registering and accessing health care due to physical closure of surgeries, as well as indirect discrimination, language and communication barriers, and a lack of access to targeted and tailored COVID-19 information or interventions. Migrants reported a range of specific beliefs, from acceptance to mistrust, around COVID-19 and potential COVID-19 vaccines, often influenced by misinformation. Innovative opportunities were suggested, including translated digital health advice using text templates and YouTube; these merit further exploration. Conclusion: Pandemic-related changes to primary care delivery may become permanent; some migrant groups are at risk of digital exclusion and may need targeted additional support to access services. Solutions are needed to address vaccine hesitancy in marginalised groups to ensure equitable COVID-19 vaccine uptake."
3693,COVID-19 Vaccination: Status and Willingness to Be Vaccinated among Employees in Health and Welfare Care in Germany.,"Healthcare workers are at particular risk due to their occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, they belong to the top priority group for vaccination. However, earlier studies show that nursing staff in particular are hesitant to be inoculated. This study presents the current picture with regard to vaccination status, willingness, vaccine preference, and reasons for or against a COVID-19 vaccination among health and welfare workers. An online survey was conducted between 4 March and 10 April 2021 among professional associations and providers of health and social services. Data sets of n = 3401 participants were analyzed. Of these, 62% stated that they had already been vaccinated at least once. A further 22% wanted to be vaccinated, while 6.6% were still hesitant and 9% refused to be vaccinated. Preference was given to predominantly mRNA-based vaccines. Altogether, there was a high vaccination rate and a great willingness to be vaccinated (>80%) across all professional groups and fields of work. Among nursing staff, the total figure was 83.5%. The percentage was highest in geriatric care at 87.5%. Contrary to findings of earlier surveys, vaccination willingness has risen in all professional groups during the course of the vaccination campaign in Germany."
3694,Evaluation of Serologic Changes of IgG and IgM Antibodies Associated with SARS-COV-2 in Cancer Patients: A Cohort Seroprevalence Study.,"Background: While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spreads, there is increasing evidence to suggest the elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and following morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Serology testing using ELISA proposes major advantages as a diagnostic and preventive tool to control the present SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. This cohort study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in asymptomatic cancer patients. Methods: Patients in all age groups and with any type of cancer who have been in remission or have stable disease and received their latest anticancer therapy over 2 months ago included in the study. All patients were evaluated for COVID-19 symptoms and only asymptomatic patients were enrolled for serologic screening for SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples evaluated serologically for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: A total of 168 asymptomatic cancer patients were included in the study. Of the 168 cases with a history of cancer who were asymptomatic for Covid-19, 29 cases (17.26%) had a positive serological test. Conclusion: In conclusion, in the present study asymptomatic cancer patients revealed 17% seropositivity, approximately equal to the general population of the same age, sex, geographic region, and epidemic status. Asymptomatic infections should further be investigated and considered as playing an important role in the COVID-19 transmission chain."
3695,Suspected Recurrence of Symptomatic COVID-19: Management During Inpatient Psychiatric Treatment.,"The widespread prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) means that inpatient psychiatric units will necessarily manage patients who have COVID-19 that is comorbid with acute psychiatric symptoms. We report a case of recurrence of respiratory symptoms and positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in a patient on an inpatient psychiatric unit occurring 42 days after the initial positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, 38 days after initial symptom resolution, and 30 days after the first of 3 negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Over the course of the admission, the patient was safely initiated on clozapine. Recent literature on COVID-19's potential recurrence and neuropsychiatric effects is reviewed and implications for the management of COVID-19 on inpatient psychiatric units are discussed. In the era of COVID-19 and our still-developing understanding of this illness, psychiatrists' role as advocates and collaborators in our patients' physical health care has become even more critical."
3696,Validation of a multiplex flow immunoassay for detection of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in dried blood spots.,"Background: Dried blood spots (DBS) are an established specimen type for clinical testing given their low cost, ease of collection and storage, and convenient shipping capabilities through the postal system. These attributes are complementary to the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing, which may be used to inform community seroprevalence rates. Methods: The Luminex xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen assay utilizes magnetic beads labeled with three viral antigens (nucleocapsid [NC], receptor binding domain [RBD], spike S1 subunit) to detect anti-viral IgG-class antibodies, and has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in serum and plasma. This assay was modified for use with DBS and validated against paired sera tested by one of two reference assays: the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA or the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA. Results: 159 paired DBS and serum specimens analyzed using the modified Luminex xMAP assay on DBS and the reference methods on serum showed an overall concordance of 96.9% (154/159). Use of multivariate pattern recognition software (CLIR) for post-analytical interpretation of the Luminex xMAP DBS assay results, instead of manufacturer provided interpretive thresholds, increased overall qualitative result concordance to 99.4% (158/159) between the modified Luminex xMAP DBS and reference results. Conclusions: Use of DBS for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 provides comparable results to those obtained using serum. DBS concordance was improved with multivariate pattern recognition software (CLIR). We demonstrate that DBS are a reliable specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection using the modified Luminex xMAP assay."
3697,E-health roadmap for COVID-19 vaccine coverage in Iran.,"Background: Vaccination is the effective and long-term pharmacological solution to deal with COVID-19. Information technology (IT) and electronic immunization can be effective in accelerating and improving vaccine coverage. The aim of this paper is to develop multi-dimensional framework of e-health roadmap to response Covod-19 pandemic and examine the role of IT for improving vaccine distribution in Iran. Methods: The study methodology was based on a two-stage Delphi method which included literature studies at the beginning. Key steps in creating a roadmap in this study include definition, development and evaluation. The initial conceptual model was developed after literature review. Proposed roadmap was reviewed and evaluated in two stages based on the Delphi method by experts in the fields of E-health. Results: In the e-health roadmap model, 14 stages of vaccine distribution were presented in three phases of vaccination and then were determined the type of technology in each phase. The 4 conceptual models were approved based on the two stages Delphi approach in a survey of 14 e-health experts. In the second phase of the Delphi process, the selected items were sent back to the specialists to verification. Then e-health roadmap was confirmed by experts and was finalized the approved model. Conclusions: The technology-based roadmap is one plan in the form of a transfer strategy that aligns goals with specific technical solutions and helps to meet them. This roadmap empowers decision makers to decide on alternative paths and achieve goals."
3698,An Appraisal of the Current Scenario in Vaccine Research for COVID-19.,"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has drawn global attention, affecting millions, disrupting economies and healthcare modalities. With its high infection rate, COVID-19 has caused a colossal health crisis worldwide. While information on the comprehensive nature of this infectious agent, SARS-CoV-2, still remains obscure, ongoing genomic studies have been successful in identifying its genomic sequence and the presenting antigen. These may serve as promising, potential therapeutic targets in the effective management of COVID-19. In an attempt to establish herd immunity, massive efforts have been directed and driven toward developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. This review, in this direction, is aimed at providing the current scenario and future perspectives in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2."
3699,"COVID-19: Current knowledge in clinical features, immunological responses, and vaccine development.","The COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded to be the most challenging global health crisis in a century. In 11 months since its first emergence, according to WHO, the causative infectious agent SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 100 million people and claimed more than 2.15 million lives worldwide. Moreover, the world has raced to understand the virus and natural immunity and to develop vaccines. Thus, within a short 11 months a number of highly promising COVID-19 vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed and are now being deployed via emergency use authorization for immunization. Although a considerable number of review contributions are being published, all of them attempt to capture only a specific aspect of COVID-19 or its therapeutic approaches based on ever-expanding information. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview to conceptually thread together the latest information on global epidemiology and mitigation strategies, clinical features, viral pathogenesis and immune responses, and the current state of vaccine development."
