960,Analytical and Clinical Analysis of Two Automated Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassays in Pre-Pandemic and Pandemic Patient Populations.,"Background: In the absence of a safe, effective vaccine, the worldwide spread of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will continue. Laboratory tests with ideal precision, sensitivity, and specificity should be used in public health and clinical settings to gauge the extent of virus exposure. Toward this end, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and the Roche Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays. Methods: Quality control, pooled COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 patient specimens were used for the imprecision study. Two hundred and forty-six specimens from 70 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were tested to study the sensitivity. Seventy-three non-COVID-19 control specimens were measured to study the specificity. All specimens were analyzed by both assays. Results: Total analytic variability (CV) of the negative and positive controls were 5.5% and 3.6% for the Abbott assay and 4.5% and 1.9% for the Roche assay. Both assays demonstrated 100% qualitative reproducibility of negative and positive controls. The clinical specificities of the Abbott and the Roche assays were 100% (95% CI: 94%-100%) and 97% (95% CI: 90%-100%), respectively. The clinical sensitivities of the Abbott assay were 49% (95% CI: 41%-56%), 86% (95% CI: 74%-93%), and 100% (95% CI: 76%-100%) for samples collected at 0-6 days, 7-13 days, and ≥14 days after the first RT-PCR, while the sensitivities of the Roche assay were 55% (95% CI: 47%-62%), 86% (95% CI: 74%-93%), and 100% (95% CI: 76%-100%). Conclusions: This study demonstrates similar analytical and clinical performance of the Abbott and the Roche SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, but the Roche assay may be slightly more sensitive for patients tested within 0-6 days after first positive RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2.COVID-19 is a respiratory infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory tests with ideal precision, sensitivity, and specificity should be used in public health and clinical settings. We analyzed analytical and clinical performance of the Roche and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in pre-pandemic and pandemic patient populations. Additionally, we analyzed the sensitivity of both assays in patients at different stages of the disease. The 2 assays showed similar analytical and clinical performance, but the Roche assay may be slightly more sensitive for patients tested within 0-6 days after first positive RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings help other clinical labs select appropriate assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing."
961,SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and autoimmune diseases amidst the COVID-19 crisis.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become challenging even for the most durable healthcare systems. It seems that vaccination, one of the most effective public-health interventions, presents a ray of hope to end the pandemic by achieving herd immunity. In this review, we aimed to cover aspects of the current knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines and vaccine candidates in the light of autoimmune inflammatory diseases (AIIDs) and to analyze their potential in terms of safety and effectiveness in patients with AIIDs. Therefore, a focused narrative review was carried out to predict the possible implications of different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which confer distinct immune mechanisms to establish immune response and protection against COVID-19: whole virus (inactivated or weakened), viral vector (replicating and non-replicating), nucleic acid (RNA, DNA), and protein-based (protein subunit, virus-like particle). Still, there is uncertainty among patients with AIIDs and clinicians about the effectiveness and safety of the new vaccines. There are a variety of approaches towards building a protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Only high-quality clinical trials would clarify the underlying immunological mechanisms of the newly implemented vaccines/adjuvants in patients living with AIIDs."
962,Assessment of Multiplex Digital Droplet RT-PCR as a Diagnostic Tool for SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Nasopharyngeal Swabs and Saliva Samples.,"Background: Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs is currently the reference COVID-19 diagnosis method but exhibits imperfect sensitivity. Methods: We developed a multiplex reverse transcription-digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR) assay, targeting 6 SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions, and evaluated it on nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples collected from 130 COVID-19 positive or negative ambulatory individuals, who presented symptoms suggestive of mild or moderate SARS-CoV2 infection. Results: For the nasopharyngeal swab samples, the results obtained using the 6-plex RT-ddPCR and RT-qPCR assays were all concordant. The 6-plex RT-ddPCR assay was more sensitive than RT-qPCR (85% versus 62%) on saliva samples from patients with positive nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusion: Multiplex RT-ddPCR represents an alternative and complementary tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19, in particular to control RT-qPCR ambiguous results. It can also be applied to saliva for repetitive sampling and testing individuals for whom nasopharyngeal swabbing is not possible."
963,Assessment of humoral responses in COVID-19 using various quantitative antibody tests.,"Background: Quantitative antibody tests are expected to be useful in diagnostics of COVID-19 and investigation of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. To make it proper to perform them, understanding of the immunological aspects is critically important. The present study aimed to assess humoral responses in COVID-19 using various quantitative antibody tests. Methods: Four quantitative antibody tests that are different in targeted antigens, detectable immunoglobulin classes and avidity were used. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Antibody titres of 117 samples collected from 24 COVID-19 patients and 23 non-COVID-19 patients were measured to evaluate correlations between different tests. For 24 COVID-19 patients, antibody titres measured at various time points after the onset or the RT-PCR diagnosis were subjected to assessment of humoral responses. Results: Correlations between tests were observed to some degree, although there were discrepancies putatively due to differences in measurement principle. Seronegative COVID-19 was diagnosed for some patients, in whom antibody titres were less than the cut-off value in each test throughout the time courses. IgG seroconversion without prior IgM seroconversion most frequently occurred, while predominance of IgM responses over IgG responses was observed in some severe cases. Viral burdens estimated according to threshold cycle values at the RT-PCR seemed to impact antibody responses. Conclusions: The results provide insights into the nature of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 and diagnostic performance of antibody tests."

966,A novel single nucleotide polymorphism assay for the detection of N501Y SARS-CoV-2 variants.,"The N501Y mutation in SARS-CoV-2 variants found in several strains from the UK, South Africa and Brazil has been linked to increased transmission. In order to discriminate N501Y variants quickly, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discrimination assay was designed and validated. It was then deployed prospectively in 757 nasopharyngeal swabs. Validation of the novel variant discrimination assay corroborated the results in all validation panel samples (n = 63) through sequencing. This novel variant discrimination assay was then deployed prospectively in 757 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs during the last week of January 2021. N501Y was found in 206 (27.4 %) of the samples: 94 (28.2 %) men and 112 (26.85 %) women (p = 0.73). The patients in whom it was identified had a mean age of 47.8 ± 25.8 (0-96) years, similar to that of patients without this variant: 51.7 ± 25.9 (0-104) years (p = 0.06). 501Y variant was confirmed in 34 samples by sequence method and 501 N wild type was confirmed in 67. This method is sensitive, specific, and simple to apply in any microbiology lab."
967,"SARS-CoV-2 Infection: New Molecular, Phylogenetic, and Pathogenetic Insights. Efficacy of Current Vaccines and the Potential Risk of Variants.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly discovered coronavirus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 has rapidly become a public health emergency of international concern. Although remarkable scientific achievements have been reached since the beginning of the pandemic, the knowledge behind this novel coronavirus, in terms of molecular and pathogenic characteristics and zoonotic potential, is still relatively limited. Today, there is a vaccine, or rather several vaccines, which, for the first time in the history of highly contagious infectious diseases that have plagued mankind, has been manufactured in just one year. Currently, four vaccines are licensed by regulatory agencies, and they use RNA or viral vector technologies. The positive effects of the vaccination campaign are being felt in many parts of the world, but the disappearance of this new infection is still far from being a reality, as it is also threatened by the presence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants that could undermine the effectiveness of the vaccine, hampering the immunization control efforts. Indeed, the current findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is adapting to transmission in humans more efficiently, while further divergence from the initial archetype should be considered. In this review, we aimed to provide a collection of the current knowledge regarding the molecular, phylogenetic, and pathogenetic insights into SARS-CoV-2. The most recent findings obtained with respect to the impact of novel emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the development and implementation of vaccines are highlighted."
968,"The existence, spread, and strategies for environmental monitoring and control of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental media.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the most influential infectious disease to emerge in the early 21st century. The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a great many deaths and has had a negative impact on the world's economic development. The etiological agent of COVID-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2, which is highly infectious and variable, can be transmitted through different environmental media (gaseous, liquid, and solid). There are many unanswered questions surrounding this virus. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the latest global COVID-19 epidemic situation, SARS-CoV-2 variants, the progress in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine use, and the existence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in gaseous, liquid, and solid media, with particular emphasis on the prevention and control of further spread of the disease. This review aims to help people worldwide to become more familiar with the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental media, so as targeted measures to fight the epidemic, reduce deaths, and restore the economy can be implemented under the pressure of global SARS-CoV-2 vaccine shortages."
969,Coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines: landscape of global studies and potential risks.,"With the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the importance of vaccines in epidemic prevention and public health has become even more obvious than ever. However, the emergence of multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants worldwide has raised concerns about the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we review the characteristics of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in five platforms and the latest clinical trial results of them. In addition, we further discuss future directions for the research and development of the next generation of COVID-19 vaccines. We also summarize the serious adverse events reported recently after the large-scale vaccination with the current COVID-19 vaccines, including the thromboembolism caused by the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines."
