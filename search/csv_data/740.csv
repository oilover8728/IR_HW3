7390,Regenerated silica-based RNA purification columns to address the short supply of RNA purification kits for COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Background: RT-qPCR technique is the current world-wide method used for the early detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA in the suspected clinical samples. Viral RNA extraction is the key pre-analytical step for SARS-CoV2 detection which often achieved using commercial RNA-extraction kits. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, bulk production and the supply chains for the commercial RNA-extraction kit have been seriously compromised. The shortage of commercial RNA-extraction kit is even more acute in developing country. Furthermore, use of one-off design RNA-columns can generate plastic wastes that have an environmental pollution effect. Methods and results: To address these issues, in this study, we used warm alkaline solution containing Triton X-100 for the complete removal of the residual SARS-CoV2 RNA from the used RNA-binding silica column. Columns regenerated using the alkaline solution have the viral RNA purification capability that is comparable to the fresh silica columns. We also demonstrated that RNA-binding silica columns can be regenerated and reused for a minimum of five-times. Conclusions: Therefore, the use of the RNA-column regeneration method may benefits several SARS-CoV2 diagnostic laboratories throughout the world by cutting down the requirement of commercial RNA-purification column."
7391,Direct-acting oral anticoagulants use prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and associations with 30-day clinical outcomes.,"Background: It is unclear if direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) use before hospitalization due to COVID-19 diagnosis would potentially impact the severity and clinical outcomes thereafter. We compared 30-day hospitalization/re-hospitalization and clinical outcomes between patients on chronic DOAC therapy and patients not on oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy at time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: We used data from TriNetX, a global federated health research network. Patients aged ≥18 years who were treated with DOACs at time of COVID-19 diagnosis between 20 January 2020 and 28 February 2021 were included, and matched with patients not on OAC therapy from the same period. All patients were followed-up at 30-days after COVID-19 diagnosis. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, hospitalization/re-hospitalization, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Results: 738,423 patients were included. After propensity score matching (PSM), 26,006 patients remained in the study (13,003 on DOACs; 13,003 not on OAC). DOAC-treated patients (mean age 67.1 ± 15.4 years, 52.2% male) had higher relative risks (RRs) and lower 30-days event-free survival as compared to patients not on OAC for all-cause mortality (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12-1.44; Log-Rank test p = 0.010), hospitalization/re-hospitalization (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.64-1.82; Log-Rank test p < 0.001) and VTE (RR 4.51, 95% CI 3.91-5.82; Log-Rank test p < 0.001), but not for ICH (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.54-1.51; Log-Rank test p = 0.513). Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients, previous DOAC therapy at time of diagnosis was not associated with improved clinical outcomes or lower hospitalization/re-hospitalization rate compared to patients not taking OAC therapy."
7392,Evaluation of mobile real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), calls for prompt and accurate diagnosis and rapid turnaround time for test results to limit transmission. Here, we evaluated two independent molecular assays, the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 test, and the Precision Biomonitoring TripleLock SARS-CoV-2 test on a field-deployable point-of-care real-time PCR instrument, Franklin three9, in combination with Biomeme M1 Sample Prep Cartridge Kit for RNA 2.0 (M1) manual extraction system for rapid, specific, and sensitive detection of SARS-COV-2 in cell culture, human, and animal clinical samples. The Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 assay, which simultaneously detects two viral targets, the orf1ab and S genes, and the Precision Biomonitoring TripleLock SARS-CoV-2 assay that targets the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and the envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2 were highly sensitive and detected as low as 15 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per reaction. In addition, the two assays were specific and showed no cross-reactivity with Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and other common human respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens. Also, both assays were highly reproducible across different operators and instruments. When used to test animal samples, both assays equally detected SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials in the swabs from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. The M1 lysis buffer completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 10 min at room temperature enabling safe handling of clinical samples. Collectively, these results show that the Biomeme and Precision Biomonitoring TripleLock SARS-CoV-2 mobile testing platforms could reliably and promptly detect SARS-CoV-2 in both human and animal clinical samples in approximately an hour and can be used in remote areas or health care settings not traditionally serviced by a microbiology laboratory."
7393,Comparative evaluation of nasopharyngeal swab and saliva specimens for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Japanese patients with COVID-19.,"Considering the issues of shortage of medical resources and the invasiveness and infection risk involved in the collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens, there is a need for an effective alternative test specimen for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Here, we investigated suitability of saliva as a non-invasively obtained specimen for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Japanese patients with COVID-19. In total, 28 paired clinical specimens of saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 12 patients at various time points after symptom onset. Each specimen was assayed using reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the BD MAX open system using primers and probes targeting the N-gene. The saliva and nasopharyngeal swab specimens showed 19 and 15 positive results, respectively. No invalid (PCR inhibition) result was observed for any specimen. The qualitative results of each specimen obtained in the period immediately after symptom onset were similar. Three convalescent patients presented saliva-positive results, whereas their nasopharyngeal swabs were negative at four different time points, suggesting that saliva may be superior to nasopharyngeal swabs in terms of obtaining stable assay result of SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, our results suggest that saliva can potentially serve as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs as a specimen for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR. As saliva can be collected by patients themselves, it may be an effective way to overcome the shortage of personal protective equipment and specimen sampling tools."
7394,COVID-19 Vaccine Perceptions Among Patients With Chronic Disease in a Large Gastroenterology and Hepatology Practice.,"Introduction: To assess beliefs about safety, effectiveness, and delivery of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine among chronic Gastroenterology and Hepatology patients at an academic health system. Methods: We asked about vaccine beliefs, vaccine concerns, and preferred location to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: A total of 1,215 patients responded (response rate: 37%). Most patients believed that vaccines are safe, effective, and that they would take the COVID-19 vaccine at a medical office or pharmacy. However, we identified important sociodemographic factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Discussion: Patients have high level of trust in the COVID-19 vaccine and are likely to follow their specialist physician recommendations."
7395,Chest Radiography in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Correlation with Clinical Course.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. A definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 is made after a positive result is obtained on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. In Singapore, rigorous contact tracing was practised to contain the spread of the virus. Nasal swabs and chest radiographs (CXR) were also taken from individuals who were suspected to be infected by COVID-19 upon their arrival at a centralised screening centre. From our experience, about 40% of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 had initial CXR that appeared ""normal"". In this case series, we described the temporal evolution of COVID-19 in patients with an initial ""normal"" CXR. Since CXR has limited sensitivity and specificity in COVID-19, it is not suitable as a first-line diagnostic tool. However, when CXR changes become unequivocally abnormal, close monitoring is recommended to manage potentially severe COVID-19 pneumonia."
7396,Structural basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.,"Purpose of review: The spike glycoprotein plays a critical role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by recognizing the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mediating fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. It is also the major target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. This review summarizes recent studies on the structure and function of spike glycoprotein, which revealed the structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent findings: SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, similar to those of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, spontaneously samples different prefusion states with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) adopting 'up' or 'down' conformations, and the RBD 'down' to 'up' conformational change is required for ACE2 binding. Receptor binding and spike glycoprotein priming by host proteases such as furin and transmembrane protease serine 2 induce pre to postfusion conformational changes of the spike trimer that enable membrane fusion. Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 were elucidated at atomic resolution using high-resolution crystal structures. These structures, together with adapted and remodeled SARS-CoV-2 strains, further revealed critical residues of the spike glycoprotein for SARS-CoV-2 infection and cross-species transmission. Summary: Recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein provide important structural knowledge for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and cross-species transmission."

7398,Challenges and Experiences of Dental Medicine in Combating the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The world has been suffering incredible loss due to a pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCoV). The disease was later named the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The transmission routes of COVID-19 include respiratory transmission, aerosol transmission, and contact transmission. Many dental diagnosis and treatment procedures generate droplets and aerosols, and thus both dental staff and patients are at a high risk of becoming infected and transmitting COVID-19 to others. Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital is a comprehensive hospital with 18 craniofacial-/dental-related departments. During the outbreak of COVID-19 and up to the present date, there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in this hospital thanks to strict protocols for infection prevention and control. In this communication, we would like to share with the prosthodontic community our experience in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in our dental departments and hope it will contribute to the worldwide efforts to overcome the global COVID-19 pandemic."
7399,[Anosmia and ageusia as primary symptoms of COVID-19].,"This case report describes a physician in the early 30ies with subjective anosmia and ageusia as the major presenting symptoms of COVID-19. Apart from a week of slightly runny nose when coming from cold to warm air, the only symptom was a sudden onset of persistent anosmia and ageusia. Two weeks after normalisation of the mild sino-nasal symptoms, the patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and anosmia was verified with Sniffin' Sticks tests. Hypogeusia was verified with taste screening and two validated taste tests. Olfactory and gustatory loss may be underestimated symptoms of COVID-19."
