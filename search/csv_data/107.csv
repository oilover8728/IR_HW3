1060,Laboratory Management and Quality Control Practice of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Detection.,"Objective: A positive result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection provides critical laboratory evidence for clinical confirmed diagnosis, pandemic status evaluation, a pandemic prevention plan, treatment of infected people with symptoms, and protection of uninfected people. This study aims to provide a practical reference for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-related research and detection. Methods: Our laboratory has established policies combining personnel management and quality control practices for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection during the pandemic. Results: In this article, we describe cross-department personnel management and key points of personal protection and quality control in the testing process. We also report on the differences in detection and the compatibility between different brand kits. Conclusion: It is critical to maintain a standard and accurate laboratory operation for nucleic acid testing."

1062,"Variable Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection in European Expert Laboratories: External Quality Assessment, June and July 2020.","During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, robust detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a key element for clinical management and to interrupt transmission chains. We organized an external quality assessment (EQA) of molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 for European expert laboratories. An EQA panel composed of 12 samples, containing either SARS-CoV-2 at different concentrations to evaluate sensitivity or other respiratory viruses to evaluate specificity of SARS-CoV-2 testing, was distributed to 68 laboratories in 35 countries. Specificity samples included seasonal human coronaviruses hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43, as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, and human influenza viruses A and B. Sensitivity results differed among laboratories, particularly for low-concentration SARS-CoV-2 samples. Results indicated that performance was mostly independent of the selection of specific extraction or PCR methods."
1063,SARS-CoV-2: Targeted managements and vaccine development.,"Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in diverse outcomes. The symptoms appear to be more severe in males older than 65 and people with underlying health conditions; approximately one in five individuals could be at risk worldwide. The virus's sequence was rapidly established days after the first cases were reported and identified an RNA virus from the Coronaviridae family closely related to a Betacoronavirus virus found in bats in China. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, and with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the only ones to cause severe diseases. Lessons from these two previous outbreaks guided the identification of critical therapeutic targets such as the spike viral proteins promoting the virus's cellular entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on the surface of multiple types of eukaryotic cells. Although several therapeutic agents are currently evaluated, none seems to provide a clear path for a cure. Also, various types of vaccines are developed in record time to address the urgency of efficient SARS-CoV-2 prevention. Currently, 58 vaccines are evaluated in clinical trials, including 11 in phase III, and 3 of them reported efficacy above 90 %. The results so far from the clinical trials suggest the availability of multiple effective vaccines within months."
1064,Advances in gene-based vaccine platforms to address the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has spread across the globe at an unprecedented rate since its first emergence in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. Scientific communities around the world have been rigorously working to develop a potent vaccine to combat COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), employing conventional and novel vaccine strategies. Gene-based vaccine platforms based on viral vectors, DNA, and RNA, have shown promising results encompassing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in previous studies, supporting their implementation for COVID-19 vaccine development. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently authorized the emergency use of two RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. We review current gene-based vaccine candidates proceeding through clinical trials, including their antigenic targets, delivery vehicles, and route of administration. Important features of previous gene-based vaccine developments against other infectious diseases are discussed in guiding the design and development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and future derivatives."
1065,COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest threat to public health in a century. Through hard work and ingenuity, scientists have developed a number of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 disease. However, demand far outstrips supply and countries around the world are competing for available vaccines. This review describes how low- and middle-income countries access COVID-19 vaccines, what is being done to distribute vaccines fairly, as well as the challenges ahead."
1066,A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike antibody detection using three commercially available automated immunoassays.,"Introduction: Commercially available serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 detect antibodies to either the nucleocapsid or spike protein. Here we compare the performance of the Beckman-Coulter SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG assay to that of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG and Roche Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid total antibody assays. In addition, we document the trend in nucleocapsid and spike antibodies in sequential samples collected from convalescent plasma donors. Methods: Plasma or serum samples from 20 individual SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive inpatients (n = 172), 20 individual convalescent donors with a previous RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 20), were deemed positive SARS-CoV-2 samples. RT-PCR-negative inpatients (n = 24), and 109 pre-SARS-CoV-2 samples were determined to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. Samples were assayed by the Abbott, Roche, and Beckman assays. Results: All three assays demonstrated 100% specificity. Abbott, Beckman, and Roche platforms had sensitivities of 98%, 93%, and 90% respectively, with the difference in sensitivity attributed primarily to samples from immunocompromised patients. After the exclusion of samples immunocompromised patients, all assays exhibited ≥ 95% sensitivity. In sequential samples collected from the same individuals, the Roche nucleocapsid antibody assay demonstrated continually increasing signal intensity, with maximal values observed at the last time point examined. In contrast, the Beckman spike IgG antibody signal peaked between 14 and 28 days post positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and steadily declined in subsequent samples. Subsequent collections 51-200 days (median of 139 days) post positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from five inpatients and five convalescent donors revealed that spike and nucleocapsid antibodies remained detectable for several months after confirmed infection. Conclusions: The three assays are sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Nucleocapsid and spike antibodies were detectable for up to 200 days post-positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR but demonstrated markedly different trends in signal intensity."
1067,Quantitative Insight into Immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which initiated as an endemic from China, converted into a pandemic disease worldwide within a couple of months' time. This has led researchers from all over the world to come together to find and develop possible curative or preventive strategies, including vaccine development, drug repurposing, plasma therapy, drug discovery, and cytokine-based therapies. Herein, we are providing, a summarized overview of immunopathology of the SARS-CoV-2 along with various therapeutic strategies undertaken to COVID-19 with a vision for their possible outcome. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-7, G-CSF, IP-10, TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and IL-2 in severe cases of COVID-19 have been observed. Immune responses play significant roles in the determination of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Thus, exploring the underlying mechanism of the immune system response to SARS-CoV-2 infection would help in the prediction of disease course and selection of intensive care and therapeutic strategy. As an effort toward developing possible therapeutics for COVID-19, we highlighted different types of vaccines, which are under clinical trials, and also discussed the impact of genome variability on efficacy of vaccine under development."
1068,Hospital-Based Donor Recruitment and Predonation Serologic Testing for COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma.,"Objectives: Serologic testing for antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in potential donors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) may not be performed until after blood donation. A hospital-based recruitment program for CCP may be an efficient way to identify potential donors prospectively. Methods: Patients who recovered from known or suspected COVID-19 were identified and recruited through medical record searches and public appeals in March and April 2020. Participants were screened with a modified donor history questionnaire and, if eligible, were asked for consent and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM). Participants positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG were referred for CCP collection. Results: Of 179 patients screened, 128 completed serologic testing and 89 were referred for CCP donation. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 23 of 51 participants with suspected COVID-19 and 66 of 77 participants with self-reported COVID-19 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level met the US Food and Drug Administration criteria for ""high-titer"" CCP in 39% of participants confirmed by PCR, as measured by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay. A wide range of SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were observed. Conclusions: A hospital-based CCP donor recruitment program can prospectively identify potential CCP donors. Variability in SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels has implications for the selection of CCP units for transfusion."
1069,A follow-up study of respiratory and physical function after discharge in patients with redetectable positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid results following recovery from COVID-19.,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the respiratory and physical function of patients who retested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA during post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rehabilitation. Methods: A total of 302 discharged COVID-19 patients were included. Discharged patients were followed up for 14 days to 6 months. The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, Borg rating of perceived exertion, and manual muscle testing (MMT) scores on day 14 and at 6 months after discharge were compared between the redetectable positive (RP) and non-RP (NRP) groups. Prognoses of respiratory and physical function were compared between patients who recovered from moderate and severe COVID-19. Results: Of the study patients, 7.6% were RP. The proportion of patients who used antiviral drugs was significantly lower in the RP group than in the NRP group. There were no differences in mMRC, Borg, or MMT scores within the RP and NRP groups. The mMRC, Borg, and MMT scores were worse for patients with severe disease when compared to those with moderate disease at both follow-up time points. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients who did not take antiviral drugs were more likely to be RP after discharge. The recovery of respiratory and physical function was not related to re-positivity during rehabilitation, but was related to disease severity during hospitalization."
