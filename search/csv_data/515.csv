5140,Histopathologic evaluation of placentas after diagnosis of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.,"Background: The impact of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection on placental histopathology is not well known. Objective: To determine if any significant placental histopathologic changes occur after the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy and whether these changes are correlated with the presence or absence of symptoms associated with the infection. Study design: A retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who delivered at a single center from April 9, 2020 to April 27, 2020, and had placental specimens reviewed by the Department of Pathology. Women with singleton gestations and laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were eligible for inclusion. Historical controls selected from a cohort of women who delivered 6 months before the study period were matched in a 1:1 fashion by weeks of gestation at delivery. Histopathologic characteristics were evaluated in each placenta, and the incidence of these findings was compared between placentas of those who received a diagnosis of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and historical controls, and between placentas from patients with or without typical symptoms related to the infection. Statistical analyses included the use of Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test for the comparison of categorical and continuous variables. Statistical significance was defined as a P value of <.05. Results: A total of 50 placentas after the diagnosis of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and 50 historical controls were analyzed. Among the placentas from patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, 3 (6%) were preterm (33 3/7, 34 6/7, and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation), 16 (32%) were from patients with typical symptoms related to the infection, and 34 (68%) were from patients without typical symptoms related to the infection. All patients had received a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the third trimester. Decidual vasculopathy was not visualized in any of the placentas from patients diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. There was no statistically significant difference in placental histopathologic characteristics between the groups. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test results for all neonates at 24 hours of life were negative. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, there are no significant placental histopathologic changes that occur after the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in women during the third trimester of pregnancy compared with a gestational age-matched historical control group. Similar incidences of histopathologic findings were also discovered when comparing placentas from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection with or without the presence of symptoms typically related to the infection."
5141,Evaluation of automated molecular tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pooled nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens.,"Background: Pooling of samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing in low-prevalence settings has been used as an effective strategy to expand testing capacity and mitigate challenges with the shortage of supplies. We evaluated two automated molecular test systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pooled specimens. Methods: Pooled nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were tested by Qiagen QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel (QIAstat) or Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert), and the results were compared to that of standard RT-qPCR tests without pooling. Results: In nasopharyngeal specimens, the sensitivity/specificity of the pool testing approach, with 5 and 10 specimens per pool, were 77%/100% (n = 105) and 74.1%/100% (n = 260) by QIAstat, and 97.1%/100% (n = 250) and 100%/99.5% (n = 200) by Xpert, respectively. Pool testing of saliva (10 specimens per pool; n = 150) by Xpert resulted in 87.5% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity compared to individual tests. Pool size of 5 or 10 specimens did not significantly affect the difference of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (CT ) from standard testing. RT-qPCR CT values obtained with pool testing by both QIAstat and Xpert were positively correlated with that of individual testing (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.85 to 0.99, p < 0.05). However, the CT values from Xpert were significantly stronger (p < 0.01, paired t test) than that of QIAstat in a subset of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, with mean differences of -4.3 ± 2.43 and -4.6 ± 2 for individual and pooled tests, respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Xpert SARS-CoV-2 can be utilized for pooled sample testing for COVID-19 screening in low-prevalence settings providing significant cost savings and improving throughput without affecting test quality."

5143,Reduced humoral response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine in kidney transplant recipients without prior exposure to the virus.,"COVID-19 is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. There are no efficacy data available regarding these patients with any of the available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We analyzed the humoral response following full vaccination with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) in 136 kidney transplant recipients, and compared it to 25 controls. In order to exclude prior exposure to the virus, only participants with negative serology to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were included. All controls developed a positive response to spike protein, while only 51 of 136 transplant recipients (37.5%) had positive serology (p < .001). Mean IgG anti-spike level was higher in the controls (31.05 [41.8] vs. 200.5 [65.1] AU/mL, study vs. control, respectively, p < .001). Variables associated with null humoral response were older age (odds ratio 1.66 [95% confidence interval 1.17-2.69]), high-dose corticosteroids in the last 12 months (1.3 [1.09-1.86]), maintenance with triple immunosuppression (1.43 [1.06-2.15]), and regimen that includes mycophenolate (1.47 [1.26-2.27]). There was a similar rate of side effects between controls and recipients, and no correlation was found between the presence of symptoms and seroconversion. Our findings suggest that most kidney transplant recipients remain at high risk for COVID-19 despite vaccination. Further studies regarding possible measures to increase recipient's response to vaccination are required."
5144,"Critical Considerations for COVID-19 Vaccination of Refugees, Immigrants, and Migrants.","As COVID-19 vaccines are distributed across the United States, it is essential to address the pandemic's disproportionate impact on refugee, immigrant, and migrant (RIM) communities. Although the National Academies Press Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine provides recommendations for an equitable vaccine campaign, implementation remains. Practical considerations for vaccine rollout include identifying and overcoming barriers to vaccination among RIM communities. To identify barriers, information regarding vaccine beliefs and practices must be incorporated into the pandemic response. To overcome barriers, effective communication, convenience of care, and community engagement are essential. Taking these actions now can improve health among RIM communities."
5145,"Using syndromic measures of mortality to capture the dynamics of COVID-19 in Java, Indonesia, in the context of vaccination rollout.","Background: As in many countries, quantifying COVID-19 spread in Indonesia remains challenging due to testing limitations. In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths are rising across the island. Methods: We used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine rollout. Results: C19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan, substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign. Conclusions: Syndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained. Increases in control in the relatively short-term will likely yield large, synergistic increases in vaccine impact."

5147,[Treatment strategy for gastrointestinal tumor under the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China].,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has become a public health emergency in China. Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (>37.3℃), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage ≥ 2/rectal cancer T stage ≥ 3/unresectable colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP."
5148,Rapid adaptation and continuous performance evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 envelope gene (E-gene) real-time RT-PCR assays to support the hospital surge in test demand.,"We describe the timely adaption of both published WHO E-gene protocol and commercially available LightMix Modular E-gene assay to the test platform (ABI 7900 Fast real-time analyzer and TaqMan Fast One-step Virus Master Mix) available in an accredited tertiary hospital laboratory with an on-going evaluation to ensure the provision of quality service within the time constraint. The LightMix Modular E-gene was slightly more sensitive when compared to the WHO E-gene, both analytically and diagnostically. The assay was recommended for screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With the availability of technically competent staff through continuous training, the provision of round-the-clock service is feasible despite the test is of high complexity. The thermal cycling duration of the adapted LightMix E-gene and WHO E-gene is shortened by half and one hour respectively and allows the number of runs to double when 24-h round-the-clock service is provided. An increase in testing capacity could support surges in testing demand, which is essential to control the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to prevent potential overwhelming of the healthcare system, and to optimize utilization of the isolation beds."
5149,Evaluation of two automated low-cost RNA extraction protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection.,"Background: Two automatable in-house protocols for high-troughput RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection have been evaluated. Methods: One hundred forty one SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were collected during a period of 10-days. In-house protocols were based on extraction with magnetic beads and designed to be used with either the Opentrons OT-2 (OT-2in-house) liquid handling robot or the MagMAXTM Express-96 system (MMin-house). Both protocols were tested in parallel with a commercial kit that uses the MagMAXTM system (MMkit). Nucleic acid extraction efficiencies were calculated from a SARS-CoV-2 DNA positive control. Results: No significant differences were found between both in-house protocols and the commercial kit in their performance to detect positive samples. The MMkit was the most efficient although the MMin-house presented, in average, lower Cts than the other two. In-house protocols allowed to save between 350€ and 400€ for every 96 extracted samples compared to the commercial kit. Conclusion: The protocols described harness the use of easily available reagents and an open-source liquid handling system and are suitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection in high throughput facilities."
