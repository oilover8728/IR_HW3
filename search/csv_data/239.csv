2381,Frontline Screening for SARS-CoV-2 Infection at Emergency Department Admission by Third Generation Rapid Antigen Test: Can We Spare RT-qPCR?,"To complement RT-qPCR testing for diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, many countries have introduced the use of rapid antigen tests. As they generally display lower real-life performances than expected, their correct positioning as frontline screening is still controversial. Despite the lack of data from daily clinical use, third generation microfluidic assays (such as the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag test) have recently been suggested to have similar performances to RT-qPCR and have been proposed as alternative diagnostic tools. By analyzing 960 nasopharyngeal swabs from 960 subjects at the emergency department admissions of a tertiary COVID-19 hospital, LumiraDx assay demonstrated a specificity of 97% (95% CI: 96-98), and a sensitivity of 85% (95% CI: 82-89) in comparison with RT-qPCR, which increases to 91% (95% CI: 86-95) for samples with a cycle threshold â‰¤ 29. Fifty false-negative LumiraDx-results were confirmed by direct quantification of genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA through droplet-digital PCR (median (IQR) load = 5880 (1657-41,440) copies/mL). Subgenomic N and E RNAs were detected in 52% (n = 26) and 56% (n = 28) of them, respectively, supporting the presence of active viral replication. Overall, the LumiraDx test complies with the minimum performance requirements of the WHO. Yet, the risk of a misrecognition of patients with active COVID-19 persists, and the need for confirmatory RT-qPCR should not be amended."

2383,Humoral and cellular immunity and the safety of COVID-19 vaccines: a summary of data published by 21 May 2021.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused millions of deaths, and serious consequences to public health, economies and societies. Rapid responses in vaccine development have taken place since the isolation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the release of the viral genome sequence. By 21 May 2021, 101 vaccines were under clinical trials, and published data were available for 18 of them. Clinical study results from some vaccines indicated good immunogenicity and acceptable reactogenicity. Here, we focus on these 18 vaccines that had published clinical data to dissect the induced humoral and cellular immune responses as well as their safety profiles and protection efficacy."

2386,High-speed large-scale automated isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples using miniaturized co-culture coupled to high-content screening.,"Objectives: A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic. Only a few laboratories routinely isolate the virus, which is because the current co-culture strategy is highly time-consuming and requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory. This work aimed to develop a new high-throughput isolation strategy using novel technologies for rapid and automated isolation of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We used an automated microscope based on high-content screening (HCS), and we applied specific image analysis algorithms targeting cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells. A randomized panel of 104 samples, including 72 that tested positive by RT-PCR and 32 that tested negative, were processed with our HCS strategy and were compared with the classical isolation procedure. Results: The isolation rate was 43% (31/72) with both strategies on RT-PCR-positive samples and was correlated with the initial RNA viral load in the samples, in which we obtained a positivity threshold of 27 Ct. Co-culture delays were shorter with the HCS strategy, where 80% (25/31) of the positive samples were recovered by the third day of co-culture, compared with only 26% (8/30) with the classic strategy. Moreover, only the HCS strategy allowed us to recover all the positive samples (31 with HCS versus 27 with classic strategy) after 1 week of co-culture. Conclusions: This system allows the rapid and automated screening of clinical samples with minimal operator workload, which reduces the risk of contamination and paves the way for future applications in clinical microbiology, such as large-scale drug susceptibility testing."
2387,COVID-19 extrapulmonary illness - special gastrointestinal and hepatic considerations.,"Coronaviruses have caused three global outbreaks in the last 20 years, which include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) by MERS-CoV and Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2. These outbreaks share many similarities, including clinical presentation, transmission, and management. Although respiratory manifestations are responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality in these conditions, extra-pulmonary manifestations such as gastrointestinal symptoms are also increasingly recognized as important symptoms. Important gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Hepatic manifestations such as abnormal aminotransferases are also noted in these patients. Early identification of GI symptoms is crucial as some patients can present only with GI manifestations in the absence of pulmonary symptoms. Furthermore, patients with diarrhea have tested positive for viral RNA in the stool. This has been reported even after the resolution of respiratory symptoms and can extend up to many days from the onset of symptoms. Because of this phenomenon, there is a theoretical risk of fecal-oral transmission and the potential spread of the disease. Though GI symptoms are frequently observed, understanding the pathogenesis of these symptoms is crucial, as it can not only of public health importance but could also identify infected patients early in the spread. Understanding the different GI and hepatic manifestations with underlying mechanisms of symptoms can assist in the therapeutic management of these patients. In this article, we summarize various GI and hepatic manifestations with their prevalence, underlying pathophysiology with emphasis on stool positivity."
2388,Epidemiological and evolutionary considerations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dosing regimes.,"Given vaccine dose shortages and logistical challenges, various deployment strategies are being proposed to increase population immunity levels to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two critical issues arise: How timing of delivery of the second dose will affect infection dynamics and how it will affect prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape via a buildup of partially immune individuals. Both hinge on the robustness of the immune response elicited by a single dose as compared with natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but that longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection and find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution under certain conditions of partial population immunity. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose and to ramp up vaccination efforts globally."
