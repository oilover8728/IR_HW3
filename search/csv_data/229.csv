2280,Using Best Practices to Address COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: The Case for the Motivational Interviewing Approach.,"Future control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is dependent on the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Many factors have swayed the public's perception of this coronavirus and the new vaccinations, including misinformation, heightened emotions, and the divisive and tumultuous partisan climate. As such, vaccine hesitancy may be more prevalent for the COVID-19 vaccine than others. Healthcare workers are trusted sources of information and have the opportunity to influence an individual's choice to take the vaccine. For those who initially present as unwilling to be vaccinated, trying to persuade them with facts and scare tactics may cause more resistance. By using the communication approach of motivational interviewing, practitioners can support autonomy to reduce defensiveness, use a guiding style to elicit ambivalence and provide information, address personal agency to ensure that their patients understand that their efforts can reduce risk, and evoke a person's own argument for vaccination to decrease vaccine hesitancy."

2284,The Smell in COVID-19 Infection: Diagnostic Opportunities.,"There is a high prevalence of olfaction changes, especially in the early presentation, in COVID-19 patients. The mechanisms through which the virus leads to anosmia/hyposmia is still not fully understood. However, olfaction changes could be used as an indication for testing or quarantine. Screening for infections and other diseases by recognizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has been previously conducted. Hence, if the coronavirus infection also results in VOCs excretion, physicians could ""smell"" the virus by using electronic noses. We conducted a literature review on olfaction changes and the COVID-19. Our results suggest that these changes could be used an indication for early testing, even as an isolated symptom. We propose that the electronic nose be used as a future screening tool, especially in agglomeration spaces such as airports, for screening for the COVID-19 infection."
2285,A real-life setting evaluation of the effect of remdesivir on viral load in COVID-19 patients admitted to a large tertiary centre in Israel.,"Objectives: The effectiveness of remdesivir, a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been repeatedly questioned during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Most of the recently reported studies were randomized controlled multicentre clinical trials. Our goal was to test the efficiency of remdesivir in reducing nasopharyngeal viral load and hospitalization length in a real-life setting in patients admitted to a large tertiary centre in Israel. Methods: A total of 142 COVID-19 patients found to have at least three reported SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests during hospitalization were selected for this study. Of these, 29 patients received remdesivir, while the remaining non-treated 113 patients served as controls. Results: Among the tested parameters, the control and remdesivir groups differed significantly only in the intubation rates. Remdesivir treatment did not significantly affect nasopharyngeal viral load, as determined by comparing the differences between the first and last cycle threshold values of the SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests performed during hospitalization (cycle threshold 7.07 ± 6.85 vs. 7.08 ± 7.27, p 0.977 in the control and treated groups, respectively). Remdesivir treatment shortened hospitalization length by less than a day compared with non-treated controls and by 3.1 days when non-intubated patients from both groups were compared. These differences, however, were not statistically significant, possibly because of the small size of the remdesivir group. Discussion: Remdesivir was not associated with nasopharyngeal viral load changes, but our study had a significant disease severity baseline imbalance and was not powered to detect viral load or clinical differences."

2288,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 DNA Targets Using Femtoliter Optofluidic Waveguides.,"Chip-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing was demonstrated using silicon nitride (Si3N4) nanoslot fluidic waveguides to detect a tagged oligonucleotide with a coronavirus DNA sequence. The slot waveguides were fabricated using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes, including multiscale lithography and selective reactive ion etching (RIE), forming femtoliter fluidic channels. Finite difference method (FDM) simulation was used to calculate the optical field distribution of the waveguide mode when the waveguide sensor was excited by transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light. For the TE polarization, a strong optical field was created in the slot region and its field intensity was 14× stronger than the evanescent sensing field from the TM polarization. The nanoscale confinement of the optical sensing field significantly enhanced the light-analyte interaction and improved the optical sensitivity. The sensitivity enhancement was experimentally demonstrated by measuring the polarization-dependent fluorescence emission from the tagged oligonucleotide. The photonic chips consisting of femtoliter Si3N4 waveguides provide a low-cost and high throughput platform for real-time virus identification, which is critical for point-of-care (PoC) diagnostic applications."
