2610,"Animals, vaccines, and COVID-19.","Animals, especially mammals, have played a critical role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 virus originated in animals, and the virus can jump back and forth between humans and animals. Moreover, animals have been central to the development of the various vaccines against the virus now employed around the world, continuing a long history. The interrelationships between animals and humans in both disease transmission and its prevention call for an interdisciplinary approach to medicine."
2611,Association of Age With Likelihood of Developing Symptoms and Critical Disease Among Close Contacts Exposed to Patients With Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Italy.,"Importance: Solid estimates of the risk of developing symptoms and of progressing to critical disease in individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are key to interpreting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dynamics, identifying the settings and the segments of the population where transmission is more likely to remain undetected, and defining effective control strategies. Objective: To estimate the association of age with the likelihood of developing symptoms and the association of age with the likelihood of progressing to critical illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study analyzed quarantined case contacts, identified between February 20 and April 16, 2020, in the Lombardy region of Italy. Contacts were monitored daily for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, by either real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs or retrospectively via IgG serological assays. Close contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected as those belonging to clusters (ie, groups of contacts associated with an index case) where all individuals were followed up for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were analyzed from February to June 2020. Exposure: Close contact with individuals with confirmed COVID-19 cases as identified by contact tracing operations. Main outcomes and measures: Age-specific estimates of the risk of developing respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C and of experiencing critical disease (defined as requiring intensive care or resulting in death) in SARS-CoV-2-infected case contacts. Results: In total, 5484 case contacts (median [interquartile range] age, 50 [30-61] years; 3086 female contacts [56.3%]) were analyzed, 2824 of whom (51.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median [interquartile range] age, 53 [34-64] years; 1604 female contacts [56.8%]). The proportion of infected persons who developed symptoms ranged from 18.1% (95% CI, 13.9%-22.9%) among participants younger than 20 years to 64.6% (95% CI, 56.6%-72.0%) for those aged 80 years or older. Most infected contacts (1948 of 2824 individuals [69.0%]) did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C. Only 26.1% (95% CI, 24.1%-28.2%) of infected individuals younger than 60 years developed respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C; among infected participants older than 60 years, 6.6% (95% CI, 5.1%-8.3%) developed critical disease. Female patients were 52.7% (95% CI, 24.4%-70.7%) less likely than male patients to develop critical disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions and relevance: In this Italian cohort study of close contacts of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, more than one-half of individuals tested positive for the virus. However, most infected individuals did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever. The low proportion of children and young adults who developed symptoms highlights the possible challenges in readily identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections."

2613,Positive aspects of the mRNA platform for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.,"The unprecedented need to acquire a safe and effective vaccine for the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global imperative. Researchers have been working urgently and collaboratively to develop vaccines against the causative agent of COVID-19. The use of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine platform offers new opportunities for the development of effective vaccines. The first use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for individuals outside the clinical trials raised concerns over their safety and future efficacy. In social media, particularly in developing countries, widely shared false claims allege that the current mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines potentially integrate into the host genome and thus may genetically modify humans. These vaccines are also assumed to lack efficacy due to the emergence of new strains. Such misinformation cause people to hesitate about receiving vaccination against COVID-19. This commentary aimed to outline the structure, mechanism of action and the major motive for the use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, with a focus on scientifically addressing challenges associated with conspiracy theories and dispelling misinformation around vaccination."
2614,Algorithms for testing COVID-19 focused on use of RT-PCR and high-affinity serological testing: A consensus statement from a panel of Latin American experts.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented public health, social, and economic crisis. Improving understanding on available tests for detecting COVID-19 is critical for effective management of the pandemic. We proposed that a multidisciplinary expert panel can establish recommendations on ideal use of diagnostic tools, with a focus on RT-PCR and serological high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests for the Latin America region. Study design: A collaborative multidisciplinary panel of 5 recognized experts in Latin America (an infectious disease specialist, three pathologists, and an immunologist) was convened and supported by Roche Diagnostics to develop standard guidelines and an evidence-based document of best practices on the use of diagnostic tools for COVID-19. Results: The authors reached consensus on the applicability of diagnostic tools to provide testing algorithms for the use of RT-PCR and serological high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests in three settings: 1) For asymptomatic subjects exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 infected person; 2) For epidemiological purposes and; 3) For symptomatic subjects. Conclusion: The serological high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests play a key role in COVID-19 diagnosis. These tests can be applied for suspected false-negative RT-PCR results and for individual determination of response. The use of these tests can also contribute greatly to public health strategies, such as population screening and supporting vaccination planning. Serological status for high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) should be performed ideally 21 days after potential infectious contact, given that the majority of exposed individuals will have seroconverted."

2618,Crossing the Rubicon: A fine line between waiting and vaccinating adolescents against COVID-19.,"Several countries with advanced adult COVID-19 immunisation programmes have already started vaccinating adolescents with an mRNA vaccine that recently received emergency use authorisation for 12-15 year-olds. The decision to vaccinate adolescents remains highly divisive among parents, clinicians, politicians and policy makers. There are very few downsides to immunising adolescents with a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine because that would significantly reduce their risk of COVID-19 and all its complications. Based on current evidence, however, adolescents have a very low risk of severe or fatal COVID-19, even among those with comorbidities, or rare complications such as long COVID or Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (PIMS-TS), a hyperinflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, currently authorised vaccines are very reactogenic and have limited post-marketing population-level safety data in adolescents and young adults, but these are emerging from countries that have forged ahead with vaccinating adolescents. Countries that have yet to make a recommendation can afford to wait until there is sufficient information to make informed decisions on the risk-benefits of vaccinating adolescents with current and future COVID-19 vaccines. Alternatives to two-dose vaccination in adolescents may include a single dose or a reduced dose schedule as is currently being trialled in younger children."
2619,[WEARING A MASK IS A PERSONAL PROTECTION AGAINST SARS-COV-2 INFECTION EVEN IN A VACCINATION-ON-BOARDING COUNTRY].,"Even with the advent of the COVID-19 vaccine, masks and social distancing are recommended as a precautionary measure to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. In Israel, as in many other countries, despite official regulations and widespread availability and accessibility to affordable effective masks, the use of face masks is not consistent or universal. Physicians and other medical and health professionals have a vital role to play in communicating to the public about the importance of masking and encouraging people to wear face masks correctly and consistently. This review underscores the importance of masking as a protective public health mitigation measure. It describes types of face masks mainly used by the public and their effectiveness. It emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing barriers (e.g., physical, social, economic) to encourage widespread and sustained appropriate use of masks. The article also proposes strategies to enhance masking, such as changing social norms through targeted local interventions and governmental control of mask quality and price."
