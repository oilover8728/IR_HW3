4651,Monte Carlo Simulation of SARS-CoV-2 Radiation-Induced Inactivation for Vaccine Development.,"Immunization with an inactivated virus is one of the strategies currently being tested towards developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. One of the methods used to inactivate viruses is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation to damage their nucleic acids. While gamma (γ) rays effectively induce lesions in the RNA, envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn may alter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce an adaptive immune response able to confer effective protection. Here, we modeled the effect of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on SARS-CoV-2 using the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA. With a realistic 3D target virus model, we calculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins, as well as in the viral RNA. Our findings showed that γ rays produced significant spike protein damage, but densely ionizing charged particles induced less membrane damage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversal through the nuclear envelope was sufficient to inactivate the virus. We propose that accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with little structural damage to envelope proteins, thereby representing a new and effective tool for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses."
4652,COVID-19: Predictions for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on the course of the pandemic and critical occupancy of intensive-care facilities in Germany.,"Aims of the study: To obtain predictions using the Modified Bateman SIZ Model for the effects of vaccination on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Materials and methods: Start parameters for the model were obtained from observational data after data-smoothing to reduce between-day variation. Three scenarios, 1) no vaccination, 2) vaccination of 60% of the population over 12 months, 3) vaccination of 60% of the population over 7 months were examined. The effects of changes in tα (doubling-time for the spread of infection, known to be slower in the summer months) and tβ (half-life of recovery from infection) on the daily number of infectious persons, the cumulative number of infected persons, and the duration of critical occupancy of intensive-care units were also determined. Results: Vaccination produced a marked and rapid reduction in the number of infectious persons (up to -60%) and the total number of infected persons (up to -70%). A 7-month vaccination strategy was significantly more effective than a 12-month strategy. The summer effect came too late to have an additional effect on the spread of infection. Vaccination was predicted to reduce the duration of critical occupancy of intensive-care facilities by ~ 70%. Discussion: The predictions are based on the assumptions that lockdown conditions are maintained and vaccine availability is not limiting. Conclusion: Predictions made using the model show that vaccination with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can markedly reduce the spread of the COVID-19 disease and the period of critical occupancy of intensive-care facilities in Germany."
4653,A comparative online survey on the intention to get COVID-19 vaccine between Greek and Cypriot healthcare personnel: is the country a predictor?,"Vaccine hesitancy amongst healthcare personnel (HCP) is a critical issue. The aim was to explore the factors that determine the intention to opt for COVID-19 vaccine among HCP from two southern European countries. An anonymous online self-administered survey using Google Forms has been conducted between December 1st to December 15th, 2020 among the HCP in Greece and the Republic of Cyprus. A total of 2,238 HCPs participated in the study (1,220/54.5% from Republic of Cyprus and 1,018 from Greece). Overall 1,082 (48.3%) stressed their intention to get vaccinated (64.4% for Greece and 34.9% for Republic of Cyprus). The main reasons for those who intend to get the COVID-19 vaccine include self (94.2%), family (98.7%), and patients protection (95.2%) as well as mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic (95.4%). The multivariate logistic regression that was performed for the total sample revealed that the following variables were significantly associated with an increased probability to get vaccinated against COVID-19: being a physician, a member of the nursing personnel, paramedical staff, working in Greece, age, the belief that influenza vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and the rating of the overall management of COVID-19 pandemic in the country and from the public hospitals. Physicians were more likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19 than other HCP. The age was a predictor of COVID-19 uptake intention in the Republic of Cyprus. The belief that there was a successful management of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the intention to COVID-19 vaccination uptake."
4654,Development of multiplexed reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viral RNA.,"The ongoing pandemic has demonstrated the utility of widespread surveillance and diagnostic detection of the novel SARS-CoV-2. Reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has enabled broader testing, but current LAMP tests only detect single targets and require separate reactions for controls. With flu season in the Northern Hemisphere, the ability to screen for multiple targets will be increasingly important, and the ability to include internal controls in RT-LAMP allows for improved efficiency. Here we describe multiplexed RT-LAMP with four targets (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, human RNA) in a single reaction using real-time and end point fluorescence detection. Such increased functionality of RT-LAMP will enable even broader adoption of this molecular testing approach and aid in the fight against this public health threat."
4655,Rapid Differential Diagnosis of Seven Human Respiratory Coronaviruses Based on Centrifugal Microfluidic Nucleic Acid Assay.,"With the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the highly infective, highly pathogenic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has attracted great attention. Currently, a method to simultaneously diagnose the seven known types human coronaviruses remains lacking and is urgently needed. In this work, we successfully developed a portable microfluidic system for the rapid, accurate, and simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, and four other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. The disk-like microfluidic platform integrated with loop-mediated isothermal amplification provides highly accurate, sensitive, and specific results with a wide linear range within 40 min. The diagnostic tool achieved 100% consistency with the ""gold standard"" polymerase chain reaction in detecting 54 real clinical samples. The integrated system, with its simplicity, is urgently needed for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic."

4657,Prevalence of COVID-19 Mimics in the Emergency Department.,"Objective Due to the lack of specific clinical manifestations and symptoms, it is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 from mimics. A common pitfall is to rush to make a diagnosis when encountering a patient with COVID-19-like symptoms. The present study describes a series of COVID-19 mimics using an outpatient database collected from a designated COVID-19 healthcare facility in Tokyo, Japan. Methods We established an emergency room (ER) tailored specifically for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 called the ""COVID-ER."" In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we enrolled patients who visited the COVID-ER from February 1 to September 5, 2020. The outcomes included the prevalence of COVID-19, admission, potentially fatal diseases and final diagnosis. Results We identified 2,555 eligible patients. The median age was 38 (interquartile range, 26-57) years old. During the study period, the prevalence of COVID-19 was 17.9% (457/2,555). Non-COVID-19 diagnoses accounted for 82.1% of all cases. The common cold had the highest prevalence and accounted for 33.0% of all final diagnoses, followed by gastroenteritis (9.4%), urinary tract infections (3.8%), tonsillitis (2.9%), heat stroke (2.6%) and bacterial pneumonia (2.1%). The prevalence of potentially fatal diseases was 14.2% (298/2,098) among non-COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Several potentially fatal diseases remain masked among the wave of COVID-19 mimics. It is imperative that a thorough differential diagnostic panel be considered prior to the rendering of a COVID-19 diagnosis."

4659,Pulling-Force Spinning Top for Serum Separation Combined with Paper-Based Microfluidic Devices in COVID-19 ELISA Diagnosis.,"The spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in a global pandemic with around four million deaths. Although there are a variety of nucleic acid-based tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2, these methods have a relatively high cost and require expensive supporting equipment. To overcome these limitations and improve the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, we developed a microfluidic platform that collected serum by a pulling-force spinning top and paper-based microfluidic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantitative IgA/IgM/IgG measurements in an instrument-free way. We further validated the paper-based microfluidic ELISA analysis of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA/IgM/IgG antibodies from human blood samples as a good measurement with higher sensitivity compared with traditional IgM/IgG detection (99.7% vs 95.6%) for early illness onset patients. In conclusion, we provide an alternative solution for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in a portable manner by this smart integration of pulling-force spinning top and paper-based microfluidic immunoassay."
