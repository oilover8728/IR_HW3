3640,"Adults Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-United States, March-June and October-December 2020: Implications for the Potential Effects of COVID-19 Tier-1 Vaccination on Future Hospitalizations and Outcomes.","Background: Because of the increased risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) initially prioritized COVID-19 vaccination for persons in long-term care facilities (LTCF), persons aged ≥65 years, and persons aged 16-64 years with high-risk medical conditions when there is limited vaccine supply. We compared characteristics and severe outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States between early and later in the pandemic categorized by groups at higher risk of severe COVID-19. Methods: Observational study of sampled patients aged ≥18 years who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and admitted to one of 14 academic hospitals in the United States during March-June and October-December 2020. Demographic and clinical information were gathered from electronic health record data. Results: Among 647 patients, 91% met ≥1 of the following risk factors for severe COVID-19 [91% March-June (n = 434); 90% October-December (n = 213)]; 19% were LTCF residents, 45% were aged ≥65-years, and 84% had ≥1 high-risk condition. The proportion of patients who resided in a LTCF declined significantly (25% vs 6%) from early to later pandemic periods. Compared with patients at lower risk for severe COVID-19, in-hospital mortality was higher among patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 (20% vs 7%); these differences were consistently observed between March-June and October-December. Conclusions: Most adults hospitalized with COVID-19 were those recommended to be prioritized for vaccination based on risk for developing severe COVID-19. These findings highlight the continued urgency to vaccinate patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 and monitor vaccination impact on hospitalizations and outcomes."

3643,"COVID-19 and Dentistry: Biological Considerations, Testing Strategies, Issues, and Regulations.","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new and demanding work environment for health professionals. This article will focus on the biological issues related to infection and disease, tests developed based on these biological principles, the ways in which these tests are evaluated, and how they can be used to protect both patients, dental professionals, and office affiliates. The article will describe types of COVID-19 testing that may be performed in dental offices, the issue of testing and anxiety, regulations regarding testing that are relevant to dentists, rules for delivery and reimbursement, and strategies for proceeding as a health professional in the current challenging environment. The authors conclude that the devastating effects of the pandemic on public health has facilitated a new role for dentists as public health professionals, with the opportunity for the dental profession to actively expand its participation in improving the health of the public moving forward. Testing will continue as a means of relieving anxiety for the public."

3645,Adverse events following mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among U.S. nursing home residents.,"Background: The devastating impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic prompted the development and emergency use authorization of two mRNA vaccines in early 2020. Vaccine trials excluded nursing home (NH) residents, limiting adverse event data that directly apply to this population. Methods: To prospectively monitor for potential adverse events associated with vaccination, we used Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from Genesis HealthCare, the largest NH provider in the United States. EHR data on vaccinations and pre-specified adverse events were updated daily and monitored for signal detection among residents of 147 facilities who received the first dose of vaccine between December 18, 2020 and January 3, 2021. For comparison, unvaccinated residents during the same time period were included from 137 facilities that started vaccinating at least 15 days after the vaccinating-facilities. Results: As of January 3, 2021, 8553 NH residents had received one dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and by February 20, 2021, 8371 residents had received their second dose of vaccine; 11,072 were included in the unvaccinated comparator group. No significant associations were noted for neurologic outcomes, anaphylaxis, or cardiac events. Conclusions: No major safety problems were detected following the first or second dose of the vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in the study cohort from December 18, 2020 through March 7, 2021."
3646,Multi-center evaluation of cepheid xpert xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,"Background: With the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, rapid diagnostics are paramount to contain the current pandemic. The routinely used realtime RT-PCR is sensitive, specific and able to process large batches of samples. However, turnaround time is long and in cases where fast obtained results are critical, molecular point of care tests (POCT) can be an alternative. Here we report on a multicenter evaluation of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test. Study design: The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated against the routine in-house real-time RT-PCR assays in three medical microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands. A sensitivity and specificity panel was tested consisting of a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and ten samples containing SARS-CoV-2 and a range of other seasonal respiratory viruses. Additionally, 58 samples of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with different viral loads and 30 tested negative samples in all three Dutch laboratories using an in-house RT-PCR, were evaluated using Cepheids Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges. Results: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point of care test showed equal performance compared to routine in-house testing with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.26 copies/mL. Other seasonal respiratory viruses were not detected. In clinical samples Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reaches an agreement of 100 % compared to all in-house RT-PCRs CONCLUSION: Cepheids GeneXpert Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable addition for laboratories in situations where rapid and accurate diagnostics are of the essence."
3647,Beyond neutralization for BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination.,"Mounting a robust immune response against SARS-CoV-2 requires neutralization as well as effector T cell functions. In this issue of Cell Host Microbe, Tauzin et al. characterize the humoral and T cell responses after a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in individuals with or without previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2."
3648,Rural community pharmacies' preparedness for and responses to COVID-19.,"Background: Few studies have documented rural community pharmacy disaster preparedness. Objectives: To: (1) describe rural community pharmacies' preparedness for and responses to COVID-19 and (2) examine whether responses vary by level of pharmacy rurality. Methods: A convenience sample of rural community pharmacists completed an online survey (62% response rate) that assessed: (a) demographic characteristics; (b) COVID-19 information source use; (c) interest in COVID-19 testing; (d) infection control procedures; (e) disaster preparedness training, and (f) medication supply impacts. Descriptive statistics were calculated and differences by pharmacy rurality were explored. Results: Pharmacists used the CDC (87%), state health departments (77%), and state pharmacy associations (71%) for COVID-19 information, with half receiving conflicting information. Most pharmacists (78%) were interested in offering COVID-19 testing but needed personal protective equipment and training to do so. Only 10% had received disaster preparedness training in the past five years. Although 73% had disaster preparedness plans, 27% were deemed inadequate for the pandemic. Nearly 70% experienced negative impacts in medication supply. There were few differences by rurality level. Conclusion: Rural pharmacies may be better positioned to respond to pandemics if they had disaster preparedness training, updated disaster preparedness plans, and received regular policy guidance from professional bodies."
