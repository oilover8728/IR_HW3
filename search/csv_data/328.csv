3272,Minute-scale detection of SARS-CoV-2 using a low-cost biosensor composed of pencil graphite electrodes.,"COVID-19 has led to over 3.47 million deaths worldwide and continues to devastate primarily middle- and low-income countries. High-frequency testing has been proposed as a potential solution to prevent outbreaks. However, current tests are not sufficiently low-cost, rapid, or scalable to enable broad COVID-19 testing. Here, we describe LEAD (Low-cost Electrochemical Advanced Diagnostic), a diagnostic test that detects severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within 6.5 min and costs $1.50 per unit to produce using easily accessible and commercially available materials. LEAD is highly sensitive toward SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (limit of detection = 229 fg⋅mL-1) and displays an excellent performance profile using clinical saliva (100.0% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity, and 100.0% accuracy) and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (88.7% sensitivity, 86.0% specificity, and 87.4% accuracy) samples. No cross-reactivity was detected with other coronavirus or influenza strains. Importantly, LEAD also successfully diagnosed the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 UK variant. The device presents high reproducibility under all conditions tested and preserves its original sensitivity for 5 d when stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline. Our low-cost and do-it-yourself technology opens new avenues to facilitate high-frequency testing and access to much-needed diagnostic tests in resource-limited settings and low-income communities."
3273,The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient clinics and public facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can occur through an airborne route, in addition to contaminated surfaces and objects. In hospitals, it has been confirmed by several studies that SARS-CoV-2 can contaminate surfaces and medical equipment especially in hospitals dedicated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The aim of this study was to detect the contamination of hands, objects, and surfaces in isolation rooms and also in outpatients' clinics in hospitals and polyclinics. Environmental contamination of public high-touch surfaces in public facilities was also investigated during an active COVID-19 pandemic. Random swabs were also taken from public shops, pharmacies, bakeries, groceries, banknotes, and automated teller machines (ATMs). Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 positivity using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the COVID-19 regional reference hospital, only 3 out of 20 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Hand swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in isolation rooms were occasionally positive for viral RNA. In outpatients' clinics, door handles were the most contaminated surfaces. Dental chairs, sinks, keyboards, ophthalmoscopes, and laboratory equipment were also contaminated. Although no positive swabs were found in shops and public facilities, random ATM swabs returned a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Although there is no longer a focus on COVID-19 wards and isolation hospitals, more attention is required to decontaminate frequently touched surfaces in health-care facilities used by patients not diagnosed with COVID-19. Additionally, high-touch public surfaces such as ATMs require further disinfection procedures to limit the transmission of the infection."

3277,Geriatrics and COVID-19.,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has begun to infect people. The virus first occurred in Wuhan, China, but the whole world is now struggling with the pandemic. Over 13 million confirmed cases and 571,000 deaths have been reported so far, and this number is growing. Older people, who constitute a notable proportion of the world population, are at an increased risk of infection because of altered immunity and chronic comorbidities. Thus, appropriate health care is necessary to control fatalities and spread of the disease in this specific population. The chapter provides an overview of diagnostic methods, laboratory and imaging findings, clinical features, and management of COVID-19 in aged people. Possible mechanisms behind the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly include immunosenescence and related impaired antiviral immunity, mature immunity and related hyper-inflammatory responses, comorbidities and their effects on the functioning of critical organs/systems, and the altered expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that acts as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. This evidence defines the herding behavior of COVID-19 in relation to ACE2 under the influence of immune dysregulation. Then, identifying the immunogenetic factors that affect the disease susceptibility and severity and as well as key inflammatory pathways that have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets needs to remain an active area of research."

3279,Assessing the Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines: A Primer.,"Vaccines against COVID-19 are being developed at speeds not previously achieved. With this unprecedented effort comes challenges for post-marketing safety monitoring and challenges for vaccine safety communication. To deploy these new vaccines fast across diverse populations, it is vital that robust pharmacovigilance and active surveillance systems are in place. Not all countries have the capability or resources to undertake adequate surveillance and will rely on data from those who can. The tools exist to assess COVID-19 vaccines as they are deployed such as surveillance systems, administrative data and case definitions for adverse events of special interest. However, stitching these all together and using them effectively requires investment and collaboration. This paper provides a high-level overview of some of the facets of modern vaccine safety assessment and how they are, or can be, applied to COVID-19 vaccines."
