Within 12 months since the RNA sequence of SARS-COV2 has been published already two RNA vaccines against COVID-19 have been licensed and are broadly used in many relevant parts of the world. Matching the challenge of an unprecedented global pandemic unique collaborative approaches have made available several vaccines based on a variety of technological platforms that are under current development. This article explains the characteristics, biology and pharmacology of subunit-vaccines, inactivated and attenuated vaccines, Virus-like-Particle vaccines, recombinant strategies based on adenoviral vectors and newly developed and first time in human licensed RNA-vaccines that came into scope recently. Allergic reactions against the vaccine and its components have been reported but are yet uncommon, however need good documentation such as other side-effects and immune-phenomena. In rare cases where allergy against vaccine components such as PEGs is considered, such PEGs can be tested using a skin-prick test. Development of innovative vaccine technology and antiviral medication is of strategic relevance in the best sense of ""pandemic preparedness"" for the future."
4581,COVID-19 vaccines in multiple sclerosis treated with cladribine or ocrelizumab.,"Since the recent approval of vaccines against COVID-19, efficacy concerns emerged for MS patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. We report our experience in four patients, under cladribine (two) or under ocrelizumab (two) treatment, all with low lymphocyte count, three of them vaccinated after 3 months from the last dose with good immune response, one (under ocrelizumab) after 2 months, without developing an appropriate title of antibodies. This experience suggests that the discriminant for the response to the vaccine is not the lymphocyte count but the timing of the vaccination."
4582,Broad cross-national public support for accelerated COVID-19 vaccine trial designs.,"A vaccine for COVID-19 is urgently needed. Several vaccine trial designs may significantly accelerate vaccine testing and approval, but also increase risks to human subjects. Concerns about whether the public would see such designs as ethical represent an important roadblock to their implementation; accordingly, both the World Health Organization and numerous scholars have called for consulting the public regarding them. We answered these calls by conducting a cross-national survey (n = 5920) in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The survey explained key differences between traditional vaccine trials and two accelerated designs: a challenge trial or a trial integrating a Phase II safety and immunogenicity trial into a larger Phase III efficacy trial. Respondents' answers to comprehension questions indicate that they largely understood the key differences and ethical trade-offs between the designs from our descriptions. We asked respondents whether they would prefer scientists to conduct traditional trials or one of these two accelerated designs. We found broad majorities prefer for scientists to conduct challenge trials (75%) and integrated trials (63%) over standard trials. Even as respondents acknowledged the risks, they perceived both accelerated trials as similarly ethical to standard trial designs. This high support is consistent across every geography and demographic subgroup we examined, including vulnerable populations. These findings may help assuage some of the concerns surrounding accelerated designs."
4583,CLINICAL AND LABORATORY CHARACTERISTICS OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS.,"Objective: To present the current evidence on clinical and laboratory characteristics of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during childhood and adolescence. Data source: This is a narrative review conducted in the databases: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE/PubMed), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature in the Virtual Health Library (LILACS/VHL), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, portal of the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - CAPES), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), ScienceDirect, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). The terms used were SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, novel coronavirus, child, newborn, and adolescent. Data synthesis: Unlike adults, most children infected by SARS-CoV-2 have mild or asymptomatic clinical presentations. Symptomatic children mainly have low fever and cough, with some associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Severe cases are rare and occur especially in infants under one year of age. Detection of viral particles in feces seems to be more persistent in children and can be used as a tool for diagnosis and control of the quarantine period. Different from adults, children can present distinct inflammatory responses, as has happened in new cases of Kawasaki-like syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Most children have asymptomatic or mild presentations, with a prevalence of fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms. New cases with different systemic inflammatory reactions in children have been reported, with clinical manifestations distinct from those typically found in adults."

4585,Liposome-mediated detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive extracellular vesicles in plasma.,"Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA may represent a viable diagnostic alternative to respiratory RNA levels, which rapidly decline after infection. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) reference assays exhibit poor performance with plasma, probably reflecting the dilution and degradation of viral RNA released into the circulation, but these issues could be addressed by analysing viral RNA packaged into extracellular vesicles. Here we describe an assay approach in which extracellular vesicles directly captured from plasma are fused with reagent-loaded liposomes to sensitively amplify and detect a SARS-CoV-2 gene target. This approach accurately identified patients with COVID-19, including challenging cases missed by RT-qPCR. SARS-CoV-2-positive extracellular vesicles were detected at day 1 post-infection, and plateaued from day 6 to the day 28 endpoint in a non-human primate model, while signal durations for 20-60 days were observed in young children. This nanotechnology approach uses a non-infectious sample and extends virus detection windows, offering a tool to support COVID-19 diagnosis in patients without SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectable in the respiratory tract."
4586,Best practices for correctly identifying coronavirus by transmission electron microscopy.,"This guidance provides clear, concise strategies for identifying coronaviruses by transmission electron microscopy of ultrathin sections of tissues or infected tissue cultures. These include a description of virus morphology as well as cell organelles that can resemble viruses. Biochemical testing and caveats are discussed. Numerous references provide information for documentation and further study."
4587,SARS-CoV-2 impact on oral health: A general view.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. China reported the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019, and a few months later, the World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic. Oral ulcers in adult patients have been associated with COVID-19. However, no cases have yet been documented in children. The angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor has been identified in tissues of the oral cavity. Studies have identified the tongue as the site with the highest expression of ACE2, and the oral epithelium, gingival epithelium, and salivary glands as sites of lesser extent expression. ACE2 expression is lower in children and varies with age. SARS-CoV-2 in saliva has been identified in various studies, which suggests that this could be a useful sample for diagnosis. However, its presence in saliva would indicate the high risk of contagion of this fluid."
4588,Analysis of cycle threshold values in SARS-CoV-2-PCR in a long-term study.,"Background: Cycle threshold (Ct) values can be used in an attempt to semiquantify results in the qualitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The significance of Ct values in epidemiological studies and large cohorts is still unclear. Objective: To monitor Ct values in a long-term study and compare the results with demographic data of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. Study design: S gene SARS-CoV-2 Ct values were analyzed retrospectively from consecutive patients between March 15th to September 15th 2020 with special regard to age, gender, and in- or outpatient status. Results: In total, 65,878 patients were tested, 1103 (1.7 %) of whom were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-six positive patients were excluded, because the respective PCR runs did not meet the stability requirements (Ct value of the positive controls between 26 and 29). Of the remaining 1077 patients, females (n = 566; 53 %) were significantly older than males (n = 511; 47 %) (50.9 versus 45.1 years; p = 0.006) and had slightly higher mean Ct values than males (25.4 vs. 24.8; p = 0.04). Patients in the age groups >80 years had significantly higher Ct values than the remaining age groups (p < 0.001). Children (0-19 years) showed Ct values in the range of those found in adults (25.2 vs. 25.1, p = 0.9). There were no statistically different Ct values between in- and outpatients (p = 0.1), however, SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients were significantly older than outpatients (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: CT values are suitable for more detailed monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Age is an important cofactor in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and may have influence on Ct values in SARS-CoV-2-PCR."
4589,"Covid-19, the WHO, and the apparent collapse of traditional medical research ethics.","On January 14, 2021, a WHO Ad Hoc expert group published an article in the highly influential The New England Journal of Medicine, titled: ""Placebo-Controlled Trials of Covid-19 Vaccines - Why We Still Need Them"" justifying the use of placebo in further trials of Covid-19 vaccines, even after purported efficacious vaccines have become available. Medical research involving human beings ought to conform strictly to principles, rules and procedures established since the Nuremberg Code (1947), especially as elaborated in the Declaration of Helsinki (2013) and the WHO/CIOMS Guidelines (2016). The NEJM article forms part of an observable trend of moral backsliding that needs to be recorded. In this paper, considering traditional medical research ethics under the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its ramifications and effects, and with a particular focus on the highly vulnerable populations and countries of sub-Saharan Africa, I make some relevant remarks. My arguments here are anchored in my observations as a moral philosopher though limited by my lack of expertise in any of the branches of medical science."
