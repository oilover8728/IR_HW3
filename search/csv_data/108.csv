1070,A detailed review of the outbreak of COVID-19.,"The disease COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly infectious human Coronavirus epidemic in the 21s⁢t century due to its high transmission rate and quick evolution of its pathogenicity. Genomic studies indicate that it is zoonotic from bats. The COVID-19 has led to significant loss of lives and a tremendous economic decline in the world. Generally, the population at risk of a fatal outcome are the elderly and those who are debilitated or are immune compromised. The fatality rate is high, but now is reduced after the development of preventive vaccine although an effective treatment by drug against the virus is yet to be developed. The treatment is narrowed to the use of several anti-viral drugs, or other re-purposed drugs. Social distancing, therefore, has emerged as a putative method to decrease the rate of infection. In this review, we summarize the aspects of the disease that is so far have come to light and review the impact of the infection on our society, healthcare, economy, education, and environment."
1071,"Field-deployable, rapid diagnostic testing of saliva for SARS-CoV-2.","To safely re-open economies and prevent future outbreaks, rapid, frequent, point-of-need, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is necessary. However, existing field-deployable COVID-19 testing methods require the use of uncomfortable swabs and trained providers in PPE, while saliva-based methods must be transported to high complexity laboratories for testing. Here, we report the development and clinical validation of High-Performance Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (HP-LAMP), a rapid, saliva-based, SARS-CoV-2 test with a limit of detection of 1.4 copies of virus per µl of saliva and a sensitivity and specificity with clinical samples of > 96%, on par with traditional RT-PCR based methods using swabs, but can deliver results using only a single fluid transfer step and simple heat block. Testing of 120 patient samples in 40 pools comprised of 5 patient samples each with either all negative or a single positive patient sample was 100% accurate. Thus, HP-LAMP may enable rapid and accurate results in the field using saliva, without need of a high-complexity laboratory."
1072,Could flank pain be an indicator of COVID-19 infection?,"Background: We describe the incidental detection of patients infiltrates due to COVID-19 in lung basal sections in patients undergoing abdominal computed tomography (CT) with flank pain attending the urology outpatient clinic during the current pandemic. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 276 patients admitted to the Siirt Training and Research Hospital Urology outpatients clinic between 15 March 2020 and 9 August 2020 with a complaint of flank pain and undergoing non-contrast abdominal CT. A total of 10 patients with COVID-19 compatible findings in CT were defined as the study group. A control group was formed from 10 patients with only urological pathologies (kidney stones, ureteral stones, and hydronephrosis) without a COVID-19 compatible appearance on CT. Results: Ten (3.6 %) patients were identified with COVID-19 and pneumonic infiltrations in the basal regions of the lungs; diagnosis was made by cross-sectional abdominal CT. The visual analog scale (VAS) score of flank pain was significantly higher in the control group (p<0.001); these subjects had urological pathology and no evidence of COVID-19 in the basal regions of the lungs on abdominal CT. There were no signs of COVID-19 disease detected during the admissions procedure in the urology outpatient clinic, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider a diagnosis of COVID_19 in patients reporting non-severe flank pain if no urological pathology is evident on abdominal CT scans."
1073,"New challenges to fighting COVID-19: Virus variants, potential vaccines, and development of antivirals.","Despite strict control measures implemented worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage. Several drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, and remdesivir, have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 during the past year. While most of the drugs failed to display efficacy in treating COVID-19, scientists have encouraged herd immunity to control the pandemic. Immunity generated after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 is precarious, as indicated by real-world evidence in the form of epidemiological data from Manaus, Brazil. Vaccines using different platforms are therefore the most promising approach to help us return to normality. Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, there are still many concerns regarding their accessibility, the vaccination rate, and most importantly, their efficacy in preventing infection with emerging virus variants. Continued virus surveillance and rapid redesign of new vaccines to counter new variants are crucial to fighting COVID-19. Rapid production and extensive vaccination are also essential to preventing the emergence of new variants. Nevertheless, antivirals including monoclonal antibodies and oral medicines need to be developed in light of uncertainties with regard to vaccination. In the battle between humans and SARS-CoV-2, the speed with which we fight the virus, and especially its emerging variants, is the key to winning."
1074,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM improves clinical sensitivity early in disease course.,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is diagnosed by molecular-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Serologic testing detects antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and IgM specifically may serve as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease. We evaluated the Abbott anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays along with DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total. Methods: Specimens from 175 PCR-positive patients and 107 control specimens were analyzed using Abbott IgM and IgG, DiaSorin IgG, and Roche Total (IgA, IgG, IgM) assays. Sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, concordance between assays, trends over time, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. Results: Abbott IgM sensitivity was 63.6% at 0 days post-PCR positivity, 76.5% at 1-5d, 76.3% at 6-14d, 85.2% at 15-30d, and 63.6% at > 30d. All assays exhibited highest sensitivity 15-30d post-PCR positivity (83.3-85.2%). Combining Abbott IgM and IgG improved sensitivity by 22.7% compared to IgG alone when tested 0d post-PCR positivity. All assays had a specificity of 100% and only Abbott IgG exhibited cross-reactivity (anti-dsDNA). Cohen's kappa varied between 0.86 and 0.93. Time to seroconversion from PCR positivity was lowest for Abbott IgM and highest for Abbott IgG. NPV was highest for Abbott IgM < 14 days post-PCR positivity and Abbott IgG ≥ 14 days. Conclusion: The Abbott IgM assay exhibited the earliest response and greatest signal in most patients evaluated for serial sampling and had the highest NPV < 14 days post-PCR positivity, suggesting its potential utility as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease course."
1075,Open-source RNA extraction and RT-qPCR methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection.,"Re-opening of communities in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has ignited new waves of infections in many places around the world. Mitigating the risk of reopening will require widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would be greatly facilitated by simple, rapid, and inexpensive testing methods. This study evaluates several protocols for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR that are simpler and less expensive than prevailing methods. First, isopropanol precipitation is shown to provide an effective means of RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. Second, direct addition of NP swab samples to RT-qPCRs is evaluated without an RNA extraction step. A simple, inexpensive swab collection solution suitable for direct addition is validated using contrived swab samples. Third, an open-source master mix for RT-qPCR is described that permits detection of viral RNA in NP swab samples with a limit of detection of approximately 50 RNA copies per reaction. Quantification cycle (Cq) values for purified RNA from 30 known positive clinical samples showed a strong correlation (r2 = 0.98) between this homemade master mix and commercial TaqPath master mix. Lastly, end-point fluorescence imaging is found to provide an accurate diagnostic readout without requiring a qPCR thermocycler. Adoption of these simple, open-source methods has the potential to reduce the time and expense of COVID-19 testing."
1076,"An overview of SARS-COV-2 epidemiology, mutant variants, vaccines, and management strategies.","Background: Over the last two decades, humanity has observed the extraordinary anomaly caused by novel, weird coronavirus strains, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has made its entry into the world, it has dramatically affected life in every domain by continuously producing new variants. The vaccine development is an ongoing process, although some vaccines got marketed. The big challenge is now whether the vaccine candidates can provide long-lasting protection or prevention against mutant variants. Methods: The information was gathered from various journals, electronic searches via Internet-based information such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, online electronic journals, WHO landscape, world meters, WHO website, and News. Results: This review will present and discuss some coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) related aspects including: the pathophysiology, epidemiology, mutant variants vaccine candidates, vaccine efficacy, and management strategies. Due to the high death rate, continuous spread, an inadequate workforce, lack of required therapeutics, and incomplete understanding of the viral strain, it becomes crucial to build the knowledge of its biological characteristics and make available the rapid diagnostic and vital therapeutic machinery for the combat and management of an infection. Conclusion: The data summarizes current research on the COVID 19 infection and therapeutic interventions, which will direct future decision-making on the effort-worthy phases of the COVID 19 and the development of critical therapeutics. The only possible solution is the vaccine development targeting against all variant strains to halt its progress; the identified theoretical and practical knowledge can eliminate the gaps to improve a better understanding of the novel coronavirus structure and its design of a vaccine. In addition, to that the long-lasting protection is another challenging objective that need to be looked into."
1077,Frontrunners in the race to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.,"Numerous studies continue to be published on the COVID-19 pandemic that is being caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Given the rapidly evolving global response to SARS-CoV-2, here we primarily review the leading COVID-19 vaccine strategies that are currently in Phase III clinical trials. Nonreplicating viral vector strategies, inactivated virus, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccine platforms are all being pursued in an effort to combat the infection. Preclinical and clinal trial results of these efforts are examined as well as the characteristics of each vaccine strategy from the humoral and cellular immune responses they stimulate, effects of any adjuvants used, and the potential risks associated with immunization such as antibody-dependent enhancement. A number of promising advancements have been made toward the development of multiple vaccine candidates. Preliminary data now emerging from phase III clinical trials show encouraging results for the protective efficacy and safety of at least 3 frontrunning candidates. There is hope that one or more will emerge as potent weapons to protect against SARS-CoV-2."
1078,Usefulness of a multiplex immunodot in case of discordant results between automated COVID-19 serological assays.,"Background: At present, the only reliable test for COVID-19 diagnosis is RT-qPCR. Serological assays have been widely used to increase the detection sensitivity of infected population. Hereby, we report the performance of a new pan-IgG multiplex Enzyme Immunoassay (immunodot) method for exploration of discrepant SARS-COV-2 serological results. Methods: A retrospective study on 38 residual serum samples from recovered COVID-19 subjects with discordant serological results on Roche and Snibe platforms, were reanalyzed on a new semi-automated pan-IgG immunodot Enzyme Immunoassay, namely COVIDOT-TEST, in order to find the source of discrepancies and to evaluate the latter method. All samples were analyzed on the BlueDiver® Instrument and all strips were read by the BlueScan® Scanner using Dr DOT® Software. Results: Based on our data, subject samples showed specific IgG reactions on ≥ 2 different antigens on immunodot strips. Of these 38 samples, 97.4 % of samples showed specific IgG reaction against S1 + S2 antigens, 89.5 % showed against RBD antigen, 86.8 % against S2 antigen reaction on the COVIDOT-TEST kit. Specific IgG-S1 antigen and IgG-N antigen reactions were detected in 73.7 % and 65.8 % of the samples, respectively. Conclusion: The new semi-automated pan-IgG immunodot Enzyme Immunoassay method appeared to be a reliable assay to confirm suspicious COVID-19 serological screening results."
1079,The Laboratory Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019- Frequently Asked Questions.,"Diagnostic testing has played and will continue to play a major role in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The ability to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory secretions is essential to determine when an individual is infected and potentially infectious to others. Viral detection is used for the identification, management, and isolation of individual patients. Viral detection is also used to determine when the virus has entered a community and how rapidly it is spreading. As communities attempt to reopen following periods of shutdown, the detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and specific antibodies that recognize the virus will become increasingly important as a means to assess infection and immunity in individuals and communities. Here, we discuss questions commonly asked by clinicians about COVID-19 diagnostic testing."
