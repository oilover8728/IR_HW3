5150,Potential impact of introducing vaccines against COVID-19 under supply and uptake constraints in France: A modelling study.,"Background: The accelerated vaccine development in response to the COVID-19 pandemic should lead to a vaccine being available early 2021, albeit in limited supply and possibly without full vaccine acceptance. We assessed the short-term impact of a COVID-19 immunization program with varying constraints on population health and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) needs. Methods: A SARS-CoV-2 transmission model was calibrated to French epidemiological data. We defined several vaccine implementation scenarios starting in January 2021 based on timing of discontinuation of NPIs, supply and uptake constraints, and their relaxation. We assessed the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations averted, the need for and number of days with NPIs in place over the 2021-2022 period. Results: An immunisation program under constraints could reduce the burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 9-40% if the vaccine prevents against infections. Relaxation of constraints not only reduces further COVID-19 hospitalizations (30-39% incremental reduction), it also allows for NPIs to be discontinued post-2021 (0 days with NPIs in 2022 versus 11 to 125 days for vaccination programs under constraints and 327 in the absence of vaccination). Conclusion: For 2021, COVID-19 control is expected to rely on a combination of NPIs and the outcome of early immunisation programs. The ability to overcome supply and uptake constraints will help prevent the need for further NPIs post-2021. As the programs expand, efficiency assessments will be needed to ensure optimisation of control policies post-emergency use."
5151,"Lessons from applied large-scale pooling of 133,816 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests.","Pooling multiple swab samples before RNA extraction and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis has been proposed as a strategy to reduce costs and increase throughput of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests. However, reports on practical large-scale group testing for SARS-CoV-2 have been scant. Key open questions concern reduced sensitivity due to sample dilution, the rate of false positives, the actual efficiency (number of tests saved by pooling), and the impact of infection rate in the population on assay performance. Here, we report an analysis of 133,816 samples collected between April and September 2020 and tested by Dorfman pooling for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We spared 76% of RNA extraction and RT-PCR tests, despite the frequently changing prevalence (0.5 to 6%). We observed pooling efficiency and sensitivity that exceeded theoretical predictions, which resulted from the nonrandom distribution of positive samples in pools. Overall, our findings support the use of pooling for efficient large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing."

5153,"Short-term impact of nursing home SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations on new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.","Objective: To compare rates of incident SARS-CoV-2 infection and 30-day hospitalization or death among residents with confirmed infection in nursing homes with earlier versus later SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinics. Design: Matched pairs analysis of nursing homes that had their initial vaccine clinics between December 18, 2020, and January 2, 2021, versus between January 3, 2021, and January 18, 2021. Matched facilities had their initial vaccine clinics between 12 and 16 days apart. Setting and participants: Two hundred and eighty nursing homes in 21 states owned and operated by the largest long-term care provider in the United States. Measurements: Incident SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 at-risk residents per week; hospital transfers and/or deaths per 100 residents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection per day, averaged over a week. Results: The early vaccinated group included 136 facilities with 12,157 residents; the late vaccinated group included 144 facilities with 13,221 residents. After 1 week, early vaccinated facilities had a predicted 2.5 fewer incident SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 at-risk residents per week (95% CI: 1.2-4.0) compared with what would have been expected based on the experience of the late vaccinated facilities. The rates remained significantly lower for several weeks. Cumulatively over 5 weeks, the predicted reduction in new infections was 5.2 cases per 100 at-risk residents (95% CI: 3.2-7.3). By 5 to 8 weeks post-vaccine clinic, early vaccinated facilities had a predicted 1.1 to 3.8 fewer hospitalizations and/or deaths per 100 infected residents per day, averaged by week than expected based on late vaccinated facilities' experience for a cumulative on average difference of 5 events per 100 infected residents per day. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 vaccines seem to have accelerated the rate of decline of incident infections, morbidity, and mortality in this large multi-state nursing home population."
5154,Influence of Social and Cultural Factors on the Decision to Consent for Monoclonal Antibody Treatment among High-Risk Patients with Mild-Moderate COVID-19.,"Background: The clinical outcomes of patients who decline anti-spike monoclonal antibody therapies for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is not known. Factors associated with the decision to accept or decline the offer for anti-spike monoclonal antibody therapies are not established. This study aimed to identify factors impacting the decision to consent for monoclonal antibody therapies and assess the differences in clinical outcomes of patients who accepted compared to those who declined these therapies. Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 2820 adult patients who were offered monoclonal antibody therapies, bamlanivimab and casirivimab-imdevimab, for COVID-19 at Mayo Clinic in the Midwest between 11/19/2020 and 12/31/2020. The primary endpoint is the decision to accept or decline monoclonal antibody treatment. Secondary endpoints were patient-level factors that could have impacted the decision to accept treatment (age, gender, race, ethnicity, primary language spoken, and medical comorbidities). The main clinical endpoint was hospitalization within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: 59.1% (n = 1669) chose to accept monoclonal antibody therapy, and 40.9% (n = 1151) chose to decline the offer for treatment. Patients were more likely to accept treatment if they were non-Hispanic White, English speaking, identified a spouse or life partner, had a religious affiliation, and possessed more medical comorbidities. Overall, 28-day hospitalization rate was 2.6% (n = 72/2820) and was higher among those who declined (3.3%) than those who accepted monoclonal antibody therapy (2.0%; Rate Ratio = 0.62, 95% Confidence Interval, 0.39-0.98). Conclusions: Despite having more comorbidities, patients who accepted monoclonal antibody treatments had a lower rate of hospitalization compared to patients who declined treatment. Several social and cultural factors were associated with the decision to decline therapy, including race, language, ethnicity, and lack of social support. These findings can inform public health efforts to reduce social disparities in the treatment of COVID-19 and increase utilization of monoclonal antibody therapies in high risk populations."
5155,COVID-19; current situation and recommended interventions.,"Background: The new coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) that emerged at the end of 2019 was stated in China and infected millions of people around the world, with the highest spread rate amongst humans compared with other coronaviruses. This paper aimed to review and analyse the published studies about COVID-19 diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Method: The reviewed studies were clinical trials, in-vivo, in-vitro, guidelines, reports from the world health organization (WHO), and the centre for disease control and prevention (CDC) in addition to systemic reviews. All data extracted and analysed to stand on the latest updates and recommendations for fighting this severe attack of COVID-19. Results: Most important antiviral therapy of COVID-19 clinical trials is still running without clear results, but a few trials have indicated the role of numerous drugs in the treatment of COVID-19. Specific recommendations for aerosol therapy should be followed for the management of COVID-19. Conclusion: Nature of COVID-19 is still not very clear, however, management of the condition is similar to the previous attacks of coronaviruses."

5157,Lives and Costs Saved by Expanding and Expediting Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination.,"Background: With multiple coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines available, understanding the epidemiologic, clinical, and economic value of increasing coverage levels and expediting vaccination is important. Methods: We developed a computational model (transmission and age-stratified clinical and economics outcome model) representing the United States population, COVID-19 coronavirus spread (February 2020-December 2022), and vaccination to determine the impact of increasing coverage and expediting time to achieve coverage. Results: When achieving a given vaccination coverage in 270 days (70% vaccine efficacy), every 1% increase in coverage can avert an average of 876 800 (217 000-2 398 000) cases, varying with the number of people already vaccinated. For example, each 1% increase between 40% and 50% coverage can prevent 1.5 million cases, 56 240 hospitalizations, and 6660 deaths; gain 77 590 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); and save $602.8 million in direct medical costs and $1.3 billion in productivity losses. Expediting to 180 days could save an additional 5.8 million cases, 215 790 hospitalizations, 26 370 deaths, 206 520 QALYs, $3.5 billion in direct medical costs, and $4.3 billion in productivity losses. Conclusions: Our study quantifies the potential value of decreasing vaccine hesitancy and increasing vaccination coverage and how this value may decrease with the time it takes to achieve coverage, emphasizing the need to reach high coverage levels as soon as possible, especially before the fall/winter."
5158,Role of Tissue Engineering in COVID-19 and Future Viral Outbreaks.,"In light of the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as other viral outbreaks in the 21st century, there is a dire need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases worldwide. As a convergence science, tissue engineering has traditionally focused on the application of engineering principles to biological systems, collaboration across disciplines, and rapid translation of technologies from the benchtop to the bedside. Given these strengths, tissue engineers are particularly well suited to apply their skill set to the current crisis and viral outbreaks in general. This work introduces the basics of virology and epidemiology for tissue engineers, and highlights important developments in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the current pandemic, including in vitro model systems, vaccine technology, and small-molecule drug delivery. COVID-19 serves as a call to arms for scientists across all disciplines, and tissue engineers are well trained to be leaders and contributors in this time of need. Impact statement Given the steep mortality caused by the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is clear need for advances in diagnostics and therapeutics for viral outbreaks. Tissue engineering has the potential for critical impact on clinical outcomes in viral outbreaks. Tissue engineers, if mobilized, could play key roles as leaders in the outbreak, given their ability to apply engineering principles to biological processes, experience in collaborative environments, and penchant for technological translation from benchtop to bedside. In this work, three areas pioneered by tissue engineers that could be applied to the current COVID-19 crisis and future viral outbreaks are highlighted."
