810,"An update on COVID-19: SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, immunopathology, and BCG vaccination.","The causative agent of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 possesses RNA as a genetic material with 79% of the match with the bat SARS-CoV genome, which became epidemic in 2002. The SARS-CoV-2 peripheral Spike-Fc protein binds specifically to the ACE2 receptors present on bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes to downmodulates its expression which leads to severe acute respiratory failure. The disease is super infectious from human to human and the symptoms are similar to flu. The old aged and immunocompromised population are severely affected, and healthcare providers globally applied various strategies for treatment including the repurposing of drugs including antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine and anti-viral drugs.Herein, we described the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, immune responses, possible drug targets, vaccines under the trials and correlated the possibility of trained immunity induced by BCG vaccination over control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The countries with constraint BCG vaccination policy are struggling badly compared to countries with BCG vaccination policy. The BCG vaccination policy supports either lowering the total number of COVID-19 cases or the increasing recovery rate."
811,A patient with human coronavirus NL63 falsely diagnosed with COVID-19; Lesson learned for the importance of definitive diagnosis.,"The gold standard for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a nucleic acid detection test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which may occasionally reveal false-positive or false-negative results. Herein, we describe a case of a patient infected with human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) who was falsely diagnosed with COVID-19 using the Ampdirect™ 2019-nCoV detection kit (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) and SARS-CoV-2 Detection Kit (TOYOBO co., ltd.), and was admitted to a COVID-19 hospital ward. We suspected a cross-reaction between HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2; however, the reported genome sequences of HCoV-NL63 and N1/N2 primers for SARS-CoV-2 do not correspond. Thus, the PCR result was supposed to be a false positive possibly due to contamination or human error. Although the issue of a false-negative result has been the focus of much attention to prevent the spread of the disease, a false positive is fraught with problems as well. Physicians should recognize that unnecessary isolation violates human rights and a careful diagnosis is indispensable when the results of laboratory testing for COVID-19 are unclear. Generally, in cases such as a duplicate PCR test was partially positive, either N1 or N2 alone was positive, PCR testing for two or more target regions resulted in a positive only for single region, a high cycle threshold >35 was obtained, a false positive should be suspected. Especially, when these conditions coincide, we should recognize the high likelihood of a false positive."
812,Diagnosis of COVID-19 for controlling the pandemic: A review of the state-of-the-art.,"To date, health organizations and countries around the world are struggling to completely control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Scientists and researchers are developing tests for the rapid detection of individuals who may carry the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while striving to find a suitable vaccine to immunize healthy individuals. As there are clinically reported cases of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, fast and accurate diagnosis plays an important role in the control and further prevention of this disease. Herein, we present recent technologies and techniques that have been implemented for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We summarize the methods created by different research institutes as well as the commercial devices and kits developed by companies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The description of the existing methods is followed by highlighting their advantages and challenges. Finally, we propose some promising techniques that could potentially be applied to the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and tracing the asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 rapidly and accurately in the early stages of infection, based on reviewing the research studies on the detection of similar infectious viruses, especially severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus."

814,Establishing a high sensitivity detection method for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and developing a clinical application of this method.,"COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and was initially discovered in Wuhan. This outbreak quickly spread all over China and then to more than 20 other countries. SARS-CoV-2 fluorescent microsphere immunochromatographic test strips were prepared by the combination of time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay with a lateral flow assay. The analytical performance and clinical evaluation of this testing method was done and the clinical significance of the testing method was verified. The LLOD of SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgG and IgM was 0.121U/L and 0.366U/L. The specificity of IgM and IgG strips in healthy people and in patients with non-COVID-19 disease was 94%, 96.72% and 95.50%, 99.49%, respectively; and sensitivity of IgM and IgG strips for patients during treatment and follow-up was 63.02%, 37.61% and 87.28%, 90.17%, respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody test strip can provide rapid, flexible and accurate testing, and is able to meet the clinical requirement for rapid on-site testing of virus. The ability to detect IgM and IgG provided a significant benefit for the detection and prediction of clinical course with COVID-19 patients."
815,Sensitive tracking of circulating viral RNA through all stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"BACKGROUNDCirculating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA may represent a more reliable indicator of infection than nasal RNA, but quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) lacks diagnostic sensitivity for blood samples.METHODSA CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR assay that sensitively detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA was employed to analyze viral RNA kinetics in longitudinal plasma samples from nonhuman primates (NHPs) after virus exposure; to evaluate the utility of blood SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in adults cases confirmed by nasal/nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR results; and to identify suspected COVID-19 cases in pediatric and at-risk adult populations with negative nasal swab RT-qPCR results. All blood samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR to allow direct comparisons.RESULTSCRISPR-augmented RT-PCR consistently detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the plasma of experimentally infected NHPs from 1 to 28 days after infection, and these increases preceded and correlated with rectal swab viral RNA increases. In a patient cohort (n = 159), this blood-based assay demonstrated 91.2% diagnostic sensitivity and 99.2% diagnostic specificity versus a comparator RT-qPCR nasal/nasopharyngeal test, whereas RT-qPCR exhibited 44.1% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity for the same blood samples. This CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR assay also accurately identified patients with COVID-19 using one or more negative nasal swab RT-qPCR results.CONCLUSIONResults of this study indicate that sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood by CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR permits accurate COVID-19 diagnosis, and can detect COVID-19 cases with transient or negative nasal swab RT-qPCR results, suggesting that this approach could improve COVID-19 diagnosis and the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 infection clearance, and predict the severity of infection.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov.

816,"Evaluation on the use of Nanopore sequencing for direct characterization of coronaviruses from respiratory specimens, and a study on emerging missense mutations in partial RdRP gene of SARS-CoV-2.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a catastrophic burden to global healthcare systems. The fast spread of the etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), highlights the need to identify unknown coronaviruses rapidly for prompt clinical and public health decision making. Moreover, owing to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, periodic surveillance on emerging variants of key virus components is essential for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral drugs, diagnostic assays and vaccines. These 2 knowledge gaps formed the basis of this study. In the first place, we evaluated the feasibility of characterizing coronaviruses directly from respiratory specimens. We amplified partial RdRP gene, a stable genetic marker of coronaviruses, from a collection of 57 clinical specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 or other human coronaviruses, and sequenced the amplicons with Nanopore Flongle and MinION, the fastest and the most scalable massively-parallel sequencing platforms to-date. Partial RdRP sequences were successfully amplified and sequenced from 82.46% (47/57) of specimens, ranging from 75 to 100% by virus type, with consensus accuracy of 100% compared with Sanger sequences available (n = 40). In the second part, we further compared 19 SARS-CoV-2 RdRP sequences collected from the first to third waves of COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong with 22,173 genomes from GISAID EpiCoV™ database. No single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were found in our sequences, and 125 SNVs were observed from global data, with 56.8% being low-frequency (n = 1-47) missense mutations affecting the rear part of RNA polymerase. Among the 9 SNVs found on 4 conserved domains, the frequency of 15438G > T was highest (n = 34) and was predominantly found in Europe. Our data provided a glimpse into the sequence diversity of a primary antiviral drug and diagnostic target. Further studies are warranted to investigate the significance of these mutations."

819,Carrying out pseudo dual nucleic acid detection from sample to visual result in a polypropylene bag with CRISPR/Cas12a.,"Amplification-based nucleic acid detection is widely employed in food safety, medical diagnosis and environment monitoring. However, conventional nucleic acid analysis has to be carried out in laboratories because of requiring expensive instruments and trained personnel. If people could do nucleic acid detection at home by themselves, the application of nucleic acid detection would be greatly accelerated. We herein reported a polypropylene (PP) bag-based method for convenient detection of nucleic acids in the oil-sealed space. The PP bag has three chambers which are responsible for lysis, washing and amplification/detection, respectively. After adding sample, nucleic acids are adsorbed on magnetic particles (MPs) and moved into these three chambers successively through immiscible oil channel by an external magnet. Combined with isothermal amplification, the PP bag can be incubated in a water bath or milk warmer and acted as a reaction tube. With highly specific CRISPR technology, Salmonella typhimurium (St) and SARS-CoV-2 can be visually detected in these PP bags within 1 h, indicating its potential household application. To further improve the reliability of nucleic acid testing at home, a logic decision method is introduced by detecting both target and endogenous reference gene. Positive/negative/invalid detection result can be obtained by chronologically adding the CRISPR reagents of target and endogenous reference gene. We anticipate that this PP bag can provide a novel toolkit for nucleic acid detection in people's daily life."
