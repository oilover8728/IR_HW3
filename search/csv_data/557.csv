5561,Optimizing screening strategies for coronavirus disease 2019: A study from Middle China.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been highly epidemic in China since January 2020. Rapid detection of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is very important due to its high rate of infectivity. This study aimed to clarify the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Hubei province, China, and to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19 in attempts to contain spread of the virus. Methods: This retrospective study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hunan Provincial People's Hospital (Changsha, China) between January 22 and February 15, 2020. All cases were detected using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The epidemiology and clinical characteristic of these cases were investigated according to outcome in attempts to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19. Results: There were 24 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the fever outpatient department of Hunan Provincial People's Hospital. Three patients were asymptomatic, and 3 exhibited mild and 3 moderate disease. There was a family cluster phenomenon. Conclusion: Individuals with COVID-19 can be asymptomatic or exhibit mild manifestations of disease. Close monitoring and an optimized screening strategy for COVID-19 could help deter spread of the virus."

5564,Young Adult Perspectives on COVID-19 Vaccinations.,"Purpose: Young adults have the highest cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infection in the country. Using March 2021 Household Pulse Survey data, an ongoing, cross-sectional nationally representative survey, we examined U.S. young adult intention to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: Young adult (ages 18-25 years) Household Pulse Survey participants were queried on intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and related perspectives (N = 5,082). Results: Most unvaccinated respondents (76%) indicated an intention to become vaccinated. The most frequently cited reasons for potentially rejecting vaccination included desire to wait and see if the vaccine is safe (56%); concerns over side effects (53%); and believing others are in greater need of the vaccine (44%). Conclusions: With 24% of young adults hesitant to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, public health interventions should target reasons for hesitancy, address concerns about safety and side effects, and underscore the importance of vaccinations for this population."
5565,Implications of respiratory pathogen transmission dynamics on prevention and testing.,•Respiratory droplets can travel beyond current physical distancing recommendations.•Limited evidence of air pollution linked to respiratory transmission.•COVID-19 close contact and testing criteria may need to consider these findings.•Universal masking may provide a viable option against these transmission dynamics.
5566,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: a survey in a population highly compliant to common vaccinations.,"Vaccination is a key protective factor against COVID-19. Some vaccines have already received emergency authorization from Health Agencies, but growing skepticism and vaccine hesitancy will probably affect COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. In the attempt to shed light on this issue, we conducted an online survey in a population of parents referring to 4 pediatric practices in Naples, Italy in whom we evaluated potential vaccine acceptability in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, perception of personal health and of the impact of COVID-19, and attitudes toward general vaccination practices. Vaccination rates were analyzed also in the corresponding pediatric population.Almost 27% of participants declared they were in favor of vaccinations, and in fact real life vaccination rates in children exceeded the national mean. Only 26.5% of respondents declared they would receive COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine refusal was attributed to safety concerns in 76% of parents. Specific vaccine attributes further reduced the acceptance rate. Female gender, younger age and lower education level were associated with non-adherence to vaccination. Among extrinsic factors of COVID-19 vaccination, only information from National Health Authorities was significantly associated to vaccine acceptance.The rate of potential COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was very poor in our population of parents. Vaccine hesitancy was mainly due to safety concerns. Demographic and educational factors were correlated to vaccine acceptability. Health education and communication strategies are needed to achieve large-scale vaccine acceptability and finally herd immunity."
5567,No psychological vaccination: Vaccine hesitancy is associated with negative psychiatric outcomes among Israelis who received COVID-19 vaccination.,"Background: The widespread COVID-19 vaccination program, issued by the Israel Government, provides a unique opportunity to examine psychiatric morbidity and vaccine attitudes among individuals who have already been vaccinated. Accordingly, the current study examined how vaccine hesitancy contributes to clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic stress among individuals who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. Methods: We analyzed data obtained from 254 vaccinated individuals, and assessed vaccine hesitancy, depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress, as well as several demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors. Results: Logistic regressions demonstrated that above and beyond socio-demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was the most prominent risk factor for anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic distress. Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were found to double the risk for depression and peritraumatic stress (ORs > 2), and to triple the risk for anxiety (OR > 3). Limitations: A cross-sectional design; a preliminary study requiring further investigation CONCLUSIONS: This study points to the importance of vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated populations and provides knowledge regarding its associations with negative psychiatric outcomes. These findings may offer important information for healthcare practitioners and policy makers in their attempt to encourage individuals to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and emphasize the need to further understand the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric morbidity among vaccinated individuals."

5569,SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence trends in healthy blood donors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Milan.,"Background: The Milan metropolitan area in Northern Italy was among the most severely hit by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, and the risk factors and laboratory correlates of positive tests. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of evaluation, at the beginning of the first phase (February 24th to April 8th 2020; n=789). Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. Results: The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity (n=32/120 positive/negative controls, respectively), and the IgG test was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (n=34, p<0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7% (95% CI: 0.3-6%; p<0.0001 vs 120 historical controls). During the study period, characterised by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in the adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2% (95% CI: 2.4-9.0; 4.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-9.2% according to a Bayesian estimate) due to a rise in IgG reactivity to 5% (95% CI: 2.8-8.2; p=0.004 for trend), but there was no increase in IgM+ (p=not significant). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, IgG reactivity was more frequent in younger individuals (p=0.043), while IgM reactivity was more frequent in individuals aged >45 years (p=0.002). Discussion: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the start of the outbreak. The pattern of IgM/IgG reactivity was influenced by age: IgM was more frequently detected in participants aged >45 years. By the end of April, 2.4-9.0% of healthy adults had evidence of seroconversion."
