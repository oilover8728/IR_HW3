2961,U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Challenges Go Beyond Supply.,"Currently in Annals, a trio of articles each takes a different route to the same conclusion: Using initial supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to immunize as many persons as possible with a single-dose regimen may achieve more benefit than reserving supplies to administer a more effective 2-dose regimen to a smaller population. The editorialist discusses factors that may impede the timely vaccination of a substantial proportion of the U.S. population and the circumstances under which the ideas posited by the 3 articles for stretching vaccine supplies may have the greatest utility."

2963,A one-step real-time RT-PCR assay for simultaneous typing of SARS-CoV-2 mutations associated with the E484K and N501Y spike protein amino-acid substitutions.,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations resulting in the S protein amino-acid substitutions N501Y and E484K, which have been associated with enhanced transmissibility and immune escape, respectively, necessitates immediate actions, for which their rapid identification is crucial. For the simultaneous typing of both of these mutations of concern (MOCs), a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay employing four locked nucleic acid (LNA) modified TaqMan probes was developed. The assay is highly sensitive with a LOD of 117 copies/reaction, amplification efficiencies >94 % and a linear range of over 5 log10 copies/reaction. Validation of the assay using known SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative samples from human and animals revealed its ability to correctly identify wild type strains, and strains possessing either one or both targeted amino-acid substitutions, thus comprising a useful pre-screening tool for rapid MOC identification. The basic principles of the methodology for the development of the assay are explained in order to facilitate the rapid design of similar assays able to detect emerging MOCs."
2964,"Strategies to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 importation from international travellers: modelling estimations for the United Kingdom, July 2020.","BackgroundTo mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks from international air travellers, many countries implemented a combination of up to 14 days of self-quarantine upon arrival plus PCR testing in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.AimTo assess the effectiveness of quarantine and testing of international travellers to reduce risk of onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission into a destination country in the pre-COVID-19 vaccination era.MethodsWe used a simulation model of air travellers arriving in the United Kingdom from the European Union or the United States, incorporating timing of infection stages while varying quarantine duration and timing and number of PCR tests.ResultsQuarantine upon arrival with a PCR test on day 7 plus a 1-day delay for results can reduce the number of infectious arriving travellers released into the community by a median 94% (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 89-98) compared with a no quarantine/no test scenario. This reduction is similar to that achieved by a 14-day quarantine period (median > 99%; 95% UI: 98-100). Even shorter quarantine periods can prevent a substantial amount of transmission; all strategies in which travellers spend at least 5 days (mean incubation period) in quarantine and have at least one negative test before release are highly effective (median reduction 89%; 95% UI: 83-95)).ConclusionThe effect of different screening strategies impacts asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals differently. The choice of an optimal quarantine and testing strategy for unvaccinated air travellers may vary based on the number of possible imported infections relative to domestic incidence."
2965,"Clinical performance of four immunoassays for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, including a prospective analysis for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a real-life routine care setting.","Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical performance of four SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays and their contribution in routine care for the diagnosis of COVID-19, in order to benefit of robust data before their extensive use. Methods: The clinical performance of Euroimmun ELISA SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA, and DiaPro COVID-19 IgG confirmation were evaluated in the context of both a retrospective and a prospective analysis of COVID-19 patients. The retrospective analysis included plasma samples from 63 COVID-19 patients and 89 control (pre-pandemic) patients. The prospective study included 203 patients who tested either negative (n = 181) or positive (n = 22) by RT-PCR before serology sampling. Results: The specificity was 92.1 %, 98.9 %, 100 % and 98.9 % and the sensitivity 14 days after onset of symptoms was 95.6 %, 95.6 %, 97.8 % and 95.6 % for Euroimmun IgG, Abbott IgG, Wantai Ab, and DiaPro IgG confirmation SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, respectively. The low specificity of Euroimmun IgG (for ratio <5) was not confirmed in routine care setting (98.5 % negative agreement). Serology was complementary to RT-PCR in routine care and lead to identification of false positive (Ct>38, <2 targets detected) and false negative RT-PCR results (>1 month post onset of symptoms). Conclusions: Serology was complementary to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at least 14 days after onset of symptoms. First line serology testing can be performed with Wantai Ab or Abbott IgG assays, while DiaPro IgG confirmation assay can be used as an efficient confirmation assay."

2968,The role of ACE2 in the renin-angiotensin-system: Etiology and therapy of COVID-19 from a pharmaceutical perspective.,"Angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (ACE2), a key element of the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS), is not only the direct target of infection by the human SARS-Cov-2 virus but is at the same the root for the complex pathogenetic events of COVID-19. From a pharmaceutical perspective, several established classes of medicines are involved in different phases of the disease. From their known mechanisms of action, a comprehensive understanding of COVID-19 will be hopefully soon delineated. A set of proven medicines is available to cope at least with some of the pathologies involved. To arrive back to normal life, vaccinations and broad consideration of hygienic measures are to be complemented by effective medicines to treat airborne viral infections. Therapeutic schemes based on a comprehensive understanding of the disease will include drug combinations made up from both established drugs as well as novel drugs presently under development."
2969,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy - reasons and solutions to achieve a successful global vaccination campaign to tackle the ongoing pandemic.,"The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination drive aims to achieve global vaccination coverage that will help to control the pandemic. Therefore, the individuals who are reluctant to be vaccinated or forego COVID-19 vaccination can delay the progress of overall vaccination coverage, leading to slower vaccination rates and may create obstacles in global efforts to control the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 as unvaccinated individuals can act as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and could drive further outbreaks. Vaccine hesitancy is one of the major threats that directly impact global health as it challenges our ability to eradicate infectious diseases and achieve significant herd immunity through vaccination. One of the strategies to counter vaccine hesitancy is to follow a multisectoral approach that involves the collaboration between various stakeholders, such as government, private companies, religious groups, and other agencies, to leverage the knowledge, expertise, and resources, thereby enabling the creation of longstanding public trust of vaccines."
