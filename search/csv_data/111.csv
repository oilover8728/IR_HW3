1100,Rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic calls for a unified public health response.,"The globe has witnessed the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and emerging variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) that have broadly impacted the transmissibility, antigenicity, morbidity, and mortality of the virus. Although around 2.5 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, vaccine coverage remains far behind the minimum threshold needed to achieve herd immunity overall and it varies substantially by country. Many countries, and especially low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), are struggling with access to COVID-19 vaccines and a lack of personnel to perform mass vaccination. Effective nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are also not unanimously accepted and strictly complied with by the public and local communities. Moreover, the global fight against COVID-19 is and continues to face geopolitical, social, economic, and human rights concerns. Taken together, these circumstances call for a unified public health response with well-organized individual, local, national, and global efforts and actions to achieve success in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and achieving sustainable health and development goals."
1101,"A review: Epidemiology, pathogenesis and prospect in developing vaccines for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).","In December 2019, a large number of coronavirus cases were emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and rapidly spread to different countries and territories around the world within four months. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak as a global health emergency. The spread of COVID-19 over globe is highly contagious; they transmitted from person-to-person through small droplets of infected person. Many diagnosis and treatment methods have been implemented to reduce and control the outbreak. Efforts have been made to develop coronavirus vaccine against S protein or spike glycoprotein of coronavirus. COVID-19 outbreak will affect the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the world. At the time of preparing manuscript, total number of active cases reaches to more than 8.9 million and confirmed death reaches to approx. 4.6 lakh. This article highlights the ongoing research and advances in designing vaccine and therapeutics against COVID-19 and also focusing on the epidemiology, transmission, future direction and control the spread of infectious diseases."
1102,Why Do We Still Lack a COVID-19 Vaccine? Searching for the Missing Pieces.,
1103,"MicroRNAs and SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, pathogenesis, and mutations: biomarkers or therapeutic agents?","To date, proposed therapies and antiviral drugs have been failed to cure coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, at least two drug companies have applied for emergency use authorization with the United States Food and Drug Administration for their coronavirus vaccine candidates and several other vaccines are in various stages of development to determine safety and efficacy. Recently, some studies have shown the role of different human and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. miRNAs are non-coding single-stranded RNAs, which are involved in several physiological and pathological conditions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. They act as negative regulators of protein synthesis through binding to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the complementary target mRNA, leading to mRNA degradation or inhibition. The databases of Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for literature regarding the importance of miRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, pathogenesis, and genomic mutations. Furthermore, promising miRNAs as a biomarker or antiviral agent in COVID-19 therapy are reviewed."
1104,Nanotheranostics against COVID-19: From multivalent to immune-targeted materials.,"Destructive impacts of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide necessitates taking more appropriate measures for mitigating virus spread and development of the effective theranostic agents. In general, high heterogeneity of viruses is a major challenging issue towards the development of effective antiviral agents. Regarding the coronavirus, its high mutation rates can negatively affect virus detection process or the efficiency of drugs and vaccines in development or induce drug resistance. Bioengineered nanomaterials with suitable physicochemical characteristics for site-specific therapeutic delivery, highly-sensitive nanobiosensors for detection of very low virus concentration, and real-time protections using the nanorobots can provide roadmaps towards the imminent breakthroughs in theranostics of a variety of diseases including the COVID-19. Besides revolutionizing the classical disinfection procedures, state-of-the-art nanotechnology-based approaches enable providing the analytical tools for accelerated monitoring of coronavirus and associated biomarkers or drug delivery towards the pulmonary system or other affected organs. Multivalent nanomaterials capable of interaction with multivalent pathogens including the viruses could be suitable candidates for viral detection and prevention of further infections. Besides the inactivation or destruction of the virus, functionalized nanoparticles capable of modulating patient's immune response might be of great significance for attenuating the exaggerated inflammatory reactions or development of the effective nanovaccines and medications against the virus pandemics including the COVID-19."
1105,Single Dose of an mRNA Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) Vaccine Is Associated With Lower Nasopharyngeal Viral Load Among Nursing Home Residents With Asymptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"In nursing home residents with asymptomatic COVID-19 diagnosed through twice-weekly surveillance testing, single-dose BNT162b2 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech) was associated with -2.4 mean log10 lower nasopharyngeal viral load than detected in absence of vaccination (P = .004). Since viral load is linked to transmission, single-dose mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may help control outbreaks."
1106,Metagenomic Sequencing To Detect Respiratory Viruses in Persons under Investigation for COVID-19.,"Broad testing for respiratory viruses among persons under investigation (PUIs) for SARS-CoV-2 has been performed inconsistently, limiting our understanding of alternative viral infections and coinfections in these patients. RNA metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers an agnostic tool for the detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA respiratory viruses in PUIs. Here, we used RNA mNGS to assess the frequencies of alternative viral infections in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative PUIs (n = 30) and viral coinfections in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive PUIs (n = 45). mNGS identified all viruses detected by routine clinical testing (influenza A [n = 3], human metapneumovirus [n = 2], and human coronavirus OC43 [n = 2], and human coronavirus HKU1 [n = 1]). mNGS also identified both coinfections (1, 2.2%) and alternative viral infections (4, 13.3%) that were not detected by routine clinical workup (respiratory syncytial virus [n = 3], human metapneumovirus [n = 1], and human coronavirus NL63 [n = 1]). Among SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive PUIs, lower cycle threshold (CT ) values correlated with greater SARS-CoV-2 read recovery by mNGS (R 2, 0.65; P < 0.001). Our results suggest that current broad-spectrum molecular testing algorithms identify most respiratory viral infections among SARS-CoV-2 PUIs, when available and implemented consistently."
1107,Approach to Assessment of New Swabs and Viral Transport Media for SARS-CoV-2 Testing.,"In light of the present pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the unprecedented high demand for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing worldwide, there are shortages of established specimen collection devices for respiratory viral testing for diagnostic microbiology laboratories. This creates the need to validate unverified collection devices from manufacturers that may not be a registered supplier for medical devices. As clinical laboratories do not routinely perform quality control of established collection devices, there is a need to have a systematic, robust approach to the assessment of substitute unregistered collection swabs and viral transport media (VTM). A discussion of the aspects requiring consideration when determining the suitability and implementation of new collection devices is presented. These specific assessment criteria include an inspection of device integrity, determination of swab and VTM sterility and in vitro performance, VTM stability, and examination of the clinical performance of the device. This method was used in a front-line medical microbiology laboratory on swabs and VTM from an unregistered manufacturer, with suboptimal results that precluded implementation. As the pandemic continues, it will be important for diagnostic laboratories to adopt a flexible and streamlined approach to maintaining adequate supply chains for testing reagents and materials."
1108,The first 12 months of COVID-19: a timeline of immunological insights.,"Since the initial reports of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unidentified origin in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the novel coronavirus that causes this disease - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - has spread throughout the world, igniting the twenty-first century's deadliest pandemic. Over the past 12 months, a dizzying array of information has emerged from numerous laboratories, covering everything from the putative origin of SARS-CoV-2 to the development of numerous candidate vaccines. Many immunologists quickly pivoted from their existing research to focus on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and, owing to this unprecedented convergence of efforts on one viral infection, a remarkable body of work has been produced and disseminated, through both preprint servers and peer-reviewed journals. Here, we take readers through the timeline of key discoveries during the first year of the pandemic, which showcases the extraordinary leaps in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and highlights gaps in our knowledge as well as areas for future investigations."
1109,[Results of preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing in the coronavirus pandemic].,"Background: Surgery is challenging during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the preoperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in elective and emergency surgery and to calculate the patient contacts during hospital stay. Materials and methods: All surgeries defined by the German procedural classification (starting with a 5) from 1 June until 29 November 2020 were retrospectively evaluated regarding the preoperative SARS-CoV‑2 nasopharyngeal swab test. The results were then divided in emergency and elective surgeries. To show the personal contacts of the patients in a university hospital, we calculated the patient pathway within the department of urology and urosurgery for April 2020. Therefor we used the electronic patient records. Results: Altogether 7745 surgical procedures in 5985 patients were performed, whereby 39 (0.5%) SARS-CoV‑2 tests were positive. 2833 (37%) surgical procedures were emergency cases and 4912 (63%) were elective procedures. 25 (0.9%) of the emergency group and 14 (0.3%) of the elective surgeries had a positive SARS-CoV‑2 test. The average number of contacts in the patient room was 12.83 (0-50) and 84.22 (0-249) at the ward level, not counting contacts with the clinic staff. Conclusions: Nearly 1% of the preoperative SARS-CoV‑2 tests of either emergency or elective surgeries tested positive in the 6 months prior to November 2020. Although the risk of undetected SARS-CoV‑2 infection appears to be low in terms of costs and personnel, preoperative screening is useful in high-risk areas to ensure further necessary surgeries, especially concerning cancer patients and to prevent virus spread in a hospital."
