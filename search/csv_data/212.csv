2110,The potential risks of delaying the second vaccine dose during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,
2111,Role of Psychiatric Hospitals in the Equitable Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccines.,"Objective: This study examined the feasibility of offering COVID-19 vaccinations to patients in inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs). Methods: Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine relationships among measures of influenza immunization, transmission of transition records, and attainment of follow-up care with data from 1,602 IPFs in 2018 and the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index. Results: One-quarter of IPFs were in counties with high or very high COVID-19 vulnerability. On average, 84% of patients at IPFs were screened for influenza immunization status and were offered an immunization if indicated. Only 57% of patients had their records transmitted to another provider within 24 hours of discharge, and 50% had a follow-up visit with a mental health provider within 30 days. Scores on attainment of follow-up care were worse in counties with higher COVID-19 vulnerability. Conclusions: IPFs may be well positioned to offer COVID-19 vaccinations but will need new processes and improved rates of follow-up care to ensure that patients receive the second dose."
2112,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced cerebral venous thrombosis.,"The nosological entity of the cerebral venous thrombosis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination differs from the common cerebral venous thrombosis in that it is due to immune thrombocytopenia triggered by vaccination. Cerebral venous thrombosis is one of several manifestations of this type of immune thrombocytopenia. Albeit many general aspects of management of cerebral venous thrombosis are similar, immune thrombocytopenia requires a specific therapeutic approach, which is not normally adopted for cerebral venous thrombosis due to other causes, therefore its early recognition is essential."
2113,Review of Current Advances in Serologic Testing for COVID-19.,"Objectives: To examine and summarize the current literature on serologic methods for the detection of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: A literature review was performed using searches in databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Thirty-two peer-reviewed papers and 23 preprints were examined. Results: The studies included lateral flow immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescence immunoassay, and neutralizing antibody assays. The use of all major SARS-CoV-2 antigens was demonstrated to have diagnostic value. Assays measuring total antibody reactivity had the highest sensitivity. In addition, all the methods provided opportunities to characterize the humoral immune response by isotype. The combined use of IgM and IgG detection resulted in a higher sensitivity than that observed when detecting either isotype alone. Although IgA was rarely studied, it was also demonstrated to be a sensitive marker of infection, and levels correlated with disease severity and neutralizing activity. Conclusions: The use of serologic testing, in conjunction with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, was demonstrated to significantly increase the sensitivity of detection of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There was conflicting evidence regarding whether antibody titers correlated with clinical severity. However, preliminary investigations indicated some immunoassays may be a surrogate for the prediction of neutralizing antibody titers and the selection of recovered patients for convalescent serum donation."
2114,COVID-19 pathophysiology and pharmacology: what do we know and how did Canadians respond? A review of Health Canada authorized clinical vaccine and drug trials.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in the death of over 18 000 Canadians and has impacted the lives of all Canadians. Many Canadian research groups have expanded their research programs to include COVID-19. Over the past year, our knowledge of this novel disease has grown and has led to the initiation of a number of clinical vaccine and drug trials for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Here, we review SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) and the natural history of COVID-19, including a timeline of disease progression after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We also review the pathophysiological effects of COVID-19 on the organ systems that have been implicated in the disease, including the lungs, upper respiratory tract, immune system, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal organs, the liver, and the kidneys. Then we review general therapeutics strategies that are being applied and investigated for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19, including vaccines, antivirals, immune system enhancers, pulmonary supportive agents, immunosuppressants and (or) anti-inflammatories, and cardiovascular system regulators. Finally, we provide an overview of all current Health Canada authorized clinical drug and vaccine trials for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19."
2115,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain Antibody using a HiBiT-Based Bioreporter.,"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for better serological detection methods to determine the epidemiologic impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 infections raises the need for better antibody detection assays. Current antibody detection methods compromise sensitivity for speed or are sensitive but time-consuming. A large proportion of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies target the receptor-binding domain (RBD), one of the primary immunogenic compartments of SARS-CoV-2. We have recently designed and developed a highly sensitive, bioluminescent-tagged RBD (NanoLuc HiBiT-RBD) to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The following text describes the procedure to produce the HiBiT-RBD complex and a fast assay to evaluate the presence of RBD-targeting antibodies using this tool. Due to the durability of the HiBiT-RBD protein product over a wide range of temperatures and the shorter experimental procedure that can be completed within 1 h, the protocol can be considered as a more efficient alternative to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient serum samples."
2116,Relative sensitivity of anterior nares and nasopharyngeal swabs for initial detection of SARS-CoV-2 in ambulatory patients: Rapid review and meta-analysis.,"Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are considered ""gold standard"" for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections, but anterior nares or mid-turbinate swabs (nasal swabs) are often used. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the sensitivity of nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs against a composite reference standard for the initial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory patients. The study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020221827). Data sources included studies appearing between January 1, 2020 and March 20, 2021, identified by searches of PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. Studies included at least 20 subjects who simultaneously provided nasal and nasopharyngeal specimens for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, and for which confusion matrices could be constructed. Authors individually assessed studies for inclusion and compared assessments. Each author independently extracted all data elements; differences were reconciled by review of initial data sources. Extracted data included specimen site, patient characteristics, collection site, and confusion matrices comparing results for nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs. Assessed against a composite reference standard, anterior nares swabs are less sensitive (82% - 88%) than nasopharyngeal swabs (98%). For populations with 10% specimen positivity, the negative predictive values of all swab types were greater than 98%. Mid-turbinate and anterior nares swabs seem to perform similarly. The lower sensitivity associated with nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is justified by the ability to screen more patients and reduced personal protective equipment requirements. Our conclusions are limited by the small number of studies and the significant heterogeneity of study designs and study outcomes."
2117,SARS-CoV-2 detection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing: Analysis of false positive results and recommendations for quality control measures.,"Testing for SARS-CoV-2 has become a critical component for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are currently the predominate method for testing. Quality control (QC) measures utilize known positive and known negative controls to ensure the adequacy of extraction and RT-PCR steps but do not evaluate all components of testing. We have conducted a quality assurance review of our RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 to determine the rate of false positive results in asymptomatic patients and causes for these errors. Design: We have developed a quality control procedure in which all specimens from asymptomatic unexposed persons with SARS-CoV-2 positive tests were retested. When a second test was ""non-detected"" a third test was performed and a root cause analysis of the erroneous result undertaken. Results: In the study period, 24,717 samples were tested and 6251 were from asymptomatic patients. Of the 288 initial positive tests, 20 (6.9%) were negative on retesting. Review of cycle threshold curves, technologists' records, location of specimen on testing plates and relationships with high viral load specimens was undertaken. Analysis revealed technologists' errors (misplacement of specimen in testing plate or contamination) and cross contamination from high viral load specimens in adjacent wells of testing plates were common causes for false positive results. Discussion: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is associated with a small number of false positive results, most easily recognized in asymptomatic non-exposed patients. Implementation of a limited retesting protocol identifies clinically significant testing errors and allows review and improvement of laboratory procedures."
2118,No secret hiding place? Absence of SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface of 1145 hospitalized patients in a pandemic area.,"Objectives: The aims of this study were to evaluate the isolated prevalence of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface without systemic infection in hospitalized asymptomatic patients and to determine the risk for ophthalmologists and medical staff to be infected by prescreened asymptomatic patients in a tertiary eye care center. Methods: In this prospective, observational study, bilateral swaps of the conjunctiva in the lower fornices as well as nasopharyngeal swaps were collected in 1145 hospitalized asymptomatic patients of a tertiary eye care center. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed for each swap to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Demographic data and potential risk factors for an isolated infection of the ocular surface were noted. Results: Two thousand two hundred eighty-eight (99.9%) of all 2290 tested eyes had negative results in the RT-PCR analysis of the conjunctival swabs. One patient had bilateral false-positive results in the conjunctival swabs. None of the 1145 patients had any positive RT-PCR-confirmed result in the nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusions: The risk for an isolated conjunctival viral activity in patients with a negative nasopharyngeal swab-based RT-PCR seems to be absent or extremely low, suggesting no need to perform additional conjunctival swabs in patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs. Furthermore, the risk of a work-related SARS-CoV-2 infection due to direct contact with preselected asymptomatic patients in an eye care center is very low, especially when additional hygiene standards and safe distances are respected carefully. This might reassure medical staff and reduce the fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
