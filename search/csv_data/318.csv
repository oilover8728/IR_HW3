3172,"Evolution, Mode of Transmission, and Mutational Landscape of Newly Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants.","The recent emergence of multiple variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a significant concern for public health worldwide. New variants have been classified either as variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs) by the CDC (USA) and WHO. The VOCs include lineages such as B.1.1.7 (20I/501Y.V1 variant), P.1 (20J/501Y.V3 variant), B.1.351 (20H/501Y.V2 variant), and B.1.617.2. In contrast, the VOI category includes B.1.525, B.1.526, P.2, and B.1.427/B.1.429. The WHO provided the alert for last two variants (P.2 and B.1.427/B.1.429) and labeled them for further monitoring. As per the WHO, these variants can be reclassified due to their status at a particular time. At the same time, the CDC (USA) has marked these two variants as VOIs up through today. This article analyzes the evolutionary patterns of all these emerging variants, as well as their geographical distributions and transmission patterns, including the circulating frequency, entropy diversity, and mutational event diversity throughout the genomes of all SARS-CoV-2 lineages. The transmission pattern was observed highest in the B.1.1.7 lineage. Our frequency evaluation found that this lineage achieved 100% frequency in early October 2020. We also critically evaluated the above emerging variants mutational landscape and significant spike protein mutations (E484K, K417T/N, N501Y, and D614G) impacting public health. Finally, the effectiveness of vaccines against newly SARS-CoV-2 variants was also analyzed. IMPORTANCE Irrespective of the aggressive vaccination drive, the newly emerging multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants are causing havoc in several countries. As per the CDC (USA) and WHO, the VOCs include the B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 lineages, while the VOIs include the B.1.525, B.1.526, P.2, and B.1.427/B.1.429 lineages. This study analyzed the evolutionary patterns, geographical distributions and transmission patterns, circulating frequency, entropy diversity, and mutational event diversity throughout the genome of significant SARS-CoV-2 lineages. A higher transmission pattern was observed for the B.1.1.7 variant. The study also evaluated the mutational landscape and important spike protein mutations (E484K, K417T/N, N501Y, and D614G) of all of the above variants. Finally, a survey was performed on the efficacy of vaccines against these variants from the previously published literature. The results presented in this article will help design future countrywide pandemic planning strategies for the emerging variants, next-generation vaccine development using alternative wild-type antigens and significant viral antigens, and immediate planning for ongoing vaccination programs worldwide."

3174,Pushing beyond specifications: Evaluation of linearity and clinical performance of the cobas 6800/8800 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for reliable quantification in blood and other materials outside recommendations.,"Background: The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a unique challenge to diagnostic laboratories. There are preliminary studies correlating qRT-PCR results from different materials to clinical outcomes, yet, comparability is limited due to the plethora of different assays used for diagnostics. In this study we evaluate clinical performance and linear range for the SARS-CoV-2 IVD (cobas6800/8800 system, a fully automated sample-to-result platform) in different clinically relevant matrix materials outside official specifications. Methods: Assay performance was assessed in human plasma, BAL/BL and transport medium following chemical inactivation. For analytical evaluation, respective matrix materials were spiked with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ten-fold dilution series. The efficacy of chemical inactivation by guanidine hydrochloride solution was confirmed in cell culture infectivity experiments. For correlation, a total of 289 predetermined clinical samples including respiratory swabs, plasma and lower respiratory tract specimens were subjected to the SARS-CoV-2 IVD test and results were compared. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 IVD showed excellent linearity over four to six log steps depending on matrix material. Chemical inactivation resulted in a reduction in plaque forming units of at least 3.5 log steps, while having no significant impact on assay performance. Inter-run consistency from three different testing sites demonstrated excellent comparability of RT-PCR results (maximum deviation was 1.53 CT). Clinical evaluation for respiratory swabs showed very good agreement with the comparator assay (Positive agreement 95.7 %, negative agreement 98.9 %). Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 IVD test for the cobas6800/8800 systems offers excellent linear range and inter-run consistency for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different matrices outside official specifications."

3176,Tuberculosis and COVID-19: An overlapping situation during pandemic.,"Introduction: The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). First COVID-19 case was detected in March, 10, 2020 in Turkey and as of May, 18, 2020 148,067 cases have been identified and 4096 citizens have died. Tuberculosis (TB) is a worldwide public health concern, incidence of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people) in Turkey was reported at 14, 1 in 2018. During pandemic COVID-19 was the main concern in every clinic and as we discuss here overlapping respiratory diseases may result in delaying of the diagnosis and treatment. Methodology: There were 4605 respiratory samples examined between March 23 and May 18 for COVID-19 and 185 samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in our laboratory. The Xpert Ultra assay was performed for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis in combined nasopharyngeal and deep oropharyngeal swabs of suspected cases of COVID-19. Results: Both of SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis tests were requested on the clinical and radiological grounds in 30 patients. Here we discussed 2 patients who were both COVID-19 and TB positive. One patient already diagnosed with tuberculosis become COVID-19 positive during hospitalization and another patient suspected and treated for COVID-19 received the final diagnosis of pulmonary TB and Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Conclusions: We want to emphasize that while considering COVID-19 primarily during these pandemic days, we should not forget one of the ""great imitators"", tuberculosis within differential diagnoses."

3179,Multianalyte serology in home-sampled blood enables an unbiased assessment of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2.,"Serological testing is essential to curb the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most assays are still limited to single analytes and samples collected within healthcare. Thus, we establish a multianalyte and multiplexed approach to reliably profile IgG and IgM levels against several versions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, RBD, N) in home-sampled dried blood spots (DBS). We analyse DBS collected during spring of 2020 from 878 random and undiagnosed individuals from the population in Stockholm, Sweden, and use classification approaches to estimate an accumulated seroprevalence of 12.5% (95% CI: 10.3%-14.7%). This includes 5.4% of the samples being IgG+IgM+ against several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, as well as 2.1% being IgG-IgM+ and 5.0% being IgG+IgM- for the virus' S protein. Subjects classified as IgG+ for several SARS-CoV-2 proteins report influenza-like symptoms more frequently than those being IgG+ for only the S protein (OR = 6.1; p < 0.001). Among all seropositive cases, 30% are asymptomatic. Our strategy enables an accurate individual-level and multiplexed assessment of antibodies in home-sampled blood, assisting our understanding about the undiagnosed seroprevalence and diversity of the immune response against the coronavirus."
