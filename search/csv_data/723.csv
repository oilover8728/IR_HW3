7220,Analysis of blood donors' characteristics and deferrals related to COVID-19 in Iran.,"Background: With the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in 2019, called COVID-19, Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO) implemented the new deferrals. This study analyzed the COVID-19 deferrals of blood volunteers and compared the demographics, deferrals, and the donor status during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019. Study design and methods: Data were collected from the integrated blood donor database between Feb-Apr 2019 and 2020. Deferral reasons of COVID-19 were categorized as: those who have symptoms or live with a symptomatic family member, have direct exposure with a confirmed case, have travelled from the outbreak affected areas, and have fully recovered from confirmed COVID-19. The z-test analysis was used, and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated to compare the sample proportions. Results: The blood donations dropped to 26.09 % in 2020. The percent change of first-time blood donors, female donors, and donors within the age group of 45-54 years old was significantly greater in 2020 than the same time frame in 2019 (p < 0.05). The results showed that 0.58 % of volunteers were deferred from blood donation to avoid transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The rate of COVID-19 deferrals in all types except travelling to affected areas has increased in the second 30-day of the study (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The blood shortage that occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak was not due to increased deferral for COVID-19, but it was mostly due to a decrease in the number of volunteers who referred to BTCs."
7221,CRISPR-Cas System: An Approach With Potentials for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Therapeutics.,"COVID-19, the human coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was reported for the first time in Wuhan, China in late 2019. COVID-19 has no preventive vaccine or proven standard pharmacological treatment, and consequently, the outbreak swiftly became a pandemic affecting more than 215 countries around the world. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, the only reliable diagnostics is a qPCR assay. Among other diagnostic tools, the CRISPR-Cas system is being investigated for rapid and specific diagnosis of COVID-19. The CRISPR-Cas-based methods diagnose the SARS-CoV-2 infections within an hour. Apart from its diagnostic ability, CRISPR-Cas system is also being assessed for antiviral therapy development; however, till date, no CRISPR-based therapy has been approved for human use. The Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells (PAC-MAN), which is Cas 13 based strategy, has been developed against coronavirus. Although this strategy has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic modality, it may face significant challenges for approval in human clinical trials. This review is focused on describing potential use and challenges of CRISPR-Cas based approaches for the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic technique and/or a possible therapeutic alternative for combating COVID-19. The assessment of potential risks associated with use of CRISPR will be important for future clinical advancements."
7222,Importance of Pediatric Inclusion in COVID-19 Therapeutic Trials.,"Pediatric patients are excluded from most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapeutic trials. We outline a rationale for the inclusion of children in COVID-19 therapeutic trials, which enabled us to include children of all ages in a therapeutic COVID-19 trial at our institution."
7223,SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce broad CD4+ T cell responses that recognize SARS-CoV-2 variants and HCoV-NL63.,"Recent studies have shown T cell cross-recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and common cold coronavirus spike proteins. However, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on T cell responses to common cold coronaviruses (CCCs) remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed CD4+ T cell responses to spike peptides from SARS-CoV-2 and 3 CCCs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) before and after study participants received Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine recipients showed broad T cell responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and we identified 23 distinct targeted peptides in 9 participants, including 1 peptide that was targeted in 6 individuals. Only 4 of these 23 targeted peptides would potentially be affected by mutations in the UK (B.1.1.7) and South African (B.1.351) variants, and CD4+ T cells from vaccine recipients recognized the 2 variant spike proteins as effectively as they recognized the spike protein from the ancestral virus. Interestingly, we observed a 3-fold increase in the CD4+ T cell responses to HCoV-NL63 spike peptides after vaccination. Our results suggest that T cell responses elicited or enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines may be able to control SARS-CoV-2 variants and lead to cross-protection against some endemic coronaviruses."

7225,"In Vitro and In Vivo Models for Studying SARS-CoV-2, the Etiological Agent Responsible for COVID-19 Pandemic.","The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has prompted the scientific community to rapidly develop in vitro and in vivo models that could be applied in COVID-19 research. In vitro models include two-dimensional (2D) cultures of immortalized cell lines or primary cells and three-dimensional (3D) cultures derived from lung, alveoli, bronchi, and other organs. Although cell-based systems are economic and allow strict control of experimental variables, they do not always resemble physiological conditions. Thus, several in vivo models are being developed, including different strains of mice, hamsters, ferrets, dogs, cats, and non-human primates. In this review, we summarize the main models of SARS-CoV-2 infection developed so far and discuss their advantages, drawbacks and main uses."
7226,"Media Influence on Anxiety, Health Utility, and Health Beliefs Early in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic-a Survey Study.","Background: The psychological effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and response are poorly understood. Objective: To understand the effects of the pandemic and response on anxiety and health utility in a nationally representative sample of US adults. Design: A de-identified, cross-sectional survey was administered at the end of April 2020. Probability weights were assigned using estimates from the 2018 American Community Survey and Integrated Public Use Microdata Series Estimates. Participants: US adults 18-85 years of age with landline, texting-enabled cellphone, or internet access. Intervention: Seven split-half survey blocks of 30 questions, assessing demographics, COVID-19-related health attitudes, and standardized measures of generalized self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, personality, and generic health utility. Main measures: State/Trait anxiety scores, EQ-5D-3L Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, and demographic predictors of these scores. Key results: Among 4855 respondents, 56.7% checked COVID-19-related news several times daily, and 84.4% at least once daily. Only 65.7% desired SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for themselves, and 70.1% for their child. Mean state anxiety (S-anxiety) score was significantly higher than mean trait anxiety (T-anxiety) score (44.9, 95%CI 43.5-46.3 vs. 41.6, 95%CI 38.7-44.5; p = 0.03), with both scores significantly higher than previously published norms. In an adjusted regression model, less frequent news viewing was associated with significantly lower S-anxiety score. Mean EQ-5D-3L VAS score for the population was significantly lower vs. established US normative data (71.4 CI 67.4-75.5, std. error 2 vs. societal mean 80, std. error 0.1; p < 0.001). EQ-5D-3L VAS score was bimodal (highest with hourly and no viewing) and significantly reduced with less media viewership in an adjusted model. Conclusions: Among a nationally representative sample, there were higher S-anxiety and lower EQ-5D-3L VAS scores compared to non-pandemic normative data, indicative of a potential detrimental acute effect of the pandemic. More frequent daily media viewership was significantly associated with higher S-anxiety but also predictive of higher health utility, as measured by EQ-5D-3L VAS scores."
7227,Sequence Analysis and Structure Prediction of SARS-CoV-2 Accessory Proteins 9b and ORF14: Evolutionary Analysis Indicates Close Relatedness to Bat Coronavirus.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a single-stranded RNA genome that encodes 14 open reading frames (ORFs), eight of which encode accessory proteins that allow the virus to infect the host and promote virulence. The genome expresses around 29 structural and nonstructural protein products. The accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are not essential for virus replication but do affect viral release, stability, and pathogenesis and finally contribute to virulence. This paper has attempted the structure prediction and functional analysis of two such accessory proteins, 9b and ORF14, in the absence of experimental structures. Sequence analysis, structure prediction, functional characterization, and evolutionary analysis based on the UniProtKB reviewed the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 9b (P0DTD2) and ORF14 (P0DTD3) proteins. Modeling has been presented with the introduction of hybrid comparative and ab initio modeling. QMEANDisCo 4.0.0 and ProQ3 for global and local (per residue) quality estimates verified the structures as high quality, which may be attributed to structure-based drug design targets. Tunnel analysis revealed the presence of 1-2 highly active tunneling sites, perhaps which will able to provide certain inputs for advanced structure-based drug design or to formulate potential vaccines in the absence of a complete experimental structure. The evolutionary analysis of both proteins of human SARS-CoV-2 indicates close relatedness to the bat coronavirus. The whole-genome phylogeny indicates that only the new bat coronavirus followed by pangolin coronaviruses has a close evolutionary relationship with the novel SARS-CoV-2."
7228,Molecular Diagnosis of a Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Causing an Outbreak of Pneumonia.,"Background: A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. Methods: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. Results: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests. Conclusions: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients."
