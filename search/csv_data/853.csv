8520,Doxycycline Inhibition of a Pseudotyped Virus Transduction Does Not Translate to Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity.,"The rapid spread of the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has created an unusual situation, with rapid searches for compounds to interfere with the biological processes exploited by the virus. Doxycycline, with its pleiotropic effects, including anti-viral activity, has been proposed as a therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and about twenty clinical trials have started since the beginning of the pandemic. To gain information on the activity of doxycycline against SARS-CoV-2 infection and clarify some of the conflicting clinical data published, we designed in vitro binding tests and infection studies with a pseudotyped virus expressing the spike protein, as well as a clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain. Doxycycline inhibited the transduction of the pseudotyped virus in Vero E6 and HEK-293 T cells stably expressing human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 but did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. Although this conclusion is apparently disappointing, it is paradigmatic of an experimental approach aimed at developing an integrated multidisciplinary platform which can shed light on the mechanisms of action of potential anti-COVID-19 compounds. To avoid wasting precious time and resources, we believe very stringent experimental criteria are needed in the preclinical phase, including infectivity studies with clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2, before moving on to (futile) clinical trials."
8521,Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Patients Infected with 2019-New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A Review and Perspective.,"Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment. In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed. Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity are also introduced."
8522,Proficiency testing and ring trials.,"The validation of diagnostic methods (and the subsequent results generated by a laboratory) are improved through participation in inter-laboratory comparisons (IC), such as proficiency-testing (PT) programmes and other exercises referred to as 'ring tests' or 'ring trials' (RTs). This is a requirement to comply with international quality standards. Validating a method is a continuous process and taking part in ongoing PT programmes supports the management of a method's life cycle, providing continuing assessment of fitness (sometimes referred to as the 'validation retention status'). Proficiency-testing panel designs ensure that the methods used, particularly diagnostic specificity and sensitivity, are suitably challenged. Appraising PT results over time can illustrate whether the laboratory's performance is stable, improving or worsening, and proficiency tests can also highlight variations in the performance of assays. The development of new proficiency tests can support the implementation of novel diagnostics technologies, such as whole genome sequencing and point-of-care testing, and assist in cross-sectoral partnerships focusing on One Health approaches, which are high on the agenda for infectious disease control. For example, the rapid design and distribution of emergency exempted assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) means that these assays were not as rigorously evaluated as assays for established infectious diseases. Therefore, participation in PT programmes for SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand the performance of these assays. While other mechanisms help to underpin laboratory activities, PT has been, and should remain, an integral part of laboratory quality assurance. Resources must be directed towards increasing and improving the quality of PT (for example, availability and accessibility of suitable biological and reference materials are essential for a PT provider to execute its duties), to support established and novel methods such as genomic and point-of-care tests."
8523,A 78-Year-Old Woman With Diarrhea and Respiratory Failure.,"A 78-year-old woman was admitted to the ED with a 10-day history of diarrhea and recent onset of dry cough, fever, and asthenia. She had a medical history of obesity (BMI 32) and arterial hypertension treated with irbesartan. In the context of a large-scale lockdown in France during the COVID-19 pandemic, she only had physical contact with her husband, who did not report any symptoms. She required mechanical ventilation because of severe hypoxemia within 1 hour after admission to the ED."
8524,Experimental Infection of Cattle with SARS-CoV-2.,"We inoculated 6 cattle with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and kept them together with 3 uninoculated cattle. We observed viral replication and specific seroreactivity in 2 inoculated animals, despite high levels of preexisting antibody titers against a bovine betacoronavirus. The in-contact animals did not become infected."
8525,"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Adults after Mild SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Japan.","In Japan, a 51-year-old man had minimally symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome was diagnosed ≈5 weeks later; characteristics included severe inflammation, cardiac dysfunction, and IgG positivity. Clinicians should obtain detailed history and examine IgG levels for cases of inflammatory disease with unexplained cardiac decompensation."
8526,COVID-19: Molecular and Cellular Response.,"In late December 2019, a vtiral pneumonia with an unknown agent was reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent. Because of the human-to-human transmission and rapid spread; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly increased to an epidemic scale and poses a severe threat to human health; it has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review aims to summarize the recent research progress of COVID-19 molecular features and immunopathogenesis to provide a reference for further research in prevention and treatment of SARS coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection based on the knowledge from researches on SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV)."
8527,Assessment of Sensitivity and Specificity of Patient-Collected Lower Nasal Specimens for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2Testing.,This prognostic study compares the diagnostic equivalence of patient-collected lower nasal specimens with that of health care worker–collected oropharyngeal specimens for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing.
8528,"COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 12 (Reporting week to 23:59 AEST 19 April 2020).","Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 19 April 2020: notifications = 6,606; deaths = 69. The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked. The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.0%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.8%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (4.7%) and the United Kingdom (13.5%). The low CFR is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment enables public health response and reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures."
8529,"Early transmissibility assessment of the N501Y mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the United Kingdom, October to November 2020.","Two new SARS-CoV-2 lineages with the N501Y mutation in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein spread rapidly in the United Kingdom. We estimated that the earlier 501Y lineage without amino acid deletion Δ69/Δ70, circulating mainly between early September and mid-November, was 10% (6-13%) more transmissible than the 501N lineage, and the 501Y lineage with amino acid deletion Δ69/Δ70, circulating since late September, was 75% (70-80%) more transmissible than the 501N lineage."
