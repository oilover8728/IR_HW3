6410,Correlation between BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine-associated hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy and humoral immunity in patients with hematologic malignancy.,"Purpose: Vaccine-associated hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (VAHL) is frequently observed on [18F]FDG PET-CT following BNT162b2 administration. Recent data suggest a prominent B cell germinal-center (GC) response elicited by mRNA vaccines in draining lymph nodes. Thus, in this study we aimed to explore the correlation between VAHL and humoral immunity as reflected by post-vaccination serologic testing and by comparing the incidence of VAHL between lymphoma patients treated recently with B cell depleting therapy and those that were not. Methods: A total of 137 patients with hematologic malignancy that had post-vaccination [18F]FDG PET-CT were included (All-PET group), 86 received both vaccine doses before imaging (PET-2 group). Their VAHL status and grade on imaging were recorded. Among 102 lymphoma patients, 34 (33.3%) were treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy. A subgroup of 54 patients also underwent serologic testing 2-3 weeks after the booster dose, and their anti-spike titers were recorded and graded as well. Results: The overall incidence of VAHL in patients with hematologic malignancy was 31.4%. The 34 lymphoma patients treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy had significantly lower rates of VAHL comparted with all other lymphoma patients (8.8 versus 41.2% in all-PET patients, Pv < 0.01). VAHL rates were 10% in patients with negative serology, 31.3% in patients with low anti-spike titers, and 72.2% in patients with high anti-spike titers. The positive predictive values of VAHL were 90 and 93.3% in all-PET and PET-2 patients, respectively. A positive statistically significant correlation was found between VAHL and serology ranks in All-PET patients (rs = 0.530, Pv < 0.001), and stronger correlation was found in PET-2 patients (rs = 0.642, Pv < 0.001). Conclusion: VAHL on [18F]FDG PET-CT of patients with hematologic malignancy may reflect GC B cell proliferation and an effective humoral response elicited by BNT162b2 vaccine."
6411,[CME/Answers: Hypertension and the COVID-19 Pandemic: What to Consider in Medical Practice].,"CME/Answers: Hypertension and the COVID-19 Pandemic: What to Consider in Medical Practice Abstract. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health problem. A fraction of the population is at increased risk of developing complications of this disease, in particular older subjects as well as diabetic, obese and hypertensive patients. With regard to patients with high blood pressure, the existence of an increased risk remains to be confirmed in large controlled trials. So far the findings regarding this question are reassuring, whether these patients are treated or not. There seems to be no reason to worry when using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. The observations available to date suggest that COVID-19 vaccine can be administered safely to hypertensive patients. In conclusion, there is no reason to implement changes in the care of hypertensive patients due to the pandemic."
6412,Diagnostic and analytical performance evaluation of ten commercial assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response.,"Objective: Analytical validation of newly released SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in the clinical laboratory is crucial to ensure sufficient performance in respect to its intended use. We aimed to assess analytical and diagnostic performance of 8 (semi-)quantitative assays detecting anti-nucleocapsid IgG (Euroimmun, Id-Vet) or total Ig (Roche), anti-spike protein IgG (Euroimmun, Theradiag, DiaSorin, Thermo Fisher) or both (Theradiag) and 2 rapid lateral flow assays (LFA) (AAZ-LMB and Theradiag). Methods: Specificity was evaluated using a cross-reactivity panel of 85 pre-pandemic serum samples. Sensitivity was determined at both the manufacturer's and a 95% specificity cut-off level, using 81 serum samples of patients with a positive rRT-PCR. Sensitivity was determined in function of time post symptoms onset. Results: Specificity for all assays ranged from 92.9% to 100% (Roche and Thermo Fisher) with the exception of the Theradiag IgM LFA (82.4%). Sensitivity in asymptomatic patients ranged between 41.7% and 58.3%. Sensitivity on samples taken <10 days since symptom onset was low (23.3%-66.7%) and increased on samples taken between 10 and 20 days and > 20 days since symptom onset (80%-96% and 92.9%-100%, respectively). From 20 days after symptom onset, the Roche, Id-vet and Thermo Fisher assays all met the sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (>97%) targets determined by the WHO. Antibody signal response was significantly higher in the critically ill patient group. Conclusion: Antibody detection can complement rRT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially in the later stage, or in asymptomatic patients for epidemiological purposes. Addition of IgM in LFAs did not improve sensitivity."
6413,COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories: The need for cognitive inoculation against misinformation to improve vaccine adherence.,"Introduction: Rumors and conspiracy theories, can contribute to vaccine hesitancy. Monitoring online data related to COVID-19 vaccine candidates can track vaccine misinformation in real-time and assist in negating its impact. This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories circulating on online platforms, understand their context, and then review interventions to manage this misinformation and increase vaccine acceptance. Method: In June 2020, a multi-disciplinary team was formed to review and collect online rumors and conspiracy theories between 31 December 2019-30 November 2020. Sources included Google, Google Fact Check, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, fact-checking agency websites, and television and newspaper websites. Quantitative data were extracted, entered in an Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed descriptively using the statistical package R version 4.0.3. We conducted a content analysis of the qualitative information from news articles, online reports and blogs and compared with findings from quantitative data. Based on the fact-checking agency ratings, information was categorized as true, false, misleading, or exaggerated. Results: We identified 637 COVID-19 vaccine-related items: 91% were rumors and 9% were conspiracy theories from 52 countries. Of the 578 rumors, 36% were related to vaccine development, availability, and access, 20% related to morbidity and mortality, 8% to safety, efficacy, and acceptance, and the rest were other categories. Of the 637 items, 5% (30/) were true, 83% (528/637) were false, 10% (66/637) were misleading, and 2% (13/637) were exaggerated. Conclusions: Rumors and conspiracy theories may lead to mistrust contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Tracking COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in real-time and engaging with social media to disseminate correct information could help safeguard the public against misinformation."
6414,Otolaryngological symptoms in COVID-19.,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of various otolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19 with regard to age, gender and pneumonia-related thorax CT characteristics. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted between March 25, 2020 and April 25, 2020. The anamnesis and medical files of 155 patients who applied to our outpatient COVID-19 clinic were evaluated. Patients with positive PCR tests for COVID-19 who were aged between 18-72 years were divided into groups according to the presence of otolaryngological symptoms. The differences between the two groups were examined. Results: Of the 155 patients, 89 (57.4%) had otolaryngological symptoms. The mean age of the patients was 36.3 Â± 8.1 years. Ninety-one (58.7%) patients were female, and 64 (42.2%) were male. Fifty-eight (37.4%) patients had received a clinical diagnosis of viral pneumonia with ground glass findings in tomography. The frequency of otolaryngological symptoms was higher in females than males (p: 0.029). The otolaryngological symptoms were also observed to be more frequent in the 18-30 age group (p: 0.013) compared to other age groups. Conclusions: Tinnitus, gingivitis, sudden hearing loss, Bell's palsy, and hoarseness can be seen in COVID-19, albeit rarely. Revealing the otolaryngological symptoms of COVID-19, and obtaining more information about the extent of disease will be useful in managing patients and their complaints associated with otolaryngology."
6415,In Utero Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection.,Evidence for in utero transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is growing but not definitive. We present a case of neonatal infection that supports in utero transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and provides insight into the hematogenous spread from mother to fetus.
6416,Prevalence and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroprevalence among clinical and non-clinical staff in a national healthcare system.,"Background: While many studies have reported the rate and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCWs), there are scant data regarding the impact of employment type and job grades upon such risk. Methods: We determined the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) PCR among employees of a large national healthcare system. Antibody testing was performed on those who agreed to provide a blood sample. Using logistic regression analysis, we determined the risk of infection (PCR+) associated with demographic characteristics, job family and job grade. Results: We identified 35,075 staff (30,849 full-time, 4,226 outsourced) between March 1-October 31, 2020. Among full-time employees, 78.0% had a NPS (11.8% positive). Among outsourced staff, 94.4% had a NPS (31.1% positive). Antibody testing was performed on 33.9% full-time employees (13.0% reactive), and on 39.1% of the outsourced staff (47.0% reactive). PCR-positivity was higher among outsourced staff (31.0% vs. 18.3% in non-clinical and 9.0% in clinical full-time employees) and those in the low-grade vs. mid-grade and high-grade job categories. Male sex (OR 1.88), non-clinical job family (OR 1.21), low-grade job category (OR 3.71) and being an outsourced staff (OR 2.09) were associated with a higher risk of infection. Conclusion: HCWs are a diverse population with varying risk of infection. Clinical staff are at a lower risk likely due to increased awareness and infection prevention measures. Risk is higher for those in the lower socioeconomic strata. Infection is more likely to occur in non-healthcare setting than within the healthcare facilities."
6417,Recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus AdC7 expressing dimeric tandem-repeat spike protein RBD protects mice against COVID-19.,"A safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed to control the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Four adenovirus-vectored vaccines expressing spike (S) protein have been approved for use. Here, we generated several recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) vaccines expressing S, receptor-binding domain (RBD), or tandem-repeat dimeric RBD (RBD-tr2). We found vaccination via either intramuscular or intranasal route was highly immunogenic in mice to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed higher antibody responses compared to either AdC7-S or AdC7-RBD. Intranasal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 additionally induced mucosal immunity with neutralizing activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Either single-dose or two-dose mucosal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with undetectable subgenomic RNA in lung and relieved lung injury. AdC7-RBD-tr2-elicted sera preserved the neutralizing activity against the circulating variants, especially the Delta variant. These results support AdC7-RBD-tr2 as a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate."
6418,Neighborhood Social Cohesion and Inequalities in COVID-19 Diagnosis Rates by Area-Level Black/African American Racial Composition.,"Geographic inequalities in COVID-19 diagnosis are now well documented. However, we do not sufficiently know whether inequalities are related to social characteristics of communities, such as collective engagement. We tested whether neighborhood social cohesion is associated with inequalities in COVID-19 diagnosis rate and the extent the association varies across neighborhood racial composition. We calculated COVID-19 diagnosis rates in Philadelphia, PA, per 10,000 general population across 46 ZIP codes, as of April 2020. Social cohesion measures were from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey, 2018. We estimated Poisson regressions to quantify associations between social cohesion and COVID-19 diagnosis rate, testing a multiplicative interaction with Black racial composition in the neighborhood, which we operationalize via a binary indicator of ZIP codes above vs. below the city-wide average (41%) Black population. Two social cohesion indicators were significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. Associations varied across Black neighborhood racial composition (p <0.05 for the interaction test). In ZIP codes with â¥41% of Black people, higher collective engagement was associated with an 18% higher COVID-19 diagnosis rate (IRR=1.18, 95%CI=1.11, 1.26). In contrast, areas with <41% of Black people, higher engagement was associated with a 26% lower diagnosis rate (IRR=0.74, 95%CI=0.67, 0.82). Neighborhood social cohesion is associated with both higher and lower COVID-19 diagnosis rates, and the extent of associations varies across Black neighborhood racial composition. We recommend some strategies for reducing inequalities based on the segmentation model within the social cohesion and public health intervention framework."
