1280,Monitoring Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Review of Available Diagnostic Tools.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has rapidly become a global public health concern. As the new type of betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can spread across species and between populations and has a greater risk of transmission than other coronaviruses. To control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is vital to have a rapid and effective means of diagnosing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and patients with COVID-19, an early isolation protocol for infected individuals, and effective treatments for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In this review, we will summarize the novel diagnostic tools that are currently available for coronavirus, including imaging examinations and laboratory medicine by next-generation sequencing (NGS), real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis, immunoassay for COVID-19, cytokine and T cell immunoassays, biochemistry and microbiology laboratory parameters in the blood of the patients with COVID-19, and a field-effect transistor-based biosensor of COVID-19. Specifically, we will discuss the effective detection rate and assay time for the rRT-PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and the sensitivity and specificity of different antibody detection methods, such as colloidal gold and ELISA using specimen sources obtained from the respiratory tract, peripheral serum or plasma, and other bodily fluids. Such diagnostics will help scientists and clinicians develop appropriate strategies to combat COVID-19."
1281,Development of a web-based contact tracing and point-of-care-testing workflow for SARS-CoV-2 at a German University Hospital.,"Introduction: In late 2019, a novel coronavirus was detected in China. Supported by its respiratory transmissibility, even by people infected without symptomatic disease, this coronavirus soon began to rapidly spread worldwide. Background: Many countries have implemented different infection control and containment strategies due to ongoing community transmission. In this context, contact tracing as well as adequate testing and consequent quarantining of high-risk contacts play leading roles in containing the virus by interrupting infection chains. This approach is especially important in the hospital setting where contacts often cannot be avoided and physical distance is usually not possible. Furthermore, health care workers (HCWs) usually have contact with a variety of vulnerable people, making it essential to identify infections among hospital employees as soon as possible to interrupt the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the facility. Several electronic tools for contact tracing, such as specific software or mobile phone apps, are available for the public health sector. In contrast, contact tracing in hospitals often has to be carried out without helpful electronic tools, and an enormous amount of human resources is typically required. Aim: For rapid contact tracing and effective infection control and management measures for HCWs in hospitals, adapted technical solutions are needed. Methods: In this study, we report the development of our containment strategy to a web-based contact tracing and rapid point-of-care-testing workflow. Results/conclusion: Our workflow yielded efficient control of the rapidly evolving situation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic from May 2020 until January 2021 at a German University Hospital."
1282,Evaluation of a High-Definition PCR Assay for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Extracted and Nonextracted Respiratory Specimens Collected in Various Transport Media.,"Objectives: We conducted an analytic and clinical comparison of a novel high-definition polymerase chain reaction PCR (HDPCR) assay to traditional real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in upper respiratory specimens. Methods: Analytic performance of RT-PCR, HDPCR, and extraction-free HDPCR was established through replicate testing of a serially diluted clinical specimen containing SARS-CoV-2. A clinical comparison of all 3 assays was conducted using 351 prospectively collected upper respiratory swab specimens obtained from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals collected in various transport media. Results: RT-PCR and HDPCR assays using extracted nucleic acid demonstrated similar analytic limits of detection (LoD) and clinical performance, with 100% positive and negative agreement. Extraction-free HDPCR demonstrated a 1.5 to 2.0 log10 increase in LoD based on cycle threshold values. However, clinical performance of extraction-free HDPCR remained high, demonstrating 97.8% positive and 99.6% negative agreement with RT-PCR. An overall increase in ""invalid"" and ""presumptive"" results was observed when using the extraction-free method, but this was highly variable based on transport medium used. Conclusions: HDPCR performs similar to RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of an extraction-free HDPCR protocol maintained high clinical performance despite reduced analytic LoD, with the benefit of reduced hands-on time and cost of reagents associated with nucleic acid extraction."
1283,Effectiveness of Messenger RNA Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccines Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in a Cohort of Healthcare Personnel.,"In a large cohort of United States healthcare personnel without prior coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, 94 382 doses of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine were administered to 49 220 individuals. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness following 2 doses of each of the 2 available brands of mRNA vaccine exceeded 96%."
1284,SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: Lights and shadows.,"Vaccines to prevent acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection elicit an immune neutralizing response. Some concerns have been raised regarding the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, largely based on case-reports of serious thromboembolic events after vaccination. Some mechanisms have been suggested which might explain the adverse cardiovascular reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Different vaccine platforms are currently available which include live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, vector vaccines, DNA vaccines and RNA vaccines. Vaccines increase the endogenous synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from a variety of cells. Once synthetized, the Spike proteins assembled in the cytoplasma migrate to the cell surface and protrude with a native-like conformation. These proteins are recognized by the immune system which rapidly develops an immune response. Such response appears to be quite vigorous in the presence of DNA vaccines which encode viral vectors, as well as in subjects who are immunized because of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The resulting pathological features may resemble those of active coronavirus disease. The free-floating Spike proteins synthetized by cells targeted by vaccine and destroyed by the immune response circulate in the blood and systematically interact with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed by a variety of cells including platelets, thereby promoting ACE2 internalization and degradation. These reactions may ultimately lead to platelet aggregation, thrombosis and inflammation mediated by several mechanisms including platelet ACE2 receptors. Whereas Phase III vaccine trials generally excluded participants with previous immunization, vaccination of huge populations in the real life will inevitably include individuals with preexisting immunity. This might lead to excessively enhanced inflammatory and thrombotic reactions in occasional subjects. Further research is urgently needed in this area."
1285,Efficacy and safety of ReDuNing injection as a treatment for COVID-19 and its inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: Although the rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a considerable threat to global public health, no specific treatment is available for COVID-19. ReDuNing injection (RDN) is a traditional Chinese medicine known to exert antibacterial, antiviral, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, RDN has been recommended in the diagnosis and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated pneumonia by the National Health Council and the National Administration of Chinese Medicine. However, there is no information regarding its efficacy against COVID-19. Aim of study: This study was designed to determine the clinical efficacy of RDN in patients with COVID-19 and characterize its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Materials and methods: A total of 50 adults with COVID-19 were included in this study, and the primary endpoint was recovery from clinical symptoms following 14 days of treatment. General improvements were defined as the disappearance of the major symptoms of infection including fever, fatigue, and cough. The secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who achieved clinical symptom amelioration on days 7 and 10, time to clinical recovery, time to a negative nucleic acid test result, duration of hospitalization, and time to defervescence. Plaque reduction and cytopathic effect assays were also performed in vitro, and reverse-transcription quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IP-10, MCP-1, IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-2 and CCL-5) during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The RDN group exhibited a shorter median time for the resolution of clinical symptoms (120 vs. 220 h, P < 0.0001), less time to a negative PCR test result (215 vs. 310 h, P = 0.0017), shorter hospitalization (14.8 vs. 18.5 days, P = 0.0002), and lower timeframe for defervescence (24.5 vs. 75 h, P = 0.0001) than the control group. In addition, time to improved imaging was also shorter in the RDN group than in the control group (6 vs.8.9 days, P = 0.0273); symptom resolution rates were higher in the RDN group than in the control group at 7 (96.30% vs. 39.13%, P < 0.0001) and 10 days (96.30% vs. 56.52%, P = 0.0008). No allergic reactions or anaphylactic responses were reported in this trial. RDN markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 proliferation and viral plaque formation in vitro. In addition, RDN significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine production in infected cells. Conclusions: RDN relieves clinical symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection by regulating inflammatory cytokine-related disorders, suggestion that this medication might be a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19."
1286,Vaccine Considerations for Multiple Sclerosis in the COVID-19 Era.,"People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at risk for infections that can result in amplification of baseline symptoms and possibly trigger clinical relapses. Vaccination can prevent infection through the activation of humoral and cellular immune responses. This is particularly pertinent in the era of emerging novel vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which affect the immune system, may impact immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines in people with MS. The objective of this article is to provide information on immune system responses to vaccinations and review previous studies of vaccine responses in people with MS to support the safety and importance of receiving currently available and emerging COVID-19 vaccines. Immunological studies have shown that coordinated interactions between T and B lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system are key to successful generation of immunological memory and production of neutralizing antibodies following recognition of vaccine antigens by innate immune cells. CD4+ T cells are essential to facilitate CD8+ T cell and B cell activation, while B cells drive and sustain T cell memory. Data suggest that some classes of DMT, including type 1 interferons and glatiramer acetate, may not significantly impair the response to vaccination. DMTs-such as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, which sequester lymphocytes from circulation; alemtuzumab; and anti-CD20 therapies, which rely on depleting populations of immune cells-have been shown to attenuate responses to conventional vaccines. Currently, three COVID-19 vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization in the USA on the basis of promising interim findings of ongoing trials. Because analyses of these vaccines in people with MS are not available, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccination and DMT choice should be informed by data and expert consensus, and personalized with considerations for disease burden, risk of infection, and other factors."
1287,Poor maternal-neonatal outcomes in pregnant patients with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection: analysis of 145 cases.,"Purpose: The coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently spread causing millions of individuals affected globally. The raising mortality rate highlighted the necessity to identify the most susceptible populations, such as pregnant women and their fetuses, in order to protect them. Few studies have been conducted trying to identify maternal-neonatal outcomes among pregnant patients affected by COVID 19. In this scenario, this study aims to analyse poor maternal-neonatal outcomes in pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: This was a double-centre, 5 months retrospective analysis conducted in Italy. The study population consisted of pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed by Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: 145 pregnant women affected by confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Among them, 116 (80%) were symptomatic and 29 (20%) were asymptomatic. Up to half of the patients (n = 111; 76.5%) had a past history of respiratory disease. The mean gestational age at delivery was 36 weeks ± 5 days, while the mean maternal age was 31.5 ± 5.63. Reactive C protein (CRP) serum levels were higher than the normal range corresponding to a mean value of 56.93 ± 49.57 mg/L. The mean interval between the diagnosis of maternal COVID-19 infection and the delivery was 8.5 days. With regard to the type of delivery, the percentage of patients who delivered vaginally was higher than those who experienced a caesarean section. (74.4% vs 25.6%). The percentage of term birth was higher than preterm one (62% vs 38%). Finally, the percentages of maternal and neonatal death were found to be 5% and 6%, respectively; similarly, the percentage of the infection vertical transmission was 5%. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection in pregnant women seems to negatively affect both maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, it is important to emphasize that most of the cases of maternal death occurred in patients with severe symptoms and highly altered parameters related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the future, larger studies are warranted in order to validate these findings."
1288,Multiplex real-time PCR using double-strand primers and probes for the detection of nucleic acids.,"Multiplex PCR encounters difficulties in primer designing with all the primer pairs working at the same annealing temperature. In this study, we have developed a double-strand primer-mediated multiple strand displacement reaction for the detection of SARS-COV-2 ORF, N and E genes (as examples). The double primer is composed of a 5'-modified fluorophore strand, which does not impact polymerase extension and a 3'-modified quencher strand, which cannot impact elongation. At the annealing temperature, the fluorophore strand combined with the template, extended and resulted in fluorescence signal release. Results showed that the double-strand primer relatively exhibits a wide annealing temperature range and good compatibility between three pairs of primers and probes. These merits allow the simple and multiplex real-time fluorescence quantification of nucleic acids. The detection limit was 400 copies/mL, and the detection time was approximately 2 h. In addition to its extreme specificity and simplicity, this method has a wide range of applications such as multiple PCR and SNP detection."
1289,Management of Neurosurgical Cases in a Tertiary Care Referral Hospital During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons from a Middle-Income Country.,"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been at its peak for the past 8 months and has affected more than 215 countries around the world. India is now the second most-affected nation with more than 48,000,000 cases and 79,000 deaths. Despite this, and the fact that it is a lower-middle-income nation, the number of deaths is almost one third that of the United States and one half that of Brazil. However, there has been no experience published from non-COVID-19-designated hospitals, where the aim is to manage noninfected cases with neurosurgical ailments while keeping the number of infected cases to a minimum. Methods: We analyzed the number of neurosurgical cases (nontrauma) done in the past 5 months (March-July 2020) in our institute, which is the largest neurosurgical center by volume in southern India, and compared the same to the concurrent 5 months in 2019 and 5 months preceding the pandemic. We also reviewed the total number of cases infected with COVID-19 managed during this time. Results: We operated a total of 630 cases (nontrauma) in these 5 months and had 9 COVID-19 infected cases operated during this time. There was a 57% (P = 0.002) reduction in the number of cases operated as compared with the same 5 months in the preceding year. We employed a dual strategy of rapid antigen testing and surgery for cases needing emergency intervention and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test for elective cases. The hospital was divided into 3 zones (red, orange, and green) depending on infectivity level with minimal interaction. Separate teams were designated for each zone, and thus we were able to effectively manage even infected cases despite the absence of pulmonology/medical specialists. Conclusions: We present a patient management protocol for non-COVID-19-designated hospitals in high-volume centers with the constraints of a lower-middle-income nation and demonstrate its effectiveness. Strict zoning targeted testing and effective triage can help in management during the pandemic."
