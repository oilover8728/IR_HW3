9261,Direct Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Analytical Limits of Detection across Seven Molecular Assays.,"Analytical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection is a key performance metric for the evaluation of viral detection assays. We determined analytical limits of detection for seven SARS-CoV-2 assays using serial dilutions of pooled patient material quantified with droplet digital PCR. Limits of detection ranged from â‰¤10 to 74 copies/ml for commercial high-throughput laboratory analyzers (Roche Cobas, Abbott m2000, and Hologic Panther Fusion) and 167 to 511 copies/ml for sample-to-answer (DiaSorin Simplexa, GenMark ePlex) and point-of-care instruments (Abbott ID NOW). The CDC assay yielded limits of detection ranging from 85 to 499 copies/ml, depending on the extraction method and thermocycler used. These results can help to inform the assay choice for testing approaches to manage the current COVID-19 outbreak."
9262,[Treatment strategy of gastrointestinal stromal tumors in the background of COVID-19].,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-COV-2, has the characteristics of world epidemic, highly infectious and large base of death. In China, transmission route of SARS-COV-2 has been contained so effectively that COVID-19 has been well controlled due to the proactive national prevention and control strategy. However, not only does it bring a huge impact on the existing medical structure model, but also an objective impact on the treatment of patients with chronic diseases such as malignant tumors. Based on the progress reported in the domestic and international literatures and the actual management experience of our team, this paper reflects on the treatment strategies for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) during the epidemic period of COVID-19. We focus on risk stratification for primary GIST and forming treatment strategies accordingly. Major considerations include the impact of delayed operation, the burden of medical resources, the waiting time for elective operation, and the principle of emergency operation. In addition, we focus on the level of evidence for non-surgical approaches with a view to developing a holistic strategy of ""priority management principles"" to guide clinical treatment in the context of limited resources and different GIST priorities."
9263,Patient Characteristics and Subsequent Health Care Use by Location of SARS-CoV-2 Testing Initiation in a Safety-Net Health System.,This cross-sectional study examines patterns in entry location for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a safety-net health system by patient demographic characteristics.
9264,A haemagglutination test for rapid detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.,"Serological detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential for establishing rates of seroconversion in populations, and for seeking evidence for a level of antibody that may be protective against COVID-19 disease. Several high-performance commercial tests have been described, but these require centralised laboratory facilities that are comparatively expensive, and therefore not available universally. Red cell agglutination tests do not require special equipment, are read by eye, have short development times, low cost and can be applied at the Point of Care. Here we describe a quantitative Haemagglutination test (HAT) for the detection of antibodies to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The HAT has a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 99% for detection of antibodies after a PCR diagnosed infection. We will supply aliquots of the test reagent sufficient for ten thousand test wells free of charge to qualified research groups anywhere in the world."

9266,The m(6)A methylome of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells.,"The newly identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global health emergency because of its rapid spread and high mortality. The molecular mechanism of interaction between host and viral genomic RNA is yet unclear. We demonstrate herein that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, as well as the negative-sense RNA, is dynamically N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified in human and monkey cells. Combined RIP-seq and miCLIP analyses identified a total of 8 m6A sites at single-base resolution in the genome. Especially, epidemic strains with mutations at these identified m6A sites have emerged worldwide, and formed a unique cluster in the US as indicated by phylogenetic analysis. Further functional experiments showed that m6A methylation negatively regulates SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection also triggered a global increase in host m6A methylome, exhibiting altered localization and motifs of m6A methylation in mRNAs. Altogether, our results identify m6A as a dynamic epitranscriptomic mark mediating the virus-host interaction."
9267,A Founder Effect Led Early SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Spain.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) whole-genome analysis has identified five large clades worldwide which emerged in 2019 (19A and 19B) and in 2020 (20A, 20B, and 20C). This study aimed to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated to have emerged in Wuhan, China, around 24 November 2019. Phylogenetic analyses of the first 12,511 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences obtained worldwide, including 290 from 11 different regions of Spain, revealed 62 independent introductions of the virus in the country. Most sequences from Spain were distributed in clades characterized by a D614G substitution in the S gene (20A, 20B, and 20C) and an L84S substitution in ORF8 (19B) with 163 and 118 sequences, respectively, with the remaining sequences branching in 19A. A total of 110 (38%) sequences from Spain grouped in four different monophyletic clusters of clade 20A (20A-Sp1 and 20A-Sp2) and 19B clade (19B-Sp1 and 19B-Sp2) along with sequences from 29 countries worldwide. The MRCAs of clusters 19A-Sp1, 20A-Sp1, 19A-Sp2, and 20A-Sp2 were estimated to have occurred in Spain around 21 and 29 January and 6 and 17 February 2020, respectively. The prevalence of clade 19B in Spain (40%) was by far higher than in any other European country during the first weeks of the epidemic, probably as a result of a founder effect. However, this variant was replaced by G614-bearing viruses in April. In vitro assays showed an enhanced infectivity of pseudotyped virions displaying the G614 substitution compared with those having D614, suggesting a fitness advantage of D614G.IMPORTANCE Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain, and at least four resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters that originated not later than mid-February, with further dissemination to many other countries around the world, and a few weeks before the explosion of COVID-19 cases detected in Spain during the first week of March. The majority of the earliest variants detected in Spain branched in the clade 19B (D614 viruses), which was the most prevalent clade during the first weeks of March, pointing to a founder effect. However, from mid-March to June 2020, G614-bearing viruses (clades 20A, 20B, and 20C) overcame D614 variants in Spain, probably as a consequence of an evolutionary advantage of this substitution in the spike protein. A higher infectivity of G614-bearing viruses than D614 variants was detected, suggesting that this substitution in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be behind the variant shift observed in Spain."
9268,Outbreak of SARS-CoV2: Pathogenesis of infection and cardiovascular involvement.,"Since the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has emerged from China, the infection (novel corona virus disease-2019, COVID-19) has affected many countries and led to many deaths worldwide. Like SARS-CoV, angiotencin converting enzyme (ACE)2 as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV2 is essential for the virus to make an entry into the cell. ACE2 is a part of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, which is expressed in several organs that opposes the angiotensin (Ang) II functions by converting Ang II to Ang (1-7), the one with vasodilation effects. The death rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be approximately 3.4%; however, some comorbid conditions like underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes increase the risk of mortality. In addition, cardiovascular involvement as a complication of SARS-CoV2 could be direct through either ACE2 receptors that are expressed tremendously in the heart, or by the surge of different cytokines or by acute respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia. Traditional risk factors could aggravate the process of COVID-19 infection that urges the triage of these high-risk patients for SARS-CoV2. Currently, there is no effective, proven treatment or vaccination for COVID-19, but many investigators are struggling to find a treatment strategy as soon as possible. Some potential medications like chloroquine by itself or in combination with azithromycin and some protease inhibitors used for the treatment of COVID-19 have cardiovascular adverse effects, which should be kept in mind while the patients taking these medications are being closely monitored."
9269,COVID-19 vaccination: The impact on the selection criteria of the convalescent plasma donors.,"Clinical management protocols for COVID-19 are evolving rapidly as more information about the epidemiology and pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 become available. However, no definite treatment of COVID-19 has been found till date. The COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) therapy has emerged as an important investigational therapy in the management of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the regulatory agencies, in particular, the Indian blood transfusion council must release some interim recommendations for the blood centres on the CCP blood donor eligibility criteria after COVID-19 vaccination. More clinical trials are needed to know the efficacy of the CCP harvested from COVID-19 recovered individuals who have been vaccinated against those COVID-19 recovered individuals who are not vaccinated to understand the vaccine impact on the IgG titres of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies."
