6190,COVID Arm: Delayed Hypersensitivity Reactions to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines Misdiagnosed as Cellulitis.,"The term ""COVID arm"" has been coined to describe a harmless delayed hypersensitivity reaction occurring approximately a week after administration of the novel SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. It appears as a red, warm, pruritic, indurated, or swollen area in the vicinity of the vaccine site. These reactions, especially if accompanied by systemic symptoms, have been mistaken for cellulitis. We report 3 cases of COVID arm, 2 of which were mistaken for cellulitis. Distinguishing features of COVID arm from cellulitis include pruritus as a common finding, occurrence approximately a week after vaccination, a lack of progression of symptoms, rapid response to topical steroids, and/or spontaneous resolution usually over 4 to 5 days.Practice Points:• Patients receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may experience delayed hypersensitivity reactions characterized by erythema, swelling, and itching occurring near the vaccination site (COVID arm), approximately a week after vaccination.• Clinicians can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 vaccine reactions from cellulitis by the time of onset (approximately a week vs 5 days), by the lack of progression of symptoms, and resolution over 4 to 5 days.• Severe cases of COVID arm may be treated with topical steroids."
6191,Differences in the Concentration of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies Post-COVID-19 Recovery or Post-Vaccination.,"At the end of 2020, population-based vaccination programs with new generation mRNA-based vaccines began almost all over the world. The aim of the study was to evaluate the titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against the S1 subunit of the virus's spike protein as a marker of the humoral response in 477 patients and the concentration of interferon-gamma as an indicator of cellular response in 28 individuals. In our studies, we used serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. IgG was measured in weeks 2 and 3 after the first dose and 1-5 weeks after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine in seropositive and seronegative individuals as well as in symptomatic and asymptomatic convalescents. High levels of antibodies were observed in 98% of our vaccinated cohort, and the presence of protective T cells was confirmed in the blood samples of all participants. The humoral immune response is diversified and is visible as early as 2-3 weeks after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine. The level of protection increased significantly after the second dose, with the increase being much greater in pre-vaccine healthy subjects and less in convalescents. In the second and third weeks after the second dose, the concentration of IgG antibodies was the highest, and in the following weeks, it decreased gradually. Regular serological measurements on eight subjects show that antibody titers are lower four months after vaccination than before the second dose."

6194,Coronavirus disease 2019 in renal transplant recipients: Report of two cases.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a pandemic worldwide. The data about COVID-19 in renal transplant recipient are deficiency. Herein, we report two COVID-19 cases in renal transplant recipients. Both cases were discharged following a treatment regimen including discontinued immunosuppressant and low-dose methylprednisolone-based therapy. There were no signs of rejection during the treatment. These successfully treated cases can provide helpful information about the management of COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients."
6195,Broad-based SARS-CoV-2 testing program for healthcare workers in a primary care hospital in France.,"A broad-based SARS-CoV-2 testing program for all symptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) was implemented in Tenon hospital, Paris, France. From February 26 to April 22, 2020, 701 symptomatic HCWs were screened, of whom 247 (35.2%) tested positive for SARS-Cov-2. Myalgia, fever, anosmia and ageusia were associated with RT-PCR positivity. Testing of HCWs is an essential step toward control of the epidemic. Further studies could establish clinical algorithms for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis to compensate for RT-PCR test and chest CT limits or unavailability."
6196,"The Three Steps Needed to End the COVID-19 Pandemic: Bold Public Health Leadership, Rapid Innovations, and Courageous Political Will.","The world is experiencing the expansive spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a global pandemic that is placing strain on health care, economic, and social systems. Commitment to implementing proven public health strategies will require bold public health leadership and courageous acts by politicians. Developing new innovative communication, mitigation, and health care approaches, particularly in the era of social media, is also clearly warranted. We believe that the best public health evidence must inform activities in three priority areas to stop this pandemic: (1) coordinated and consistent stay-at-home orders across multiple jurisdictions, including potential nationwide mandates; (2) rapid scale-up of SARS-CoV-2 testing; and (3) improved health care capacity to respond. This editorial outlines those areas, the rationale behind them, and the call for innovation and engagement of bold public health leadership to empower courageous political action to reduce the number of deaths during this pandemic."
6197,The willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and affecting factors among healthcare professionals: A cross-sectional study in Turkey.,"Introduction: While discussions on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines continue, healthcare professionals' attitudes and their growing fear and anxiety during the pandemic process are not yet fully known. In this study, we aimed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and affecting factors in healthcare professionals. Methods: This was a cross-sectional online survey conducted in 1574 healthcare professionals consisting of physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, and healthcare personnel in Turkey in December 2020. Demographic, attitudinal, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale scores of healthcare professionals were investigated in this survey. Results: About 84.6% of healthcare professionals declared willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine whenever possible. Most physicians (90.4%) stated to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, while 66.5% of nurses, 73.9% of healthcare personnel, also preferred to have it as soon as the vaccine was available. Factors affecting the willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were found to be advanced age, male gender, working in a primary health care center, living with family, having a child, having a chronic disease, having high Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FC-19S) scores. While the group with the highest vaccine rejection rate was nurses with 33.5%, FC-19S scores were significantly higher in nurses who wanted to be vaccinated. In multivariate regression analyses, factors related to the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine were identified as advanced age, routine adult vaccination, no history of COVID-19, and recommendation of the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: A high proportion of healthcare professionals declared their willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, and hence, this will play a leading role in optimizing the vaccination rate of the entire population while combating the pandemic."
6198,Accumulated Clinical Experiences from Successful Treatment of 1377 Severe and Critically Ill COVID-19 Cases.,"In late December 2019, COVID-19 was firstly recognized in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly to all of the provinces of China. The West Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital, the designated hospital to admit and treat the severe and critically ill COVID-19 cases, has treated a large number of such patients with great success and obtained lots of valuable experiences based on the Chinese guideline (V7.0). To standardize and share the treatment procedures of severe and critically ill cases, Wuhan Union Hospital has established a working group and formulated an operational recommendation, including the monitoring, early warning indicators, and several treatment principles for severe and critically ill cases. The treatment experiences may provide some constructive suggestions for treating the severe and critically ill COVID-19 cases all over the world."
6199,A case report of COVID-19 with false negative RT-PCR test: necessity of chest CT.,"The definite diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on the viral isolation or positive result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from sputum, or nasal swab, or throat swab. However, the sensitivity to detect COVID-19 of real time (RT)-PCR is reported to be lower than that of chest CT. We report a case of 34-year-old man who was diagnosed as negative for COVID-19 based on the four sequential RT-PCR tests of his pharyngeal swab. Chest CT showed patchy ground-glass opacity on admission, and it rapidly progressed to segmental mixed consolidation and ground-glass opacity 3 days after admission, and it resolved in left upper lobe, but showed multifocal ground-glass opacities 7 days after admission, and they resolved within 2 weeks. The fifth RT-PCR test finally revealed positive results at the fifth day after admission. It is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia on CT findings alone; however, we emphasize the utility of chest CT to detect early change of COVID-19 in cases which RT-PCR tests show negative results."
