2830,Recommendations for the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of VITT against COVID-19: Communication from the ISTH SSC Subcommittee on Platelet Immunology.,"Vaccine administration is under way worldwide to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic. The newly developed vaccines are highly effective with minimal adverse effects. Recently, the AstraZeneca ChadOx1 nCov-19 vaccine has raised public alarm with concerns regarding the rare, but serious, development of thrombotic events, now known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). These thrombotic events appear similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, both clinically and pathologically. In this manuscript, the ISTH SSC Subcommittee on Platelet Immunology outlines guidelines on how to recognize, diagnose and manage patients with VITT."
2831,Comparative research on nucleocapsid and spike glycoprotein as the rapid immunodetection targets of COVID-19 and establishment of immunoassay strips.,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) poses a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the outbreak of COVID-19 has been a pandemic that infected more than 25.32 million people and caused more than 848.25 thousand deaths worldwide at the time of 1st September 2020. Despite governmental initiatives aimed to contain the spread of the disease, several countries are experiencing unmanageable increases in medical equipment and larger testing capacity. The current diagnosis based on nuclear acid requires specialized instruments, time-consuming, and laborious, the low-cost and convenient technologies were still urgently needed. Both spike and nucleocapsid are key structural proteins of COVID-19 with good immunogenicity, can serve as primary targets for immunoassay. After comparative research, we certified nucleocapsid antigen-monoclonal antibody (mAbs) system was more suitable for the COVID-19 immunodetection. Subsequently, we designed a rapid test strip based on it that can be used in large-scale screening of COVID-19 in population and more suitable for some remote and special needs areas were restricted by a medical condition or for quick and large quantities of screenings."
2832,"Nasopharyngeal and Oropharyngeal Swabs, And/Or Serology for SARS COVID-19: What Are We Looking For?","Governments and clinicians that were fully involved in the dramatic SARS-CoV-2 outbreak during the last few weeks in Italy (and more or less all over the world) are fiercely debating the use of methods for screening this viral infection. Thus, all countries are employing a lot of resources in order to test more and more subjects. For this purpose, there are different strategies, based on either direct or indirect tests. Among the first category, the main assays used for SARS-CoV-2 are based on a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Such tests can be performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for the categories of those with symptoms and those potentially exposed. In order to integrate the molecular assays in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, a wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed. If we want to identify ""immune"" people in order to let them to come back to work, serology is the best (and probably the only) approach."
2833,Ongoing Challenges Faced in the Global Control of COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now spread worldwide and caused more than 51,000 deaths, by April 2nd 2020. As predicted, there are several obstacles for medical and governmental authorities to efficiently manage this respiratory illness. In spite of appropriated supplies, most hospitals are suffering from a scarcity of free beds, protective masks, sanitizing liquids and even ECMO machines for patients with severe cases. Defeating this pandemic is impossible without united and coordinated international attempts shaped by all countries of the world. We believe that an international scaled-determination is required to diminish the complex impacts of pandemic. The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic. In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations."
2834,Optimization of COVID-19 testing accuracy with nasal anatomy education.,"Importance: Adequate sampling of the nasopharynx is crucial to performing accurate SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) testing. Formalized education of nasal anatomy may improve provider testing technique and reduce false-negative test results. Objective: To assess the effect of nasal anatomy education on medical providers' comfort level and knowledge base in performing accurate SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) testing. Study design: Pre-post survey. Settings: Tertiary care academic hospital. Participants: 17 nurses performing COVID testing were enrolled. Intervention: An educational session on COVID nasopharyngeal testing technique and nasal anatomy was presented by an otolaryngologist. Main outcomes and measures: A pre-session survey assessed providers' prior nasal testing training and COVID testing challenges. Provider comfort level with COVID testing was surveyed pre-and post-session. A 6-question nasal anatomy test was administered pre- and post-session. Results: 16 out of 17 nurses performed fewer than 10 COVID tests prior to the educational session (94%). Reported challenges with COVID testing included patient discomfort (79.6%), inability to pass the test swab (23.5%) and nasal bleeding (11.8%). The number of providers comfortable with independently performing COVID testing increased from pre- to post-session (5 and 14, p = 0.013). The average number of correct responses to the 6-question nasal anatomy test increased following the session (3.2 ± 1.2 to 5.1 ± 1.1, p = 0.003). Specifically, the number of providers able to localize the nasopharynx increased from 8 providers pre-session to 14 providers post-session (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Early implementation of nasal anatomy and nasopharyngeal swab technique education can help improve provider comfort and knowledge in performing accurate COVID testing."

2836,"Rapid establishment of laboratory diagnostics for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Bavaria, Germany, February 2020.","The need for timely establishment of diagnostic assays arose when Germany was confronted with the first travel-associated outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Europe. We describe our laboratory experiences during a large contact tracing investigation, comparing previously published real-time RT-PCR assays in different PCR systems and a commercial kit. We found that assay performance using the same primers and probes with different PCR systems varied and the commercial kit performed well."

2838,Residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal swabs of convalescent COVID-19 patients: Is prolonged quarantine always justified?,"Real-time reverse transcription PCR is currently the most sensitive method to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Defining whether a patient could be contagious or not contagious in the presence of residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA is of extreme importance in the context of public health. In this prospective multicenter study, virus isolation was prospectively attempted in 387 nasal swabs from clinically recovered patients showing low viral load (quantification cycle, Cq, value greater than 30). The median Cq value was 36.8 (range 30.0-39.4). Overall, a cytopathic effect was detected in nine samples, corresponding to a culture positivity rate of 2.3% (9/387). The results of this study help to dissect true virus replication and residual viral RNA detection in recovered patients."
2839,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using a vesicular stomatitis virus possessing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and is now classified in the genus Coronavirus with closely related SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in humans and is classified as a biosafety level (BSL)-3 pathogen, which makes manipulating it relatively difficult due to its infectious nature. Methods: To circumvent the need for BSL-3 laboratories, an alternative assay was developed that avoids live virus and instead uses a recombinant VSV expressing luciferase and possesses the full length or truncated spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, to measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies under BSL2 conditions, a chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT) for SARS-CoV-2 was developed. The neutralization values of the serum samples collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative donors against the pseudotyped virus infection evaluated by the CRNT were compared with antibody titers determined from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Results: The CRNT, which used whole blood collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was also examined. As a result, the inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection was specifically observed in both serum and whole blood and was also correlated with the results of the IFA. Conclusions: In conclusion, the CRNT for COVID-19 is a convenient assay system that can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory with high specificity and sensitivity for evaluating the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2."
