7940,Graphene Sheets with Defined Dual Functionalities for the Strong SARS-CoV-2 Interactions.,"Search of new strategies for the inhibition of respiratory viruses is one of the urgent health challenges worldwide, as most of the current therapeutic agents and treatments are inefficient. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic and has taken lives of approximately two million people to date. Even though various vaccines are currently under development, virus, and especially its spike glycoprotein can mutate, which highlights a need for a broad-spectrum inhibitor. In this work, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by graphene platforms with precise dual sulfate/alkyl functionalities is investigated. A series of graphene derivatives with different lengths of aliphatic chains is synthesized and is investigated for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and feline coronavirus. Graphene derivatives with long alkyl chains (>C9) inhibit coronavirus replication by virtue of disrupting viral envelope. The ability of these graphene platforms to rupture viruses is visualized by atomic force microscopy and cryogenic electron microscopy. A large concentration window (10 to 100-fold) where graphene platforms display strongly antiviral activity against native SARS-CoV-2 without significant toxicity against human cells is found. In this concentration range, the synthesized graphene platforms inhibit the infection of enveloped viruses efficiently, opening new therapeutic and metaphylactic avenues against SARS-CoV-2."
7941,A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 genomic analysis identifies potential targets for drug repurposing.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is a novel human coronavirus strain (HCoV) was initially reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. This acute infection caused pneumonia-like symptoms and other respiratory tract illness. Its higher transmission and infection rate has successfully enabled it to have a global spread over a matter of small time. One of the major concerns involving the SARS-COV-2 is the mutation rate, which enhances the virus evolution and genome variability, thereby making the design of therapeutics difficult. In this study, we identified the most common haplotypes from the haplotype network. The conserved genes and population level variants were analysed. Non-Structural Protein 10 (NSP10), Nucleoprotein, Papain-like protease (Plpro or NSP3) and 3-Chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro or NSP5), which were conserved at the highest threshold, were used as drug targets for molecular dynamics simulations. Darifenacin, Nebivolol, Bictegravir, Alvimopan and Irbesartan are among the potential drugs, which are suggested for further pre-clinical and clinical trials. This particular study provides a comprehensive targeting of the conserved genes. We also identified the mutation frequencies across the viral genome."
7942,NOX2 Activation in COVID-19: Possible Implications for Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading contagious infectious disease caused by the pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that primarily affects the respiratory tract as well as the central nervous system (CNS). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through the interaction of the viral protein Spike with the angiotensin II receptor (ACE 2), leading to an increase of angiotensin II and activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase2 (NOX2), resulting in the release of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory molecules. The purpose of the review is to explain that SARS-CoV-2 infection can determine neuroinflammation that induces NOX2 activation in microglia. To better understand the role of NOX2 in inflammation, an overview of its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is provided. To write this manuscript, we performed a PubMed search to evaluate the possible relationship of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NOX2 activation in microglia, as well as the role of NOX2 in NDs. Several studies highlighted that NOX2 activation in microglia amplifies neuroinflammation. To date, there is no clinical treatment capable of counteracting its activation, however, NOX2 could be a promising pharmaceutical target useful for both the treatment and prevention of NDs and COVID-19 treatment."
7943,Potential drug development and therapeutic approaches for clinical intervention in COVID-19.,"While the vaccination is now available to many countries and will slowly dissipate to others, effective therapeutics for COVID-19 is still illusive. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has posed an unprecedented challenge to researchers, scientists, and clinicians and affected the wellbeing of millions of people worldwide. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a multitude of existing anti-viral, antibiotic, antimalarial, and anticancer drugs have been tested, and some have shown potency in the treatment and management of COVID-19, albeit others failed to leave any positive impact and a few also became controversial as they showed mixed clinical outcomes. In the present article, we have brought together some of the candidate therapeutic drugs being repurposed or used in the clinical trials and discussed their clinical efficacy and safety for COVID-19."

7948,Inhibition of N-linked Glycosylation by Tunicamycin May Contribute to The Treatment of SARS-CoV-2.,"SARS-CoV-2 remains a medical and economic challenge, due to the lack of a suitable drug or vaccine. The glycans in some proteins play a pivotal role in protein folding, oligomerization, quality control, sorting, and transport so the hindering of N-linked glycosylation of glycoproteins will prevent assembly of the virion. Tunicamycin an anticancer drug inhibit the N- linked glycans. Our study aimed to find out the mechanism action of tunicamycin on the viral glycoproteins. The growth of coronavirus in the presence inhibitor tunicamycin resulted in the production of spikeless, non-infectious virions which were devoid of S protein. We concluded that tunicamycin inhibits E2, S, and M glycoproteins of coronaviruses. Tunicamycin is also diminished glycosylation of PTMs such as HE, and 8 ab of SARS-CoV. Finally, we recommend using this drug to treat the SARS-CoV-2."
7949,Entropy based analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spread in India using informative subtype markers.,"India became one of the most COVID-19 affected countries with more than 4 million infected cases and 71,000 deaths by September 2020. We studied the temporal dynamics and geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 subtypes in India. Moreover, we analysed the RGD motif and D614G mutation in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We used a previously proposed viral subtyping method based upon informative subtype markers (ISMs). The ISMs were identified on the basis of information entropy using 94,515 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available publicly at the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). We identified 11 distinct positions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes for defining ISMs resulting in 798 unique ISMs. The most abundant ISM in India was transferred from European countries. In contrast, the second most abundant ISM in India was found to be transferred via Australia. Moreover, the eastern regions in India were infected by the ISM most abundant in China due to geographical linkage. Our analysis confirmed higher rates of new cases in the countries abundant with S-G614 strain compared to countries with abundant S-D614 strain. In India, overall S-G614 was most prevalent compared to S-D614, except a few regions including New Delhi, Bihar, and Rajasthan."
