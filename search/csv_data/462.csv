4611,The impacts of viral inactivating methods on quantitative RT-PCR for COVID-19.,"Objective: This paper aims to explore the effect of four virus inactivation methods on the rapid detection results of COVID-19 nucleic acid. Methods: Collected samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing City, each of sample was divided into 5 groups (groupA∼E): A:Non-inactivated raw sample; B:75 % ethanol inactivation; C:56 ℃ incubation for 30 min inactivation; D:65 ℃ incubation for 10 min inactivation; E:Pre-inactivation using RNA virus special preservation fluid added into the sampling tube to treated the nasopharyngeal swab sample separately, using real-time fluorescent RT-PCR to detect the N gene of COVID-19 and the ORF1ab gene simultaneously. All the groups are diluted in 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 ratios. The objectives are to compare the effect of the varied inactivation method on CT(Cycle Threshold)results in PCR, conduct correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: For the N gene and ORF1ab gene, the CT values of 4 inactivated and Non-inactivated treatment were correlated (P＜0.001). The results of the four treatment methods and specimens without inactivated treatment have shown good consistency. Conclusion: The treatment of nasopharyngeal swab specimens using mentioned four inactivated methods had no significant effect on the subsequent detection of the new COVID-19 nucleic acid test. Lab test-persons can flexibly adopt pre-inactivation methods to ensure the accuracy of virus nucleic acid test results, meanwhile guarantee the safety of lab test-persons."
4612,"Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial.","Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic warrants accelerated efforts to test vaccine candidates. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidate, BBIBP-CorV, in humans. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial at Shangqiu City Liangyuan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Henan Province, China. In phase 1, healthy people aged 18-80 years, who were negative for serum-specific IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at the time of screening, were separated into two age groups (18-59 years and ≥60 years) and randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo in a two-dose schedule of 2 μg, 4 μg, or 8 μg on days 0 and 28. In phase 2, healthy adults (aged 18-59 years) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive vaccine or placebo on a single-dose schedule of 8 μg on day 0 or on a two-dose schedule of 4 μg on days 0 and 14, 0 and 21, or 0 and 28. Participants within each cohort were randomly assigned by stratified block randomisation (block size eight) and allocated (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo. Group allocation was concealed from participants, investigators, and outcome assessors. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity, assessed as the neutralising antibody responses against infectious SARS-CoV-2. This study is registered with www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000032459. Findings: In phase 1, 192 participants were enrolled (mean age 53·7 years [SD 15·6]) and were randomly assigned to receive vaccine (2 μg [n=24], 4 μg [n=24], or 8 μg [n=24] for both age groups [18-59 years and ≥60 years]) or placebo (n=24). At least one adverse reaction was reported within the first 7 days of inoculation in 42 (29%) of 144 vaccine recipients. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (18-59 years, one [4%] in the 2 μg group, one [4%] in the 4 μg group, and two [8%] in the 8 μg group; ≥60 years, one [4%] in the 8 μg group). All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days post vaccination. Neutralising antibody geometric mean titres were higher at day 42 in the group aged 18-59 years (87·7 [95% CI 64·9-118·6], 2 μg group; 211·2 [158·9-280·6], 4 μg group; and 228·7 [186·1-281·1], 8 μg group) and the group aged 60 years and older (80·7 [65·4-99·6], 2 μg group; 131·5 [108·2-159·7], 4 μg group; and 170·87 [133·0-219·5], 8 μg group) compared with the placebo group (2·0 [2·0-2·0]). In phase 2, 448 participants were enrolled (mean age 41·7 years [SD 9·9]) and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (8 μg on day 0 [n=84] or 4 μg on days 0 and 14 [n=84], days 0 and 21 [n=84], or days 0 and 28 [n=84]) or placebo on the same schedules (n=112). At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days was reported in 76 (23%) of 336 vaccine recipients (33 [39%], 8 μg day 0; 18 [21%], 4 μg days 0 and 14; 15 [18%], 4 μg days 0 and 21; and ten [12%], 4 μg days 0 and 28). One placebo recipient in the 4 μg days 0 and 21 group reported grade 3 fever, but was self-limited and recovered. All other adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (one [1%], 8 μg day 0; one [1%], 4 μg days 0 and 14; three [4%], 4 μg days 0 and 21; two [2%], 4 μg days 0 and 28). The vaccine-elicited neutralising antibody titres on day 28 were significantly greater in the 4 μg days 0 and 14 (169·5, 95% CI 132·2-217·1), days 0 and 21 (282·7, 221·2-361·4), and days 0 and 28 (218·0, 181·8-261·3) schedules than the 8 μg day 0 schedule (14·7, 11·6-18·8; all p<0·001). Interpretation: The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV, is safe and well tolerated at all tested doses in two age groups. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 were induced in all vaccine recipients on day 42. Two-dose immunisation with 4 μg vaccine on days 0 and 21 or days 0 and 28 achieved higher neutralising antibody titres than the single 8 μg dose or 4 μg dose on days 0 and 14.

4613,Role of the Eye in Transmitting Human Coronavirus: What We Know and What We Do Not Know.,"The outbreak of the current 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, now named SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a worldwide health threat. Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low. This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract. However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection. Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice."
4614,Public health response to an outbreak of SARS-CoV2 infection in a Barcelona prison.,"An outbreak of SARS-CoV2 infection in a Barcelona prison was studied. One hundred and forty-eight inmates and 36 prison staff were evaluated by rt-PCR, and 24.1% (40 prisoners, two health workers and four non-health workers) tested positive. In all, 94.8% of cases were asymptomatic. The inmates were isolated in prison module 4, which was converted into an emergency COVID unit. There were no deaths. Generalised screening and the isolation and evaluation of the people infected were key measures. Symptom-based surveillance must be supplemented by rapid contact-based monitoring in order to avoid asymptomatic spread among prisoners and the community at large."
4615,Apparent Life-Threatening Event in an Infant with SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"The 2019 novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a global outbreak of infection. In general, children with coronavirus disease-2019 have been reported to show milder respiratory symptoms than adult patients. Here, we have described a case of a SARS-CoV-2-infected infant who presented to our hospital with a severe episode of an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE). An 8-month-old, otherwise healthy female infant presented to our hospital because of a sudden cardiopulmonary arrest. Approximately 1 h before this episode, the patient showed no symptoms, except a worse humor than usual. On arrival at our hospital, the patient had severe acidosis, but there were no clear signs of inflammatory response. Chest computed tomography showed weak consolidations in the upper right lung and atelectasis in the lower left lung. No signs of congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy were observed on echocardiography, and no significant arrhythmia was observed during the clinical course. However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in tracheal aspirate and urine samples. Although the assessment of further similar cases is indispensable, this case suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be an underlying factor in the pathophysiology of ALTE."
4616,Out of Africa: A Solidarity-Based Approach to Vaccine Allocation.,"This article sets forth a solidaristic approach to global distribution of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our approach draws inspiration from African ethics and from the characterization of the Covid-19 crisis as a syndemic, a convergence of biosocial forces that interact with one another to produce and exacerbate clinical disease and prognosis. The first section elaborates the twin ideas of syndemic and solidarity. The second section argues that these ideas lend support to global health alliances to distribute vaccines beyond national borders. The third section introduces ethical criteria to guide global distribution, emphasizing priority to low- and middle-income countries, which have the least ability to obtain vaccines on their own. It also justifies giving priority to people at high risk of infection and high risk of severe disease and death."

4618,Implications of anesthesia and vaccination.,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact on vaccination rates. Delays in routine healthcare and immunization have led to a rise in concerns about resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases around the world. With the release and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, plans to improve immunization rates need to be explored and implemented across disciplines. One approach would be the consideration of perioperative vaccinations; however, the effects of anesthesia and surgery on the immune response and complications associated with vaccination during the perioperative period are still poorly understood, and opinions are divided. To ascertain the value of a perioperative vaccination program, it is important to understand the basics of immunization and common vaccinations; the potential vaccine complications in the pediatric cohort; the implications of anesthesia and surgery on the immune response; and current recommendations. In addition, we believe it is important to discuss the logistics and feasibility of coordinating perioperative immunization should this become a regular opportunity."
4619,Environmental concern regarding the effect of humidity and temperature on 2019-nCoV survival: fact or fiction.,"The new coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a new type of virus that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Environmental conditions necessary for survival and spread of 2019-nCoV are somewhat transparent but unlike animal coronaviruses. We are poorly aware of their survival in environment and precise factors of their transmission. Countries located in east and west of globe did not have a significant impact on prevalence of disease among communities, and on the other hand, north and south have provided a model for relative prediction of disease outbreaks. The 2019-nCoV can survive for up to 9 days at 25 °C, and if this temperature rises to 30 °C, its lifespan will be shorter. The 2019-nCoV is sensitive to humidity, and lifespan of viruses in 50% humidity is longer than that of 30%. Also, temperature and humidity are important factors influencing the COVID-19 mortality rate and may facilitate 2019-nCoV transmission. Thus, considering the available and recent evidence, it seems that low temperatures, as well as dry and unventilated air, may affect stability and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV."
