7310,Clinical characteristics and diagnostic challenges of pediatric COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background/purpose: Current studies on pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rare. The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown. Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children. Methods: We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series. Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed. A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. Results: Nine case series were included. In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history. The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%). Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care. Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%. Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon. There are 26% children are asymptomatic. The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%). Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease. Conclusion: COVID-19 has distinct features in children. The disease severity is mild. Current diagnosis is based mainly on typical ground glass opacities on chest CT, epidemiological suspicion and contact tracing."
7311,"Occupation- and age-associated risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, the Netherlands, June to October 2020.","High coronavirus incidence has prompted the Netherlands to implement a second lockdown. To elucidate the epidemic's development preceding this second wave, we analysed weekly test positivity in public test locations by population subgroup between 1 June and 17 October 2020. Hospitality and public transport workers, driving instructors, hairdressers and aestheticians had higher test positivity compared with a reference group of individuals without a close-contact occupation. Workers in childcare, education and healthcare showed lower test positivity."

7314,A pocket guide on how to structure SARS-CoV-2 drugs and therapies.,"The race to identify a successful treatment for COVID19 will be defined by fundamental research into the replication cycle of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This has identified five distinct stages from which numerous vaccination and clinical trials have emerged alongside an innumerable number of drug discovery studies currently in development for disease intervention. Informing every step of the viral replication cycle has been an unprecedented 'call-to-arms' by the global structural biology community. Of the 20 main SARS-CoV-2 proteins, 13 have been resolved structurally for SARS-CoV-2 with most having a related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV structural homologue totalling some 300 structures currently available in public repositories. Herein, we review the contribution of structural studies to our understanding of the virus and their role in structure-based development of therapeutics."
7315,COVID-19 health and social care access for autistic people: European policy review.,"Background: The global COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on European health and social care systems, with demands on testing, hospital and intensive care capacity exceeding available resources in many regions. This has led to concerns that some vulnerable groups, including autistic people, may be excluded from services. Methods: We reviewed policies from 15 European member states, published in March-July 2020, pertaining to (1) access to COVID-19 tests; (2) provisions for treatment, hospitalisation and intensive care units (ICUs); and (3) changes to standard health and social care. In parallel, we analysed survey data on the lived experiences of 1301 autistic people and caregivers. Results: Autistic people experienced significant barriers when accessing COVID-19 services. First, despite being at elevated risk of severe illness due to co-occurring health conditions, there was a lack of accessibility of COVID-19 testing. Second, many COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient treatment services were reported to be inaccessible, predominantly resulting from individual differences in communication needs. Third, ICU triage protocols in many European countries (directly or indirectly) resulted in discriminatory exclusion from lifesaving treatments. Finally, interruptions to standard health and social care left over 70% of autistic people without everyday support. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated existing healthcare inequalities for autistic people, probably contributing to disproportionate increases in morbidity and mortality, mental health and behavioural difficulties, and reduced quality of life. An urgent need exists for policies and guidelines on accessibility of COVID-19 services to be updated to prevent the widespread exclusion of autistic people from services, which represents a violation of international human rights law."
7316,The Cellular basis of loss of smell in 2019-nCoV-infected individuals.,"A prominent clinical symptom of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is hyposmia/anosmia (decrease or loss of sense of smell), along with general symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, fever and cough. The identity of the cell lineages that underpin the infection-associated loss of olfaction could be critical for the clinical management of 2019-nCoV-infected individuals. Recent research has confirmed the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) as key host-specific cellular moieties responsible for the cellular entry of the virus. Accordingly, the ongoing medical examinations and the autopsy reports of the deceased individuals indicate that organs/tissues with high expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other putative viral entry-associated genes are most vulnerable to the infection. We studied if anosmia in 2019-nCoV-infected individuals can be explained by the expression patterns associated with these host-specific moieties across the known olfactory epithelial cell types, identified from a recently published single-cell expression study. Our findings underscore selective expression of these viral entry-associated genes in a subset of sustentacular cells (SUSs), Bowman's gland cells (BGCs) and stem cells of the olfactory epithelium. Co-expression analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and protein-protein interaction among the host and viral proteins elected regulatory cytoskeleton protein-enriched SUSs as the most vulnerable cell type of the olfactory epithelium. Furthermore, expression, structural and docking analyses of ACE2 revealed the potential risk of olfactory dysfunction in four additional mammalian species, revealing an evolutionarily conserved infection susceptibility. In summary, our findings provide a plausible cellular basis for the loss of smell in 2019-nCoV-infected patients."
7317,Older adolescents and young adults willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine: Implications for informing public health strategies.,"Importance: The success in ending the COVID-19 pandemic rests partly on the mass uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Little work has been done to understand vaccine willingness among older adolescents and young adults. This is important since this age group may be less likely to adhere to public health guidelines. Objective: To understand willingness of getting a vaccine and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among a sample of older adolescents and young adults. Design: Data were from the Well-Being and Experiences study (The WE Study), a longitudinal community-based sample of older adolescents and young adults collected from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from 2017 to 2020 (n = 664). Setting: The study setting was a community-based observational longitudinal study. Participants: Participants for the study were aged 14 to 17 years old at baseline in 2016-17 (n = 1000). Data were also collected on one parent/caregiver. Waves 2 (n = 747) and 3 (n = 664) were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Exposures: The main exposures were sociodemographic factors, health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, and adversity history. Main outcomes: The main outcomes were COVID-19 vaccine willingness, hesitancy, and reasons for hesitancy. Results: Willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was 65.4%. Willingness did not differ by age, sex, or mental health conditions, but did differ for other sociodemographic characteristics, physical health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, practicing social/physical distancing, and adversity history. The most common reasons for not wanting a vaccine were related to safety, knowledge, and effectiveness. Sex differences were noted. Conclusions and relevance: Increasing uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among older adolescents and young adults may rely on targeting individuals from households with lower income, financial burden, and adversity history, and generating public health messaging specifically aimed at vaccine safety, how it works to protect against illness, and why it is important to protect oneself against a COVID-19 infection."
7318,"Similarities and differences in the conformational stability and reversibility of ORF8, an accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2, and its L84S variant.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has the characteristic accessory protein ORF8. Although clinical reports indicate that ORF8 variant strains (Î”382 and L84S variants) are less likely to cause severe illness, functional differences between wild-type and variant ORF8 are unknown. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the ORF8 protein have not been analyzed. In this study, the physicochemical properties of the wild-type ORF8 and its L84S variant were analyzed and compared. Using the tobacco BY-2 cell production system, which has been successfully used to produce the wild-type ORF8 protein with a single conformation, was used to successfully produce the ORF8 L84S variant protein at the same level as wild-type ORF8. The produced proteins were purified, and their temperature and pH dependencies were examined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Our data suggested that the wild-type and L84S variant ORF8 structures are highly stable over a wide temperature range. Both proteins displayed an aggregated conformation at higher temperature that reverted when the temperature was decreased to room temperature. Moreover, ORF8 precipitated at acidic pH and this precipitation was reversed when the solution pH was shifted to neutral. Interestingly, the L84S variant exhibited greater solubility than wild-type ORF8 under acidic conditions. Thus, the finding indicated that conformational stability and reversibility of ORF8 are key properties related to function in oppressive environments."
