6222,"Development, performance evaluation, and clinical application of a Rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG Test Kit based on automated fluorescence immunoassay.","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has made a huge impact on health, economies, and societies all over the world. Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based nucleic acid detection has been primarily used in the diagnosis of COVID-19, it is time-consuming with limited application scenarios and must be operated by qualified personnel. Antibody test, particularly point-of-care antibody testing, is a suitable complement to nucleic acid test as it provides rapid, portable, and cost-effective detection of infections. In this study, a Rapid Antibody Test Kit was developed based on fluorescence immunochromatography for the sensitive, accurate, and automated detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human serum, plasma, and whole blood samples within 10 min. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, and stability of the test kit were of good performance. No cross-activity and no interference was observed. In the multiple-center parallel study, 223 samples from hospitalized patients were used to evaluate the clinical specificity of the test. Both SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG achieved a clinical specificity of 98.21%. The clinical sensitivities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 79.54% and 87.45%, respectively, among 733 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 samples. For the combined IgM and IgG assays, the sensitivity and specificity were 89.22% and 96.86%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the combined use of IgM and IgG could serve as a more suitable alternative detection method for patients with COVID-19, and the developed kit is of great public health significance for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic."
6223,"Nanomedicine as a promising approach for diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis against COVID-19.","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) puts the world in an unprecedented crisis, leaving behind huge human losses and deep socioeconomic damages. Due to the lack of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2, effective vaccines and antiviral agents are urgently needed to properly restrain the COVID-19 pandemic. Repositioned drugs such as remdesivir have revealed a promising clinical efficacy against COVID-19. Interestingly, nanomedicine as a promising therapeutic approach could effectively help win the battle between coronaviruses (CoVs) and host cells. This review discusses the potential therapeutic approaches, in addition to the contribution of nanomedicine against CoVs in the fields of vaccination, diagnosis and therapy."

6225,Negative nasopharyngeal swabs early in the course of COVID-19.,"Background: The diagnosis of COVID-19 is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Studies have shown a percentage of up to 30 % false negative results. Case presentation: A previously healthy man in his late thirties was admitted to the hospital after 3-5 days of suffering chest pain, dyspnoea and abdominal discomfort. He had hypoxic respiratory failure and required oxygen therapy. The routine nasopharyngeal swab for PCR was negative at days 5 and 7 after onset of symptoms. A specimen obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage on day 8 was positive. Interpretation: This case report shows us that even in the early course of SARS-Cov-2 infection, when the viral load in the upper respiratory tract has been shown to be at its highest, there might be false negative tests. It also emphasises the importance of including other clinical measures before discontinuation of isolation."
6226,Safety and humoral responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination of SARS-CoV-2 previously infected and naive populations.,"Since COVID-19 risk of reinfection is of great concern, the safety and efficacy of the mRNA-based vaccines in previously infected populations should be assessed. We studied 78 individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-19, who received a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and 1:2 ratio matched infection-naïve cohort who received two injections. The evaluation procedure included symptom monitoring, and serological tests. Among the post-infected population, the median IgG-S response after the first vaccine dose was 3.35 AU, compared to 2.38 AU after the second vaccine injection in the infection naive group. A strong correlation was demonstrated between IgG-S level before vaccination, and the corresponding responses after a single vaccine dose (r = 0.8, p < 0.001) in the post infected population. Short-term severe symptoms that required medical attention were found in 6.8% among the post-infected individuals, while none were found in the infection naïve population. Our data suggest that a single vaccine dose is sufficient to induce an intense immune response in post-infected population regardless of seropositivity. Although some short-term safety issues were observed compared to the infection naïve population, a single dose regimen can be considered safe in post-infected populations."
6227,SARS-CoV-2 detection by fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification with and without RNA extraction.,"Rapid and simple point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent need to prevent pandemic. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) can detect SARS-CoV-2 more rapidly than RT-PCR. Saliva is non-invasive specimen suitable for mass-screening, but data comparing utility of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and saliva in RT-LAMP test are lacking and it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by direct processing of samples without the need for prior RNA extraction saliva. In this study, we compared utility of saliva and NPS samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by a novel RT-fluorescence LAMP (RT-fLAMP). The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-fLAMP with RNA extraction were 97% and 100%, respectively, with equivalent utility of NPS and saliva. However, sensitivity was decreased to 71% and 47% in NPS and saliva samples without RNA extraction, respectively, suggesting that RNA extraction process may be critical for the virus detection by RT-fLAMP."

6229,An Optimal Nucleic Acid Testing Strategy for COVID-19 during the Spring Festival Travel Rush in Mainland China: A Modelling Study.,"Western countries are experiencing surges in COVID-19 cases and deaths due to increasing public transportation during holiday seasons. This study aimed to explore whether mainland China will face an epidemic rebound during the Spring Festival holiday, when millions of Chinese people travel across the country, and investigate which nucleic acid testing (NAT) strategy is optimal to contain the epidemic. A microsimulation model was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among railway travelers and evaluated the effects of various NAT strategies. An extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was built to forecast local transmission during the Spring Festival period under different scenarios of testing strategies. The total number of infections, testing burden, and medical expenditure were calculated to devise an optimal strategy during the Spring Festival travel rush. Assuming the daily incidence of 20 per 10 million persons, our model simulated that there would be 97 active infections on the day of travel among 10 million railway passengers without NAT and symptom screening. Pre-travel testing could reduce the number of active infections. Compared with no NAT, testing passengers from risk tier 2-4 regions 3 days before travelling could significantly reduce the risk of transmission, and it is more economical and efficient than testing for all passengers."
