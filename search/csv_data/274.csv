2730,Clinical Evaluation of BD Veritor SARS-CoV-2 Point-of-Care Test Performance Compared to PCR-Based Testing and versus the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen Point-of-Care Test.,"The clinical performance of the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (Veritor), a chromatographic immunoassay used for SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care testing, was evaluated using nasal specimens from individuals with COVID-19 symptoms. Two studies were completed to determine clinical performance. In the first study, nasal specimens and either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens from 251 participants with COVID-19 symptoms (≤7 days from symptom onset [DSO], ≥18 years of age) were utilized to compare Veritor with the Lyra SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay (Lyra). In the second study, nasal specimens from 361 participants with COVID-19 symptoms (≤5 DSO, ≥18 years of age) were utilized to compare performance of Veritor to that of the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2). The positive, negative, and overall percent agreement (PPA, NPA, and OPA, respectively) were the primary outcomes. In study 1, the PPA for Veritor, compared to Lyra, ranged from 81.8 to 87.5% across the 0 to 1 and 0 to 6 DSO ranges. In study 2, Veritor had PPA, NPA, and OPA values of 97.4, 98.1, and 98.1%, respectively, with Sofia 2. Discordant analysis showed one Lyra positive missed by Veritor and five Lyra positives missed by Sofia 2; one Veritor positive result was negative by Lyra. Veritor met FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) acceptance criteria for SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing for the 0 to 5 and 0 to 6 DSO ranges (PPA values of 83.9% and 82.4%, respectively). Veritor and Sofia 2 showed a high degree of agreement for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The Veritor test allows for more rapid COVID-19 testing utilizing easy-to-collect nasal swabs but demonstrated <100% PPA compared to PCR."

2732,Why Fast COVID-19 Vaccination Needed for People with Disabilities and Autistics in Korea?,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively affected the lives of people with disabilities; therefore, they need fast vaccination allocation. However, many countries, especially the Republic of Korea, have hesitated to vaccinate people with disabilities. This opinion article will explain why vaccine allocation priority is required for autistic people and people with disabilities in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, including reporting on self-quarantine's stresses and psychological burdens."
2733,"[Intensive covid-19 care in general practice; nationwide registration study, initiated by General Practice Research Consortium Netherlands].","Method: Registration system initiated by General Practice Research Consortium Netherlands (GPRC-NL). Aim: To obtain national estimates on clinically suspected Covid-19 mortality in general practice and on intensive and palliative covid-19 care provided by general practitioners (GPs) outside hospital, including palliative medication, availability of personal protective equipment, and reasons for not referring to hospital of vulnerable patients during the first three months of the Covid-19 pandemic in The Netherlands. Design: Nationwide registration study, in which 2.331 GP practices in The Netherlands participated from March-June 2020. Method: Registration system initiated by General Practice Research Consortium Netherlands (GPRC-NL) through existing digital referral platform ZorgDomein, in which GPs could report PCR-proven and clinically suspected Covid-19 deceased patients to estimate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in primary care. Results: GPs reported 1,566 Covid-19 deceased patients, of which 61% (949/1,566) were clinically suspected but not PCR-tested, with large regional differences, and most deaths being reported in the provinces of Brabant and Limburg. Patients had a median duration from onset of symptoms to death of 8 days and a median age of 87 years. GPs reported 1,030 patients for which they delivered intensive or palliative care, of which 56% had a Clinical Frailty Score higher or equal to six. Most mentioned reason for GPs and patients in the decision not going to hospital were the explicit wish of the patient (59%) and somatic vulnerability (52%). Conclusion: GPs provided palliative care to a large number of clinically suspected Covid-19 vulnerable patients with large regional differences across The Netherlands. Reported GPs' and patients' considerations to refrain from hospital care can be used to guide future primary care for vulnerable Covid-19 patients."

2735,Regulatory status quo and prospects for biosurfactants in pharmaceutical applications.,"The concept of going 'green' and 'cold' has led to utilizing renewable resources for the synthesis of microbial biosurfactants that are both patient and eco-friendly. In this review, we shed light on the potential and regulatory aspects of biosurfactants in pharmaceutical applications and how they can significantly contribute to novel concepts for the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and future treatment. We emphasize that more specific guidelines should be formulated to regulate the approval of biosurfactants for human use. It is also crucial to implement a risk-based approach from the early research and development (R&D) phase in addition to establishing more robust standardized techniques and assays to evaluate the characteristics of biosurfactants."
2736,"Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults aged 65 years and older in primary care: I-MOVE-COVID-19 project, Europe, December 2020 to May 2021.","We measured COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at primary care/outpatient level among adults ≥ 65 years old using a multicentre test-negative design in eight European countries. We included 592 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 4,372 test-negative controls in the main analysis. The VE was 62% (95% CI: 45-74) for one dose only and 89% (95% CI: 79-94) for complete vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines provide good protection against COVID-19 presentation at primary care/outpatient level, particularly among fully vaccinated individuals."
2737,Comparison of RNA In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry Techniques for the Detection and Localization of SARS-CoV-2 in Human Tissues.,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although SARS-CoV-2 is visualized on electron microscopy, there is an increasing demand for widely applicable techniques to visualize viral components within tissue specimens. Viral protein and RNA can be detected on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively. Herein, we evaluate the staining performance of ISH for SARS-CoV-2 and an IHC directed at the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and compare these results to a gold standard, tissue quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We evaluated FFPE sections from 8 COVID-19 autopsies, including 19 pulmonary and 39 extrapulmonary samples including the heart, liver, kidney, small intestine, skin, adipose tissue, and bone marrow. We performed RNA-ISH for SARS-CoV-2 on all cases with IHC for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR performed on selected cases. Lungs from 37 autopsies performed before the COVID-19 pandemic served as negative controls. The ISH and IHC slides were reviewed by 4 observers to record a consensus opinion. Selected ISH and IHC slides were also reviewed by 4 independent observers. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on both the IHC and ISH platforms. Within the postmortem lung, detected viral protein and RNA were often extracellular, predominantly within hyaline membranes in patients with diffuse alveolar damage. Among individual cases, there was regional variation in the amount of detectable virus in lung samples. Intracellular viral RNA and protein was localized to pneumocytes and immune cells. Viral RNA was detected on RNA-ISH in 13 of 19 (68%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19. Viral protein was detected on IHC in 8 of 9 (88%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19, although in 5 cases the stain was interpreted as equivocal. From the control cohort, FFPE blocks from all 37 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-ISH, whereas 5 of 13 cases were positive on IHC. Collectively, when compared with qRT-PCR on individual tissue blocks, the sensitivity and specificity for ISH was 86.7% and 100%, respectively, while those for IHC were 85.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The interobserver variability for ISH ranged from moderate to almost perfect, whereas that for IHC ranged from slight to moderate. All extrapulmonary samples from COVID-19-positive cases were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 is detectable on both RNA-ISH and nucleocapsid IHC. In the lung, viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein is predominantly extracellular and within hyaline membranes in some cases, while intracellular locations are more prominent in others. The intracellular virus is detected within pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and possibly immune cells. The ISH platform is more specific, easier to analyze and the interpretation is associated with the improved interobserver agreement. ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR failed to detect the virus in the heart, liver, and kidney."

2739,"Students' Views towards Sars-Cov-2 Mass Asymptomatic Testing, Social Distancing and Self-Isolation in a University Setting during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study.","We aimed to explore university students' perceptions and experiences of SARS-CoV-2 mass asymptomatic testing, social distancing and self-isolation, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study comprised of four rapid online focus groups conducted at a higher education institution in England, during high alert (tier 2) national COVID-19 restrictions. Participants were purposively sampled university students (n = 25) representing a range of gender, age, living circumstances (on/off campus), and SARS-CoV-2 testing/self-isolation experiences. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Six themes with 16 sub-themes emerged from the analysis of the qualitative data: 'Term-time Experiences', 'Risk Perception and Worry', 'Engagement in Protective Behaviours', 'Openness to Testing', 'Barriers to Testing' and 'General Wellbeing'. Students described feeling safe on campus, believed most of their peers are adherent to protective behaviours and were positive towards asymptomatic testing in university settings. University communications about COVID-19 testing and social behaviours need to be timely and presented in a more inclusive way to reach groups of students who currently feel marginalised. Barriers to engagement with SARS-CoV-2 testing, social distancing and self-isolation were primarily associated with fear of the mental health impacts of self-isolation, including worry about how they will cope, high anxiety, low mood, guilt relating to impact on others and loneliness. Loneliness in students could be mitigated through increased intra-university communications and a focus on establishment of low COVID-risk social activities to help students build and enhance their social support networks. These findings are particularly pertinent in the context of mass asymptomatic testing programmes being implemented in educational settings and high numbers of students being required to self-isolate. Universities need to determine the support needs of students during self-isolation and prepare for the long-term impacts of the pandemic on student mental health and welfare support services."
