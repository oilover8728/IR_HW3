7400,Current efforts and challenges facing responses to 2019-nCoV in Africa.,"The novel coronavirus is a pandemic that has started to creep into Africa thus making the virus a truly global, health security threat. The number of new 2019-nCoV cases has been rising in Africa, though currently lower than the cases reported outside the region. African countries have activated their Emergency Operations Centres to coordinate responses and preparedness activities to the pandemic. A series of measures such as restricting travel, case detection and contact tracing, mandatory quarantine, guidance and information to the public among other efforts are being implemented across Africa. However, the presence of porous borders, the double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, poverty, poor health literacy, infodemic and family clustering, and most of all, weak health systems, may make containment challenging. It is important for African countries to continue to intensify efforts and address the challenges to effectively respond to the uncertainty the pandemic poses."

7402,Haematological malignancy and nosocomial transmission are associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19: results of a multi-center UK cohort.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a disruptive event for cancer patients, especially those with haematological malignancies (HM). They may experience a more severe clinical course due to impaired immune responses. This multi-center retrospective UK audit identified cancer patients who had SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 March and 10 June 2020 and collected data pertaining to cancer history, COVID-19 presentation and outcomes. In total, 179 patients were identified with a median age of 72 (IQR 61, 81) and follow-up of 44 days (IQR 42, 45). Forty-one percent were female and the overall mortality was 37%. Twenty-nine percent had HM and of these, those treated with chemotherapy in the preceding 28 days to COVID-19 diagnosis had worse outcome compared with solid malignancy (SM): 62% versus 19% died [HR 8.33 (95% CI, 2.56-25), p < 0.001]. Definite or probable nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission accounted for 16% of cases and was associated with increased risk of death (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.43-4.29, p = 0.001). Patients with haematological malignancies and those who acquire nosocomial transmission are at increased risk of death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reassess shielding advice, reinforce stringent infection control, and ensure regular patient and staff testing to prevent nosocomial transmission."
7403,Pharmacological agents to therapeutic treatment of cardiac injury caused by Covid-19.,"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a global pandemic that began in March 2020 and is currently in progress. To date, COVID-19 has caused about 935,000 deaths in more than 200 countries. The respiratory system is most affected by injuries caused by COVID-19, but other organs may be involved, including the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE-2). ACE-2 is expressed not only in the lungs, but also in other organs, including the cardiovascular system. Several studies have found that a good percentage of patients with severe COVID-19 have cardiac lesions, including myocardial fibrosis, edema and pericarditis. Pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix caused by viral infection leads to myocardial fibrotic lesions. These fibrotic scars can cause cardiac dysfunction, reducing the ejection fraction caused by the presence of stiffened myocardial matrix, or cardiac arrhythmias that cause an alteration in the electrical conduction system of the heart. These cardiac dysfunctions can cause death. It is therefore essential to identify cardiac involvement early in order to act with appropriate therapeutic treatments. In this review, we describe what is known about cardiac injury from COVID-19, highlighting effective pharmacological therapeutic solutions to combat cardiac injury, particularly cardiac fibrosis, caused by COVID-19."
7404,Assessment of Risks Associated With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Experimental Human Infection Studies.,"Controlled human infection (CHI) models for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been proposed as a tool to accelerate the development of vaccines and drugs. Such models carry inherent risks. Participants may develop severe disease or complications after deliberate infection. Prolonged isolation may negatively impact their well-being. Through secondary infection of study personnel or participant household contacts, the experimental virus strain may cause a community outbreak. We identified risks associated with such a SARS-CoV-2 CHI model and assessed their likelihood and impact and propose strategies that mitigate these risks. In this report, we show that risks can be minimized with proper risk mitigation strategies; the residual risk, however, should be weighed carefully against the scientific and social values of such a CHI model."
7405,COVID-19 Pneumonia in Vaccinated Population: A Six Clinical and Radiological Case Series.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its related disease (COVID-19) continue to represent a challenge for humans. To date, vaccination programs have represented an opportunity to navigate the pandemic. However, the advent of new genetic COVID-19 variants has increased more attention representing a worrying threat not only for not vaccinated but also for vaccinated people as virus infections have been shown also in the last ones. Herein, we report different clinical cases and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in six fully vaccinated patients. Two patients had a history of Rituximab therapy for follicular lymphoma and with persistent positivity for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs and with moderate pneumonia on the chest computed tomography (CT). One patient who resulted to be positive to delta variant 8 days after the second vaccination dose, died shortly after. Two patients were hospitalized due to the worsening of fever and dyspnea in presence of mild pneumonia on CT. In one patient mild pneumonia was found on the chest-CT performed after a lipothymic episode associated with chest pain and positive NP/OP swab tested for SARS-CoV-2. These data suggested that in fully vaccinated people, caution should be preserved, and the use of masks and social distancing should be continued in all closed environments. However, further clinical trials should be done to better understand how various factors can influence vaccine immunogenicity as the presence of virus mutations, age factors, and the presence of an immunocompromised state."

7407,The immunodominant and neutralization linear epitopes for SARS-CoV-2.,"Although vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are under development, the antigen epitopes on the virus and their immunogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we simulate the 3D structures and predict the B cell epitopes on the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches and validate epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induce antibody production, six of these are immunodominant epitopes in individuals, and 23 are conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We find that the immunodominant epitopes of individuals with domestic (China) SARS-CoV-2 are different from those of individuals with imported (Europe) SARS-CoV-2, which may be caused by mutations on the S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we find several epitopes on the S protein that elicit neutralizing antibodies against D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to vaccine design against coronaviruses."
7408,"Production and use of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 treatment, taking into account the experience in the Central Millitary Hospital Prague.","One of the available treatment alternatives for COVID-19 is the administration of convalescent plasma (CP), blood plasma obtained from people who have undergone the disease. Administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma is a method of passive specific immunization with an expected therapeutic response. CP can also be used for production a specific immunoglobulin. Experience from previous epidemic infections, caused by the coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, shows that CP contains neutralizing antibodies against the virus, which are probably the main source of its therapeutic potential. However, other immune mechanisms cannot be ruled out, such as antibody-induced cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis. The use of CP for the treatment of COVID-19 spread during the first half of year 2020 in many countries worldwide and relatively common is also in the Czech Republic, where, at the end of August 2020, about 100 patients were treated with CP. The production and use of CP is governed by the national multidisciplinary guidelines from April 2020 and the recommended therapeutic dose are 2 TU RP (400-450 mL), resp. 4-6 mL/kg. CP is indicated mainly in severe cases of COVID-19, which require oxygen support, ideally within 2-3 days after diagnosis, but our and foreign experience shows a beneficial effect of CP even in moderately severe cases that do not need oxygen treatment."
