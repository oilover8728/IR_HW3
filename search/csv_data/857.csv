8561,Sex-biased Immune Responses Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Males are disproportionately affected by severe disease and death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In their recent article, Takahashi et al. found sex differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the predictors of disease progression. These findings contribute to elucidating the mechanisms that underlie the male bias in severe disease and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
8562,"Transmission Dynamics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in High-Density Settings, Minnesota, USA, March-June 2020.","Coronavirus disease has disproportionately affected persons in congregate settings and high-density workplaces. To determine more about the transmission patterns of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in these settings, we performed whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis on 319 (14.4%) samples from 2,222 SARS-CoV-2-positive persons associated with 8 outbreaks in Minnesota, USA, during March-June 2020. Sequencing indicated that virus spread in 3 long-term care facilities and 2 correctional facilities was associated with a single genetic sequence and that in a fourth long-term care facility, outbreak cases were associated with 2 distinct sequences. In contrast, cases associated with outbreaks in 2 meat-processing plants were associated with multiple SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These results suggest that a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into a facility can result in a widespread outbreak. Early identification and cohorting (segregating) of virus-positive persons in these settings, along with continued vigilance with infection prevention and control measures, is imperative."
8563,Emerging prophylaxis strategies against COVID-19.,"The Novel corona virus 2019 which started as an outbreak in China in December 2019 has rapidly spread all over the world, such that on 11th March 2020 WHO declared this disease as pandemic. The emergency that the world faces today demands that we develop urgent and effective measures to protect people at high risk of transmission. WHO has accelerated research in diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus."
8564,Current understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on gastrointestinal disease: Challenges and openings.,"The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the Coronaviridae family. In March 2019 the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. COVID-19 patients typically have a fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and anosmia. Some patients also report gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver enzyme abnormalities. Surprisingly, many studies have found severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA in rectal swabs and stool specimens of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. In addition, viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine-type 2, were also found to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 can dynamically infect and replicate in both GI and liver cells. Taken together these results indicate that the GI tract is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the present review summarizes the vital information available to date on COVID-19 and its impact on GI aspects."

8566,Mutations in membrane-fusion subunit of spike glycoprotein play crucial role in the recent outbreak of COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), the ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major threat to the entire human race. It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 seems to have relatively low pathogenicity and higher transmissibility than previously outbroke SARS-CoV. To explore the reason of the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV, we have performed a comparative analysis on the structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein) of two viruses. Our analysis revealed that extensive substitutions of hydrophobic to polar and charged amino acids in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV2 creates an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) at the beginning of membrane-fusion subunit and intrinsically disordered residues in fusion peptide. IDR provides a potential site for proteolysis by furin and enriched disordered residues facilitate prompt fusion of the SARS-CoV2 with host membrane by recruiting molecular recognition features. Here, we have hypothesized that mutation-driven accumulation of intrinsically disordered residues in spike glycoproteins play dual role in enhancing viral transmissibility than previous SARS-coronavirus. These analyses may help in epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against COVID-19."
8567,The continuing search for the origins of SARS-CoV-2.,"Since the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019, there has been a global hunt for the origin of the ongoing pandemic. Zhou et al. provide further evidence of coronavirus diversity, including four novel SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, in bat species in Yunnan province, China."
8568,HTCC as a Polymeric Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.,"Among seven coronaviruses that infect humans, three (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV], and the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) are associated with a severe, life-threatening respiratory infection and multiorgan failure. We previously proposed that the cationically modified chitosan N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC) is a potent inhibitor of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). Next, we demonstrated the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the compound, as it inhibited all low-pathogenicity human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1). Here, using in vitro and ex vivo models of human airway epithelia, we show that HTCC effectively blocks MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also confirmed the mechanism of action for these two viruses, showing that the polymer blocks the virus entry into the host cell by interaction with the S protein.IMPORTANCE The beginning of 2020 brought us information about the novel coronavirus emerging in China. Rapid research resulted in the characterization of the pathogen, which appeared to be a member of the SARS-like cluster, commonly seen in bats. Despite the global and local efforts, the virus escaped the health care measures and rapidly spread in China and later globally, officially causing a pandemic and global crisis in March 2020. At present, different scenarios are being written to contain the virus, but the development of novel anticoronavirals for all highly pathogenic coronaviruses remains the major challenge. Here, we describe the antiviral activity of an HTCC compound, previously developed by us, which may be used as a potential inhibitor of currently circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses-SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV."
