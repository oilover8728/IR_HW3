8500,The Potential of Glycyrrhizinate in the Management of COVID-19: A Systematic Review of the Efficacy and Safety of Glycyrrhizin Preparations in the Treatment of SARS and MERS.,"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019 highlighted the fact that no specific medications providing effective treatment have been identified and approved. We explored the possibilities for COVID-19 by systematically reviewing evidence on the efficacy and safety of glycyrrhizin preparations for SARS and MERS. Electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to February 2020 for eligible studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of glycyrrhizin preparations for SARS and MERS. A quantitative analysis or descriptive analysis was applied. Five retrospective cohort studies were included, and NOS scores ranged from 5-7 points. The clinical symptoms of dry cough, chest distress and dyspnoea improved quickly, and elevated serum levels of aminotransferase decreased after compound glycyrrhizin treatment. The SARS-CoV antibody appeared earlier in the treated group than in the control group ([Formula: see text][Formula: see text]d). Compared to that with conventional medications, the average period from peak to 50% improvement of lesions, in terms of X-ray manifestations, was shorter with compound glycyrrhizin treatment ([Formula: see text]2.1[Formula: see text]d), and treatment reduced the dosage ([Formula: see text][Formula: see text]mg/d) and duration of the corticosteroids used, without other serious adverse reactions. Based on the available evidence regarding glycyrrhizin preparations for treating SARS and MERS, we infer that compound glycyrrhizin could be an optional therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially those complicated with liver damage. Further research using well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is warranted to determine the dosage and duration of use of compound glycyrrhizin and to monitor its specific adverse effects."

8503,Systematic review of COVID-19 in children shows milder cases and a better prognosis than adults.,"Aim: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people. Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare. Methods: A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the MEDLINE and Embase databases between January 1 and March 18, 2020. Results: The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1%-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare. Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia. Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare. Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce. Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances. Conclusions: The coronavirus disease 2019 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults. Deaths were extremely rare."

8505,A proposed mechanism for the possible therapeutic potential of Metformin in COVID-19.,"The whole world is facing a tough time these days struggling against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is not any specific effective drug for this viral infection. Thus, we are trying to treat patients with non-specific drug cocktails. Metformin, as a strong base, a potential regulator of Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and endosomal Na+/H+ exchangers (eNHEs), additionally a regenerative agent for lung fibrosis, seems to be beneficial for patients in acute, chronic and recovery phases of COVID-19."

8507,Superhydrophobicity preventing surface contamination as a novel strategy against COVID-19.,"Surface contact with virus is ubiquitous in the transmission pathways of respiratory diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), by which contaminated surfaces are infectious fomites intensifying the transmission of the disease. To date, the influence of surface wettability on fomite formation remains elusive. Here, we report that superhydrophobicity prevents the attachment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on surfaces by repelling virus-laden droplets. Compared to bare surfaces, superhydrophobic (SHPB) surfaces exhibit a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 attachment of up to 99.99995%. We identify the vital importance of solid-liquid adhesion in dominating viral attachment, where the viral activity (N) is proportional to the cube of solid-liquid adhesion (A), N ∝ A3. Our results predict that a surface would be practically free of SARS-CoV-2 deposition when solid-liquid adhesion is ≤1 mN. Engineering surfaces with superhydrophobicity would open an avenue for developing a general approach to preventing fomite formation against the COVID-19 pandemic and future ones."
8508,SARS-CoV-2 viral load and antibody responses: the case for convalescent plasma therapy.,"Most patients with COVID-19 lack antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in the first 10 days of illness while the virus drives disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 antibody deficiency in the setting of a tissue viral burden suggests that using an antibody as a therapeutic agent would augment the antiviral immune response. In this issue of the JCI, Wang and collaborators describe the kinetics of viral load and the antibody responses of 23 individuals with COVID-19 experiencing mild and severe disease. The researchers found that (a) individuals with mild and severe disease produced neutralizing IgG to SARS-CoV-2 10 days after disease onset, (b) SARS-CoV-2 persisted longer in those with severe disease, and (c) there was cross-reactivity between antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, but only antibodies from patients with COVID-19 neutralized SARS-CoV-2. These observations provide important information on the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 that can inform the use of convalescent plasma therapy."

While conducting genomic surveillance (1,663 cases) from December 2020-April 2021 in Arizona, USA, we detected an emergent E484K-harboring variant, B.1.243.1. This finding demonstrates the importance of real-time SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to better inform public health responses."
