2050,Community Coronavirus Disease 2019 Activity Level and Nursing Home Staff Testing for Active Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Indiana.,"Objectives: To assess whether using coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) community activity level can accurately inform strategies for routine testing of facility staff for active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting and participants: In total, 59,930 nursing home staff tested for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in Indiana. Measures: Receiver operator characteristic curves and the area under the curve to compare the sensitivity and specificity of identifying positive cases of staff within facilities based on community COVID-19 activity level including county positivity rate and county cases per 10,000. Results: The detection of any infected staff within a facility using county cases per 10,000 population or county positivity rate resulted in an area under the curve of 0.648 (95% confidence interval 0.601‒0.696) and 0.649 (95% confidence interval 0.601‒0.696), respectively. Of staff tested, 28.0% were certified nursing assistants, yet accounted for 36.9% of all staff testing positive. Similarly, licensed practical nurses were 1.4% of staff, but 4.7% of positive cases. Conclusions and implications: We failed to observe a meaningful threshold of community COVID-19 activity for the purpose of predicting nursing homes with any positive staff. Guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in August 2020 sets the minimum frequency of routine testing for nursing home staff based on county positivity rates. Using the recommended 5% county positivity rate to require weekly testing may miss asymptomatic infections among nursing home staff. Further data on results of all-staff testing efforts, particularly with the implementation of new widespread strategies such as point-of-care testing, is needed to guide policy to protect high-risk nursing home residents and staff. If the goal is to identify all asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infected nursing home staff, comprehensive repeat testing may be needed regardless of community level activity."
2051,"The ID NOW COVID-19, a high-speed high-performance assay.","The ID NOW COVID-19 assay is a promising tool for the rapid identification of COVID-19 patients. However, its performances were questioned. We evaluate the ID NOW COVID-19 in comparison to a reference RT-PCR using a collection of 48 fresh nasopharyngeal swabs sampled on universal transport media (UTM). Only 2 false negatives of the ID NOW COVID-19 were identified. They display PCR cycle threshold values of 37.5 and 39.2. The positive percent agreement and the negative percent agreement were 94.9% and 100%, respectively. The Kappa value was 0.88. The ID NOW COVID-19 combines high-speed and accurate processing. Using UTM, the ID NOW COVID-19 could be repeated in the case of invalid result. Further analyses, such as screening of genetic variants or genome sequencing, could also be performed with the same sample. As for all tests, the results should be interpreted according to clinical and epidemiological context."
2052,Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine.,
2053,[Current state of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2].,"On 21 December 2020 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®, BioNTech, Mainz, Germany; Pfizer, New York City, NY, USA) as the first vaccine against SARS-CoV‑2 in the European Union and the second vaccine (Moderna®, Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) followed on 6 January 2021. Many more approvals will follow within a short period of time. With the availability of the vaccination many questions have arisen for patients as well as for physicians, which are addressed as up to date as possible in this hot topic article."
2054,Is Bordetella pertussis co-infecting SARS-CoV-2 patients?,
2055,Viral targets for vaccines against COVID-19.,"Vaccines are urgently needed to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to help the return to pre-pandemic normalcy. A great many vaccine candidates are being developed, several of which have completed late-stage clinical trials and are reporting positive results. In this Progress article, we discuss which viral elements are used in COVID-19 vaccine candidates, why they might act as good targets for the immune system and the implications for protective immunity."
2056,Head-to-head comparison of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid test with self-collected nasal swab versus professional-collected nasopharyngeal swab.,Supervised nasal self-sampling is a reliable alternative to professional nasopharyngeal sampling using a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid test. Self-sampling and potentially patient self-testing may be a future use case. https://bit.ly/3mup0hS

2058,Monitoring Specific IgM and IgG Production Among Severe COVID-19 Patients Using Qualitative and Quantitative Immunodiagnostic Assays: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"The purpose of this study is to monitor specific anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) IgG and IgM antibody production in patients with severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using various commercially available quantitative and qualitative tests. The sera of 23 confirmed COVID-19 patients were processed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM detection. Three different immunoassays, viz. Abbott Architect® SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, and two quantitative tests, ANSH® SARS-CoV-2 and AESKULISA® SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein (NP), were performed and the results pooled, from diagnosis to serum collection. Seroconversion rates were computed for all 3 assays, and possible correlations were tested using the Pearson correlation coefficient and Cohen's kappa coefficient. Overall, 70 combinations of qualitative and quantitative IgG and IgM results were pooled and analyzed. In the early phase (0-4 days after diagnosis), in all tests, IgG seroconversion rates were 43%-61%, and increased in all tests gradually to 100% after 15 days. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a strong positive relationship between the qualitative IgG test results and both quantitative IgG tests. IgM detection was inconsistent, with maximal concentrations and seroconversion rates between 10-15 days after diagnosis and slight-to-fair agreement between the two quantitative immunoassays. There was no significant association between mortality with IgG or IgM seroconversion or concentrations. Patients with severe COVID-19 develop an early, robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immune response involving IgG immunoglobulins. Further comparative studies are warranted to analyze the value of serological testing in predicting the severity of COVID-19 and detecting prior exposure."
2059,Acute Ischemic Stroke During the Convalescent Phase of Asymptomatic COVID-2019 Infection in Men.,"Importance: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a known neurological complication in patients with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 infection. However, AIS has not been described as a late sequelae in patients without respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. Objective: To assess AIS experienced by adults 50 years or younger in the convalescent phase of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Design, setting, and participants: This case series prospectively identified consecutive male patients who received care for AIS from public health hospitals in Singapore between May 21, 2020, and October 14, 2020. All of these patients had laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic COVID-19 infection based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 serological (antibodies) test result. These patients were individuals from South Asian countries (India and Bangladesh) who were working in Singapore and living in dormitories. The total number of COVID-19 cases (54 485) in the worker dormitory population was the population at risk. Patients with ongoing respiratory symptoms or positive SARS-CoV-2 serological test results confirmed through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swabs were excluded. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical course, imaging, and laboratory findings were retrieved from the electronic medical records of each participating hospital. The incidence rate of AIS in the case series was compared with that of a historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched national cohort. Results: A total of 18 male patients, with a median (range) age of 41 (35-50) years and South Asian ethnicity, were included. The median (range) time from a positive serological test result to AIS was 54.5 (0-130) days. The median (range) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 5 (1-25). Ten patients (56%) presented with a large vessel occlusion, of whom 6 patients underwent intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular therapy. Only 3 patients (17%) had a possible cardiac source of embolus. The estimated annual incidence rate of AIS was 82.6 cases per 100 000 people in this study compared with 38.2 cases per 100 000 people in the historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched cohort (rate ratio, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.36-3.48; P < .001). Conclusions and relevance: This case series suggests that the risk for AIS is higher in adults 50 years or younger during the convalescent period of a COVID-19 infection without respiratory symptoms. Acute ischemic stroke could be part of the next wave of complications of COVID-19, and stroke units should be on alert and use serological testing, especially in younger patients or in the absence of traditional risk factors."
