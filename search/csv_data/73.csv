721,A Review of Treatment and Prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019 among Solid Organ Transplant Recipients.,"Therapeutic management of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may challenge healthcare providers given a paucity of clinical data specific to this cohort. Herein, we summarize and review the studies that have formed the framework for current COVID-19 consensus management guidelines. Our review focuses on COVID-19 treatment options including monoclonal antibody products, antiviral agents such as remdesivir, and immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids, interleukin inhibitors, and kinase inhibitors. We highlight the presence or absence of clinical data of these therapeutics related to the SOT recipient with COVID-19. We also describe data surrounding COVID-19 vaccination of the SOT recipient. Understanding the extent and limitations of observational and clinical trial data for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 specific to the SOT population is crucial for optimal management. Although minimal data exist on clinical outcomes among SOT recipients treated with varying COVID-19 therapeutics, reviewing these agents and the studies that have led to their inclusion or exclusion in clinical management of COVID-19 highlights the need for further studies of these therapeutics in SOT patients with COVID-19."
722,Estimating the false-negative test probability of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.,"BackgroundReverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays are used to test for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives are possible depending on swab type and time since symptom onset.AimTo determine how the probability of obtaining a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptom onset and swab type.MethodsWe used generalised additive mixed models to analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once.ResultsThe probability of a positive test decreased with time since symptom onset, with oropharyngeal (OP) samples less likely to yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal (NP) samples. The probability of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was considerably reduced if negative tests were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test probability (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests.ConclusionNP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected individual is tested after symptom onset, the less likely they are to test positive. This has implications for identifying infected patients, contact tracing and discharging convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious."
723,Inhibition of nonspecific polymerase activity using Poly(Aspartic) acid as a model anionic polyelectrolyte.,"DNA polymerases with strand-displacement activity allow to amplify nucleic acids under isothermal conditions but often lead to undesirable by-products. Here, we report the increase of specificity of isothermal amplification in the presence of poly (aspartic) acids (pAsp). We hypothesized that side reactions occur due to the binding of the phosphate backbone of synthesized DNA strands with surface amino groups of the polymerase, and weakly acidic polyelectrolytes could shield polymerase molecules from DNA and thereby inhibit nonspecific amplification. Suppression of nonspecific polymerase activity by pAsp was studied on multimerization as a model side reaction. It was found that a low concentration of pAsp (0.01%) provides successful amplification of specific DNA targets. The inhibitory effect of pAsp is due to its polymeric structure since aspartic acid did affect neither specific nor nonspecific amplification. Strongly acidic polyelectrolyte heparin does not possess the same selectivity since it suppresses any DNA synthesis. The applicability of pAsp to prevent nonspecific reactions and reliable detection of the specific target has been demonstrated on the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus using Loop-mediated isothermal amplification."
724,Factors associated with a prolonged negative conversion of viral RNA in patients with COVID-19.,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the factors influencing the delay in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA negative conversion. Methods: A cohort study was conducted that included patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the Tunisian national containment center. Follow-up consisted of a weekly RT-PCR test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors associated with negative RNA conversion. Results: Among the 264 patients included, the median duration of viral clearance was 20 days (interquartile range (IQR) 17-32 days). The shortest duration was 9 days and the longest was 58 days. Factors associated with negative conversion of viral RNA were symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and shortness of breath (hazard ratio (HR) 0.600, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.401-0.897) and face mask use when exposed to COVID-19 cases (HR 2.006, 95% CI 1.247-3.228). The median time to RNA viral conversion was 18 days (IQR 16-21 days) when using masks versus 23 days (IQR 17-36 days) without wearing masks, and 24 days (IQR 18-36 days) for symptomatic patients versus 20 days (IQR 16-30 days) for asymptomatic patients. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, having symptoms delayed viral clearance, while wearing masks accelerated this conversion. These factors should be taken into consideration for the strategy of isolating infected patients."
725,Prospects for mucosal vaccine: shutting the door on SARS-CoV-2.,"The sudden emergence of a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 from China and its rapid global spread has posed an international health emergency. The rapid development of an effective vaccine is imperative to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. A number of concurrent efforts to find an effective therapeutic agent or vaccine for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) are being undertaken globally. Oral and nasal mucosal surfaces serve as the primary portal of entry for pathogens like coronaviruses in the human body. As evidenced by studies on similar coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), mucosal vaccination can provide a safe and effective means for the induction of long-lasting systemic and mucosal immunity to confer protection against SARS-CoV-2. This article summarizes the approaches to an effective mucosal vaccine formulation which can be a rewarding approach to combat the unprecedented threat posed by this emerging global pandemic."

727,COVID-MATCH65-A prospectively derived clinical decision rule for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.,"Objectives: We report on the key clinical predictors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and present a clinical decision rule that can risk stratify patients for COVID-19. Design, participants and setting: A prospective cohort of patients assessed for COVID-19 at a screening clinic in Melbourne, Australia. The primary outcome was a positive COVID-19 test from nasopharyngeal swab. A backwards stepwise logistic regression was used to derive a model of clinical variables predictive of a positive COVID-19 test. Internal validation of the final model was performed using bootstrapped samples and the model scoring derived from the coefficients, with modelling performed for increasing prevalence. Results: Of 4226 patients with suspected COVID-19 who were assessed, 2976 patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing (n = 108 SARS-CoV-2 positive) and were used to determine factors associated with a positive COVID-19 test. The 7 features associated with a positive COVID-19 test on multivariable analysis were: COVID-19 patient exposure or international travel, Myalgia/malaise, Anosmia or ageusia, Temperature, Coryza/sore throat, Hypoxia-oxygen saturation < 97%, 65 years or older-summarized in the mnemonic COVID-MATCH65. Internal validation showed an AUC of 0.836. A cut-off of â‰¥ 1.5 points was associated with a 92.6% sensitivity and 99.5% negative predictive value (NPV) for COVID-19. Conclusions: From the largest prospective outpatient cohort of suspected COVID-19 we define the clinical factors predictive of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. The subsequent clinical decision rule, COVID-MATCH65, has a high sensitivity and NPV for SARS-CoV-2 and can be employed in the pandemic, adjusted for disease prevalence, to aid COVID-19 risk-assessment and vital testing resource allocation."
728,An Ultra-Rapid Real-Time RT-PCR Method Using the PCR1100 to Detect Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2.,"The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has rapidly spread worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is usually detected via real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the increase in specimen load in institutions/hospitals necessitates a simpler detection system. Here, we present an ultra-rapid, real-time RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection using PCR1100 device. Although PCR1100 tests only one specimen at a time, the amplification period is less than 20 min and the sensitivity and specificity match those of conventional real-time RT-PCR performed on large instruments. The method is potentially helpful when daily multiple SARS-CoV-2 testing is needed, for example to confirm virus-free status prior to patient discharge."
729,Pulmonary imaging in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a series of 140 Latin American children.,"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which resulted in the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of 2020, has particularly affected Latin America. Objective: The purpose of the study was to analyze the imaging findings of pulmonary COVID-19 in a large pediatric series. Materials and methods: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by either quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs or presence of circulating immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and who underwent chest radiograph or CT or both were included in this retrospective multicenter study. Three pediatric radiologists independently reviewed radiographs and CTs to identify the presence, localization, distribution and extension of pulmonary lesions. Results: We included 140 children (71 female; median age 6.3 years, interquartile range 1.6-12.1 years) in the study. Peribronchial thickening (93%), ground-glass opacities (79%) and vascular engorgement (63%) were the most frequent findings on 131 radiographs. Ground-glass opacities (91%), vascular engorgement (84%) and peribronchial thickening (72%) were the most frequent findings on 32 CTs. Peribronchial thickening (100%), ground-glass opacities (83%) and pulmonary vascular engorgement (79%) were common radiograph findings in asymptomatic children (n=25). Ground-glass opacity and consolidation were significantly higher in children who needed intensive care admission or died (92% and 48%), in contrast with children with a favorable outcome (71% and 24%, respectively; P<0.05). Conclusion: Asymptomatic children and those with mild symptoms of COVID-19 showed mainly peribronchial thickening, ground-glass opacities and pulmonary vascular engorgement on radiographs. Ground-glass opacity and consolidation were more common in children who required intensive care admission or died."
