9830,"Could ""trained immunity"" be induced by live attenuated vaccines protect against COVID-19? Review of available evidence.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a severe global public health threat. Caused by SARS-Cov-2, COVID-19 is characterized by high transmission rate that correlates with high viral load. The full clinical spectrum of the illness, the prevalence rates of mild symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and the case fatality rates are still poorly understood, highlighting the importance of early preventive measures. Unfortunately, appropriate vaccination against SARS-Cov-2 is not yet available. Unless a target vaccine is developed, COVID-19 impacts will be devastating. ""Trained immunity"" (TI), which could be induced by live attenuated vaccines (LAVs), is a potential public health preventive approach to boost the host immune system. Trained innate immune cells demonstrated phenotypical and functional changes leading them to acquire immunological memory and amplify their responses against subsequent infections. This phenomenon could have important public health preventive implications by harnessing the early immune responses against COVID-19, restricting its progression, and suppressing its infectivity. Some LAVs have induced a broad, nonspecific, protection against unrelated pathogens and decreased mortality from conditions other than the targeted infectious diseases. This review summarizes the relevant literature and 1) emphasizes the role of available LAVs as potential stimulants for TI and 2) proposes this phenomenon as a potential preventive approach against COVID-19 that needs thoughtful consideration and further investigation. Clinical trials in this field are then urgently needed in line of vaccine and treatment unavailability. This is specifically true when considering two evolving scenarios; the virus spread may not diminish with warm weather, and that it will erupt a second-hit severe outbreak next winter."
9831,"Hypoxia, HIF-1alpha, and COVID-19: from pathogenic factors to potential therapeutic targets.","The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become the greatest current threat to global public health. The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily attacks pulmonary tissues and impairs gas exchange leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic hypoxia. The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 largely rely on supportive and anti-thrombi treatment and the repurposing of antimalarial and antiviral drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. For a better mechanistic understanding of COVID-19, our present review focuses on its primary pathophysiologic features: hypoxia and cytokine storm, which are a prelude to multiple organ failure and lethality. We discussed a possible link between the activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, since HIF-1α is shown to suppress the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and upregulate disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17). In addition, the protein targets of HIF-1α are involved with the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and the subsequent inflammatory process. Furthermore, we hypothesized a potential utility of so-called ""hypoxic conditioning"" to activate HIF-1α-induced cytoprotective signaling for reduction of illness severity and improvement of vital organ function in patients with COVID-19. Taken together, we would propose further investigations into the hypoxia-related molecular mechanisms, from which novel targeted therapies can be developed for the improved management of COVID-19."
9832,Targeted wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 on a university campus for COVID-19 outbreak detection and mitigation.,"Targeted wastewater surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been proposed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Wastewater Surveillance System as a complementary approach to clinical surveillance to detect the presence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) at high-density facilities and institutions such as university campuses, nursing homes, and correctional facilities. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of targeted wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA together with individual-level testing for outbreak mitigation on a university campus during Fall 2020 semester. Wastewater samples (n = 117) were collected weekly from manholes or sewer cleanouts that receive wastewater inputs from dormitories, community-use buildings, and a COVID-19 isolation dormitory. Quantitative RT-PCR N1 and N2 assays were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid genes in wastewater. Due to varying human waste input in different buildings, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) RNA was also measured in all samples and used to normalize SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 RNA wastewater concentrations. In this study, temporal trends of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples mirrored trends in COVID-19 cases detected on campus. Normalizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations using human fecal indicator, PMMV enhanced the correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with COVID-19 cases. N1 and N2 genes were significant predictors of COVID-19 cases in dormitories, and the N2 gene was significantly correlated with the number of detected COVID-19 cases in dormitories. By implementing several public health surveillance programs include targeted wastewater surveillance, individual-level testing, contact tracing, and quarantine/isolation facilities, university health administrators could act decisively during an outbreak on campus, resulting in rapid decline of newly detected COVID-19 cases. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is a proactive outbreak monitoring tool for university campuses seeking to continue higher education practices in person during the COVID-19 pandemic."

9835,Persistence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the aerosol and on the surfaces.,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created havoc worldwide ever since its emergen-ce in December 2019. The current evidence indicates that the virus remains viable in aerosols for hours and on fomites for few days. A little information is available on the topic, the present communication reviews the perseverance and distribution of the novel coronavirus in the aerosol and on various inanimate surfaces so that the appropriate safety measures can be undertaken and the virus protection guidelines may be framed accordingly."
9836,Genetic variants and source of introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in South America.,"After more than 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemics with genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 around the globe, there are more than 1000 complete genomes of this virus. We used 691 genomes from the GISAID database. Several studies have been reporting mutations and hotspots according to viral evolution. Our work intends to show and compare positions that have variants in 30 complete viral genomes from South American countries. We classified strains according to point alterations and portray the source where strains came into this region. Most viruses entered South America from Europe, followed by Oceania. Only Chilean isolates demonstrated a relationship with Asian isolates. Some changes in South American genomes are near to specific domains related to viral replication or the S protein. Our work contributes to the global understanding of which sort of strains are spreading throughout South America, and the differences among them according to the first isolates introduced to this region."

Clusters included one in which patients attended the same social gathering and another that led to targeted testing and outreach."
9838,Using student-centered approaches to teach the biochemistry of SARS-CoV-2.,"A biochemistry class was transformed to implement student-centered, active-learning pedagogies to help improve competencies associated with the scientific method. In responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course content switched from the biochemistry of nucleic acids to the science of the newly discovered virus, SARS-CoV-2. This provided a unique opportunity to model authentic science inquiry through cycles of questioning, investigating, assessing, and critical thinking on a rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary topic. This learning experience helped enhance science literacy, supported self-directed learning and curiosity, and emphasized the importance of evaluating information sources to recognize misinformation."
9839,"Practitioners specialized in oral health and coronavirus disease 2019: Professional guidelines from the French society of stomatology, maxillofacial surgery and oral surgery, to form a common front against the infectious risk.","Medical as well as non-medical practitioners specialized in oral health are at high risk of infection with the Coronavirus-19 (Covid-19) because of the proximity with potentially infected biological fluids. This risk is permanent, especially during examination, care and transfer of patients. Regarding the pandemic progression of Covid-19, efficient protocols of prevention are urgently needed. Based on our experience and on the recently reported guidelines from the French National Agency for Public Health (ARS, March 5, 2020), the French Society of Hospital Hygiene (SFHH, March 4, 2020) and the Department of Infectious Risk Prevention of the Hospitals of Paris-Public Assistance (APHP, March 6, 2020), we provide several recommendations for practitioners specialized in oral health, to protect themselves from nosocomial infections, especially Covid-19."
