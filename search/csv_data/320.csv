3191,COVID-19: A review of therapeutic strategies and vaccine candidates.,"The world is engulfed by one of the most widespread and significant public health crises in decades as COVID-19 has become among the leading causes of death internationally. The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes COVID-19 has unified the scientific community in search of therapeutic and preventative solutions. The top priorities at the moment are twofold: first, to repurpose already-approved pharmacologic agents or develop novel therapies to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the ever-spreading virus. Secondly, the scientific and larger pharmaceutical community have been tasked with the development, testing, and production of a safe and effective vaccine as a longer-term solution to prevent further spread and recurrence throughout the populace. The purpose of this article is to review the most up-to-date published data regarding both the leading pharmacological therapies undergoing clinical trials and vaccine candidates in development to stem the threat of COVID-19."

3193,Comparable endemic coronavirus nucleoprotein-specific antibodies in mild and severe Covid-19 patients.,"The severity of disease of Covid-19 is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to critical respiratory disease and death. Potential cross-reactive immune responses between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronavirus (eCoV) may hypothetically contribute to this variability. We herein studied if eCoV nucleoprotein (N)-specific antibodies in the sera of patients with mild or severe Covid-19 are associated with Covid-19 severity. There were comparable levels of eCoV N-specific antibodies early and during the first month of infection in Covid-19 patients with mild and severe symptoms, and healthy SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects. These results warrant further studies to investigate the potential role of eCoV-specific antibodies in immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection."

3195,Isolation and genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian patients in a single family without H/O travel abroad.,"In view of the rapidly progressing COVID-19 pandemic, our aim was to isolate and characterize SARS-CoV-2 from Indian patients. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the two members of a family without any history of (H/O) travel abroad. Both the virus isolates (8003 and 8004) showed CPE on day 3 post-inoculation, viral antigens by immunofluorescence assay and produced distinct, clear and uniform plaques. Infectious virus titers were 5 × 106 and 4 × 106 Pfu/ml by plaque assay and 107.5 and 107 by CPE-based TCID50/ml, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis grouped our isolates with the Italian strains. On comparison with Wuhan strain, 3 unique mutations were identified in nsp3 (A1812D), exonuclease (P1821S) of Orf1ab and spike protein (Q677H) regions, respectively. Both the viruses grouped with Italian strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggesting possible source being the virus imported from Italy. These fully characterized virus isolates will be useful in developing neutralization/virological assays for the evaluation of vaccines/antivirals."
3196,Evaluation of Covid-19 vaccines: Pharmacoepidemiological aspects.,"The marketing authorization granted to SARS-Cov-2 vaccines was accompanied by reinforced safety monitoring plans. These plans' implementation was part of the usual logic of post-marketing surveillance of new and innovative health products. It was especially adapted to the context of post-marketing monitoring of drugs developed according to the usual scientific quality standards but in an accelerated schedule. In Europe, the reinforced surveillance system relies on the complementary strengths of pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. If the performances of pharmacovigilance monitoring are incomparable for the detection of safety signals relating to rare events of atypical presentation, it needs to be completed with pharmacoepidemiology activities for more common events, either multifactorial or frequently classified as idiopathic. The pharmacoepidemiological monitoring developed in Europe was elaborated before the first SARS-Cov-2 vaccines where marketed, taking into account the lessons learned from the vaccination campaign against 2009 A (H1N1) influenza. It includes numerous academic studies as well as studies performed within vaccines risk management plans. In terms of safety, those defined a priori mostly concerns a list of pre-established health events of specific interest. Aside of these planned activities, ad-hoc studies will be latter developed on purpose to investigate safety signals or potential signals that could be identified as the result of pharmacovigilance activities. Aside of these regulated activities, as for today, very few studies have been published regarding SARS-Cov-2 vaccines; most of the existing consist in preprints that should be considered with caution. Pharmacoepidemiology of vaccines is thought to allow near-real time monitoring that needs sufficient time to provide with valid results. In the constant urge for information that accompanies COVID-related science, it is important not to make haste the enemy of speed and to let pharmacoepidemiology provides with what it is expected to do: rock-solid scientific information contributing to evidence-based decision-making."
3197,Feasibility of the vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses using the shell disorder analysis.,"Several related viral shell disorder (disorder of shell proteins of viruses) models were built using a disorder predictor via AI. The parent model detected the presence of high levels of disorder at the outer shell in viruses, for which vaccines are not available. Another model found correlations between inner shell disorder and viral virulence. A third model was able to positively correlate the levels of respiratory transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs). These models are linked together by the fact that they have uncovered two novel immune evading strategies employed by the various viruses. The first involve the use of highly disordered ""shape-shifting"" outer shell to prevent antibodies from binding tightly to the virus thus leading to vaccine failure. The second usually involves a more disordered inner shell that provides for more efficient binding in the rapid replication of viral particles before any host immune response. This ""Trojan horse"" immune evasion often backfires on the virus, when the viral load becomes too great at a vital organ, which leads to death of the host. Just as such virulence entails the viral load to exceed at a vital organ, a minimal viral load in the saliva/mucus is necessary for respiratory transmission to be feasible. As for the SARS-CoV-2, no high levels of disorder can be detected at the outer shell membrane (M) protein, but some evidence of correlation between virulence and inner shell (nucleocapsid, N) disorder has been observed. This suggests that not only the development of vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, unlike HIV, HSV and HCV, is feasible but its attenuated vaccine strain can either be found in nature or generated by genetically modifying N."
3198,Evaluating the massive underreporting and undertesting of COVID-19 cases in multiple global epicenters.,"Background: With continuous global COVID-19 outbreak, differing case numbers and mortality rates are observed. While actual case numbers appear vague, mortality numbers related to COVID-19 seem more precise. In this study, we used the mortality rate as the main indicator to evaluate the extent of underreporting and underdetection of COVID-19 cases. Methods: We have analyzed all available data provided by the World Health Organization on the development of international COVID-19 cases and mortality numbers on March 17th, 2020. A crude case-fatality risk (cCFR) and adjusted case-fatality risk (aCFR) was calculated for China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Iran and the United States. Additionally, a fold-change (FC) was derived for each country. Results: The highest aCFR and FC were detected for Spain. Based on their FC values, an extremely high number of undetected COVID-19 cases was displayed in France, the United States, Italy and Spain. For these countries, our findings indicate a detection rate of only 1-2% of total actual COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Due to limited testing capacities, mortality numbers may serve as a better indicator for COVID-19 case spread in many countries. Our data indicate that countries like France, Italy, the United States, Iran and Spain have extremely high numbers of undetected and underreported cases. Differences in testing availability and capacity, containment as well as overall health care and medical infrastructure result in significantly different mortality rates and COVID-19 case numbers for each respective country."
