1700,Bullous drug eruption after second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine: Case report.,"Background: In December 2020, Moderna released the mRNA-1273 vaccine. The most common side effects are headache, muscle pain, redness, swelling, and tenderness at the injection site. In addition, there have been dermatological adverse events, such as hypersensitivity reactions. Although rare, various bullous eruptions have been described following vaccination. Bullous pemphigoid has been reported to occur most often after receipt of influenza and the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of bullous drug eruptions resulting from mRNA vaccines. Case summary: A 66-years-old obese Guyanese male presented with a bullous rash following receipt of a commercial COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. He received the first dose uneventfully. However, within 24 h of receiving the second dose, he developed fever, myalgias, and malaise accompanied by a painful blistering rash of his torso, arms, and legs. His fever and myalgias improved after 24 h, but his painful rash did not, and five days after the initial symptoms, he presented to the hospital. There were many violaceous, poorly demarcated patches on his trunk, arms, and thighs on examination, many of which had large flaccid bullae within, and a few areas on his buttocks, posterior shoulder, and scrotum were eroded. The exam was also significant for lower extremity muscle tenderness, stiffness with preserved strength. A skin biopsy showed epidermal necrosis and sparse perivascular dermatitis concerning Stevens-Johnson syndrome or erythema multiforme. However, in the absence of mucous membrane involvement or targetoid lesions, the diagnosis of an extensive bullous fixed drug eruption was made. Conclusion: This case illustrates that the bullae eruption occurred as a result of receiving the Moderna vaccination."
1701,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Saliva as Compared to Nasopharyngeal Swabs in Outpatients.,"Widely available and easily accessible testing for COVID-19 is a cornerstone of pandemic containment strategies. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the currently accepted standard for sample collection but are limited by their need for collection devices and sampling by trained healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of saliva to NPS in an outpatient setting. This was a prospective study conducted at three centers, which compared the performance of saliva and NPS samples collected at the time of assessment center visit. Samples were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sensitivity and overall agreement determined between saliva and NPS. Clinical data was abstracted by chart review for select study participants. Of the 432 paired samples, 46 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, with seven discordant observed between the two sample types (four individuals testing positive only by NPS and three by saliva only). The observed agreement was 98.4% (kappa coefficient 0.91) and a composite reference standard demonstrated sensitivity of 0.91 and 0.93 for saliva and NPS samples, respectively. On average, the Ct values obtained from saliva as compared to NPS were higher by 2.76. This study demonstrates that saliva performs comparably to NPS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Saliva was simple to collect, did not require transport media, and could be tested with equipment readily available at most laboratories. The use of saliva as an acceptable alternative to NPS could support the use of widespread surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2."
1702,Clinical performance and sample freeze-thaw stability of the cobas6800 SARS-CoV-2 assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in oro-/nasopharyngeal swabs and lower respiratory specimens.,"Introduction: Studies describing the performance characteristics of the cobas®6800 system for SARS-CoV-2 detection in deep respiratory specimens and freeze-thaw stability are limited. The current study compares the clinical performance of the automated SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas®6800 system to a lab-developed assay (LDA) and the cobas impact of freeze-thawing combined with lysis buffer. Methods: Both retrospective and prospectively selected deep respiratory samples and oro- and nasopharyngeal samples in either E-swab® or GLY- were tested using the SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas®6800 System and compared to a lab developed assay. Additonally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA stability was assessed after one freeze-thaw cycle with or without lysis buffer. Results: In total, 221 (58.3 %) oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, 131 (34.6 %) deep respiratory specimens, and n = 25 (6.6 %) swabs of unknown origin were included to study clinical performance. Only 4 samples gave discrepant results, all being positive in the LDA and not the cobas®6800 system. For stability testing, 66 samples without and 110 with lysis buffer were included. No clinically significant difference was found in test results after one freeze-thaw cycle and addition of lysis buffer. Conclusion: Based on our findings, the cobas®6800 SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay yielded similar results as the LDA in oro-/nasopharyngeal swabs and deep respiratory specimens. Moreover, the cobas®6800 SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay yielded similar results before and after a freeze-thaw cycle, with better preservation of low viral loads in lysis buffer."
1703,Neutralization of Beta and Delta variant with sera of COVID-19 recovered cases and vaccinees of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine BBV152/Covaxin.,"SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern mainly Delta and Beta is global public health concern due to its impact on existing vaccines. Here, we assessed the neutralization of sera from COVID-19 recovered cases and BBV152 vaccinees against Beta and Delta variants. BBV152 vaccine found to confer significant protection against both the variants."
1704,Heat inactivation decreases the qualitative real-time RT-PCR detection rates of clinical samples with high cycle threshold values in COVID-19.,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused COVID-19 pandemic globally in the beginning of 2020, and qualitative real-time RT-PCR has become the gold standard in diagnosis. As SARSCoV-2 with strong transmissibility and pathogenicity, it has become a professional consensus that clinical samples from suspected patients should be heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min before further processing. However, previous studies on the effect of inactivation on qualitative real-time RT-PCR were conducted with diluted samples rather than clinical samples. The aim of this study was to investigate whether heat inactivation on clinical samples before detection will affect the accuracy of qualitative real-time RT-PCR detection. All 46 throat swab samples from 46 confirmed inpatients were detected by qualitative real-time RT-PCR directly, as well as after heat inactivation. Heat-Inactivation has significantly influenced the qualitative detection results on clinical samples, especially weakly positive samples. The results indicate the urgency to establish a more suitable protocol for COVID-19 clinical sample's inactivation."
1705,Designing of a next generation multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2: Immunoinformatics and in silico approaches.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a significant threat to global health security. Till date, no completely effective drug or vaccine is available to cure COVID-19. Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is crucially needed. This study was conducted to design an effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven highly antigenic proteins of SARS-COV-2 were selected as targets and different epitopes (B-cell and T-cell) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.93% coverage of the world's population. Hence, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting 16 MHC class I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible. Furthermore, molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses, demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR8. Finally, MEV codons were optimized for its in silico cloning into Escherichia coli K-12 system, to ensure its increased expression. Designed MEV in present study could be a potential candidate for further vaccine production process against COVID-19. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed MEV needs to be experimentally validated."
1706,Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Current Status and Prospects for Drug and Vaccine Development.,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to almost all nooks and corners of the world. There are numerous potential approaches to pharmacologically fight COVID-19: small-molecule drugs, interferon therapies, vaccines, oligonucleotides, peptides, and monoclonal antibodies. Medications are being developed to target the spike, membrane, nucleocapsid or envelope proteins. The spike protein is also a critical target for vaccine development. Immunoinformatic approaches are being used for the identification of B cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Different vaccine vectors are also being developed. Chemical and physical methods such as formaldehyde, UV light or β-propiolactone are being deployed for the preparation of inactivated virus vaccine. Currently, there are many vaccines undergoing clinical trials. Even though mRNA and DNA vaccines are being designed and moved into clinical trials, these types of vaccines are yet to be approved by regulatory bodies for human use. This review focuses on the drugs and vaccines being developed against the COVID-19."
1707,Pregnant women's perspectives on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine.,"Background: Since coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines have been distributed, a debate has raised on whether pregnant women should get the vaccine. No available data exist so far regarding the safety, efficacy, and toxicology of these vaccines when administered during pregnancy. Most of the Obstetrics and Gynecology societies suggested that pregnant could agree to be vaccinated, after a thorough counseling of risks and benefits with their gynecologists, thus leading to an autonomous decision. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the attitude to coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination in pregnant and breastfeeding women in Italy. Study design: A survey was made at the University of Naples Federico II and the Ospedale Cristo Re, Tor Vergata University of Rome, on pregnant and breastfeeding women asking their perspectives on the available vaccines after reading the recommendations issued by our national Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Neonatology societies. The questionnaire included 12 items finalized to evaluate general features of the women and 6 items specifically correlated to their attitudes toward the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare group differences of categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed rank or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Naples Federico II (ref. no. 409/2020) and the Ospedale Cristo Re, Tor Vergata University of Rome (ref. #Ost4-2020). Results: Most of the included women did not agree to eventually receive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine during pregnancy (40 [28.2%] vs 102 [71.8%]). Being pregnant was considered a determinant factor to refuse the vaccine prophylaxis (99 [69.7%] vs 43 [30.3%]; chi-square test=24.187; P<.001), even if a very large percentage declared to be generally in favor of vaccines (128 [90.1%] vs 14 [9.9%]; chi-square test=6.091; P=.014) and most of them confirmed they received or would receive other recommended vaccines during pregnancy (75 [52.8%] vs 67 [47.2%]; chi-square test=10.996; P=.001). Conclusion: Urgent data are needed on the safety, efficacy, and toxicology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines during pregnancy to modify this trend and to help obstetricians during the counseling. Furthermore, pregnant women should be included in future vaccine development trials to not incur again in such uncertainty."
