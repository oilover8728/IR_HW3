631,Performance of three polymerase chain reaction-based assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different upper respiratory tract specimens.,"To meet the testing demands and overcome supply chain issues during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many clinical laboratories validated multiple SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing platforms. Here, we compare three different molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 that received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In order to determine the agreement among Roche cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test (Cobas), Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (ART), and Mayo Clinic Laboratory SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection Assay (Mayo LDT), 100 each of anterior nares (AN), nasopharyngeal (NP), oropharyngeal (OP), and NP+OP swabs were tested on each platform. The consensus result was defined as agreement by 2 or more methods. Furthermore, 30 positive NP swabs from each molecular platform (n = 90 total) were tested on the three platforms to determine the PPA among positive samples. ART platform called more specimens positive than the other two platforms. All three assays performed with greater than 90% agreement for NP specimens throughout the study."
632,SARS-CoV-2 N gene dropout and N gene Ct value shift as indicator for the presence of B.1.1.7 lineage in a commercial multiplex PCR assay.,"Objectives: Detection and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is of eminent importance, particularly due to the rapid emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). In this study we evaluated if a commercially available quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay can identify SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage samples by a specific N gene dropout or Ct value shift compared with the S or RdRp gene. Methods: VOC B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2-positive patient samples were identified via whole-genome sequencing and variant-specific PCR. Confirmed B.1.1.7 (n = 48) and non-B.1.1.7 samples (n = 58) were analysed using the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV™ PCR assay for presence of SARS-CoV-2 S, RdRp and N genes. The N gene coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with and without the D3L mutation (specific for B.1.1.7) was cloned into pCR™II-TOPO™ vectors to validate polymorphism-dependent N gene dropout with the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV™ PCR assay. Results: All studied B.1.1.7-positive patient samples showed significantly higher Ct values in qRT-PCR (Δ6-10, N gene dropout on Ct values > 29) of N gene than the corresponding values of S (p ≤ 0.0001) and RdRp (p ≤ 0.0001) genes. The assay reliably discriminated B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 positive samples (area under the curve = 1) in a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Identical Ct value shifts (Δ7-10) were detected in reverse genetic experiments, using isolated plasmids containing N gene coding sequences corresponding to D3 or 3L variants. Discussion: An N gene dropout or Ct value shift is shown for B.1.1.7-positive samples in the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV™ PCR assay. This approach can be used as a rapid tool for B.1.1.7 detection in single assay high throughput diagnostics."

634,Prevention of the spread of SARS COV-2 by Rapid Antigenic Tests on the passengers entering an Italian seaport.,"Out of 38,282 passengers entering Italy at a major seaport, submitted to SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigenic test, 272 (0.6%) resulted positive and 212 (93.4%) were confirmed positive by qRT-PCR, leaving a 0.6% of false positive. Those resident in the area under control of the same Local Health Authority of the seaport were immediately submitted to isolation and investigated for contact tracing, the others notified to their Local Health Authority which did the same in the following day. This procedure was made possible by a full-time dedication of the local healthcare workers who managed all the passengers disembarking around the clock along the months of the emergency."
635,"Comparison of four high-throughput, automated immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Background: A number of immunoassays have been developed to measure antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2. More data is required on their comparability, particularly among those with milder infections and in the general practice population. The aim of this study was to compare four high-throughput automated anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays using samples collected from hospitalized patients and healthcare workers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we collected general practice samples to compare antibody results and determine seroprevalence. Methods: Samples were collected from 57 hospitalized patients and nine healthcare workers at 14 days and at 28 days following confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were also collected from 225 patients presenting to general practice. Four assays were used: Abbott Architect IgG, Beckman Coulter DxI 800 IgG, Roche Cobas e801 total antibody and Siemens Advia Centaur XPT total antibody. Results: All four assays showed concordance at 14 days in 83.9% of hospitalized patients and in 66.7% of healthcare workers. All four assays showed concordance at 28 days in 88.4% of hospitalized patients and 77.8% of healthcare workers. The sensitivity to detect recent infection was higher for the IgG assays than the total assays. All four assays showed concordance of 95.1% in the general practice population. Seroprevalence ranged from 4.9 to 5.8% depending on the assay used. Conclusions: All four assays showed excellent comparability, but it may be possible to obtain a negative result for any of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays in patients with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. An equivocal range would be useful for all anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays."
636,Resource-efficient internally controlled in-house real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: The reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 has become one of the most important contributions to COVID-19 crisis management. With the publication of the first sequences of SARS-CoV-2, several diagnostic PCR assays have been developed and published. In addition to in-house assays the market was flooded with numerous commercially available ready-to-use PCR kits, with both approaches showing alarming shortages in reagent supply. Aim: Here we present a resource-efficient in-house protocol for the PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient specimens (RKI/ZBS1 SARS-CoV-2 protocol). Methods: Two duplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assays are run simultaneously and provide information on two different SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions. Each one is duplexed with a control that either indicates potential PCR inhibition or proves the successful extraction of nucleic acid from the clinical specimen. Results: Limit of RNA detection for both SARS-CoV-2 assays is below 10 genomes per reaction. The protocol enables testing specimens in duplicate across the two different SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays, saving reagents by increasing testing capacity. The protocol can be run on various PCR cyclers with several PCR master mix kits. Conclusion: The presented RKI/ZBS1 SARS-CoV-2 protocol represents a cost-effective alternative in times of shortages when commercially available ready-to-use kits may not be available or affordable."
637,Functionalized terahertz plasmonic metasensors: Femtomolar-level detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.,"Effective and efficient management of human betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus infection i.e., COVID-19 pandemic, required sensitive and selective sensors with short sample-to-result durations for performing desired diagnostics. In this direction, one appropriate alternative approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus protein at low level i.e., femtomolar (fM) is exploring plasmonic metasensor technology for COVID-19 diagnostics, which offers exquisite opportunities in advanced healthcare programs, and modern clinical diagnostics. The intrinsic merits of plasmonic metasensors stem from their capability to squeeze electromagnetic fields, simultaneously in frequency, time, and space. However, the detection of low-molecular weight biomolecules at low densities is a typical drawback of conventional metasensors that has recently been addressed using toroidal metasurface technology. This research is focused on the fabrication of a miniaturized plasmonic immunosensor based on toroidal electrodynamics concept that can sustain robustly confined plasmonic modes with ultranarrow lineshapes in the terahertz (THz) frequencies. By exciting toroidal dipole mode using our quasi-infinite metasurface and a judiciously optimized protocol based on functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with the specific monoclonal antibody specific to spike protein (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 virus onto the metasurface, the resonance shifts for diverse concentrations of the spike protein are monitored. Possessing molecular weight around ~76 kDa allowed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus protein with significantly low as limit of detection (LoD) was achieved as ~4.2 fM. We envisage that outcomes of this research will pave the way toward the use of toroidal metasensors as practical technologies for rapid and precise screening of SARS-CoV-2 virus carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, and spike proteins in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and site of infection."
638,"Validation of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 antigen test in Vojvodina, Serbia.","Background: Since COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis, tests with high sensitivity and specificity are crucial for the identification and management of COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need for low-cost rapid antigen COVID-19 test with a good diagnostic performance. Although various antigen rapid detection tests are widely available, strong evidence of their usefulness in clinical practice are still limited. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate clinical performance of STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test (SD Biosensor, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea). Methods: The performance of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen was evaluated in comparison to RT-qPCR results in 120 symptomatic patients (median age 49, IQR 36-70) who presented to health care facility in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia. Results: Twenty five out of 120 samples have been tested positive using STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test, and all of them were also positive on RT-qPCR. Overall, the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test showed sensitivity of 58.1% (95% CI 42.1-73.0) but it was higher in the early days of disease, when the highest viral loads were detected. During the first five days after the symptom onset, the sensitivity ranged from 66.7% to 100% and the pooled accuracy and Kappa values were high (0.92 and 0.852). Conclusions: A strong agreement between performance of STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test and RT-qPCR was observed during the first five days of illness, suggesting that this rapid antigenic test can be very useful for COVID-19 diagnosis in the early phase of disease."
639,Targets and assay types for COVID-19 diagnosis.,"The lack of complete information on the immune response dynamics to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the use of mainly molecular tests such as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to diagnose Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). Although remarkable progress has been made in developing effective RT-PCR kits, the lack of specific equipment required to perform this technique in all clinical laboratories limits its widespread use. In the case of COVID-19, these tests can be used for the triage of symptomatic patients, for testing the contacts of confirmed cases, and also for the analysis and monitoring of the situation. Along with molecular tests involving reverse transcription PCR, various laboratory tests can identify the specific anti-viral antibodies or viral antigens. This review seeks to describe the targets and diagnostic methods available or currently in development for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), serologic immunoassays (SIA) and the protein microarray method (PMM). Knowing the specific targets and the sensitivity of each assay used for COVID-19 diagnosis can lead to more efficient detection of infected patients and it can provide better management of the pandemic status."
