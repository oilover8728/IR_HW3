7690,Potential for developing a SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein as a heterologous human vaccine against coronavirus infectious disease (COVID)-19.,"A SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein was developed and manufactured under current good manufacturing practices in 2016. The protein, known as RBD219-N1 when formulated on Alhydrogel®, induced high-level neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity with minimal immunopathology in mice after a homologous virus challenge with SARS-CoV (MA15 strain). We examined published evidence in support of whether the SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 could be repurposed as a heterologous vaccine against Coronavirus Infectious Disease (COVID)-19. Our findings include evidence that convalescent serum from SARS-CoV patients can neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a review of published studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against SARS-CoV RBD and that neutralizes the SARS-CoV virus in vitro finds that some of these mAbs bind to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the RBD, while others bind to domains outside this region within RBD. This information is relevant and supports the possibility of developing a heterologous SARS-CoV RBD vaccine against COVID-19, especially due to the finding that the overall high amino acid similarity (82%) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD domains is not reflected in RBM amino acid similarity (59%). However, the high sequence similarity (94%) in the region outside of RBM offers the potential of conserved neutralizing epitopes between both viruses."

7692,Pooling of SARS-CoV-2 samples to increase molecular testing throughput.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 testing demand has outpaced its supply. Pooling samples for lower risk populations has the potential to accommodate increased demand for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. Objective: To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of 4-way pooling of SARS-CoV-2 specimens for high-throughput RT-PCR. Study design: Individual samples were pooled 1:4 through automated liquid handling, extracted, and assayed by our emergency use authorized CDC-based RT-PCR laboratory developed test. Positive samples were serially diluted and theoretical and empirical PCR cycle thresholds were evaluated. Thirty-two distinct positive samples were pooled into negative specimens and individual CTs were compared to pooled CTs. Low positive samples were repeated for reproducibility and 32 four-way pools of negative specimens were assayed to determine specificity. Results: Four-way pooling was associated with a loss of sensitivity of 1.7 and 2.0 CTs for our N1 and N2 targets, respectively. Pooling correctly identified SARS-CoV-2 in 94 % (n = 30/32) of samples tested. The two low positive specimens (neat CT > 35) not detected by pooling were individually repeated and detected 75 % (n=6/8) and 37.5 % (n = 3/8) of the time, respectively. All specimens individually determined negative were also negative by pooling. Conclusion: We report that 1:4 pooling of samples is specific and associated with an expected 2 CT loss in analytical sensitivity. Instead of running each sample individually, pooling of four samples will allow for a greater throughput and conserve scarce reagents."
7693,Containing pandemics through targeted testing of households.,"Background: While invasive social distancing measures have proven efficient to control the spread of pandemics failing wide-scale deployment of vaccines, they carry vast societal costs. The development of a diagnostic methodology for identifying COVID-19 infection through simple testing was a reality only a few weeks after the novel virus was officially announced. Thus, we were interested in exploring the ability of regular testing of non-symptomatic people to reduce cases and thereby offer a non-pharmaceutical tool for controlling the spread of a pandemic. Methods: We developed a data-driven individual-based epidemiological network model in order to investigate epidemic countermeasures. This models is based on high-resolution demographic data for each municipality in Norway, and each person in the model is subject to Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) dynamics. The model was calibrated against hospitalization data in Oslo, Norway, a city with a population of 700k which we have used as the simulations focus. Results: Finding that large households function as hubs for the propagation of COVID-19, we assess the intervention efficiency of targeted pooled household testing (TPHT) repeatedly. For an outbreak with reproductive number R=1.4, we find that weekly TPHT of the 25% largest households brings R below unity. For the case of R=1.2, our results suggest that TPHT with the largest 25% of households every three days in an urban area is as effective as a lockdown in curbing the outbreak. Our investigations of different disease parameters suggest that these results are markedly improved for disease variants that more easily infect young people, and when compliance with self-isolation rules is less than perfect among suspected symptomatic cases. These results are quite robust to changes in the testing frequency, city size, and the household-size distribution. Our results are robust even with only 50% of households willing to participate in TPHT, provided the total number of tests stay unchanged. Conclusions: Pooled and targeted household testing appears to be a powerful non-pharmaceutical alternative to more invasive social-distancing and lock-down measures as a localized early response to contain epidemic outbreaks."
7694,Anterior uveitis onset after bnt162b2 vaccination: is this just a coincidence?,"Background: Uveitis is a vision-threatening inflammation and is considered an ophthalmic emergency. It generally arises as a result of autoimmune conditions, infections, or ocular trauma, but it may also occur as an isolated disorder. Over the past decades, several cases of vaccine-associated uveitis have been described, with the hepatitis B virus vaccine being the leading cause. Clinical case: A case of anterior uveitis in a 23-year-old male, with onset 14 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine, is reported here. Initial symptoms were pain, photophobia, and red eye. Ocular examination showed pericheratic and conjunctival hyperaemia, posterior synechiae, and anterior chamber cells ± keratic precipitates in the lower quadrants. The posterior segment did not show any alteration, and optical coherence tomography ruled out the presence of cystoid macular oedema. After a 10-day treatment course of topical steroids and cycloplegic eye drops, the ocular inflammatory signs disappeared and visual acuity was completely restored. Even if causality remains presumed, a warning should be given to physicians about the possibility of eye inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination."
7695,"Study of a SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in a Belgian Military Education and Training Center in Maradi, Niger.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compromises the ability of military forces to fulfill missions. At the beginning of May 2020, 22 out of 70 Belgian soldiers deployed to a military education and training center in Maradi, Niger, developed mild COVID-19 compatible symptoms. Immediately upon their return to Belgium, and two weeks later, all seventy soldiers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-qPCR) and antibodies (two immunoassays). Nine soldiers had at least one positive COVID-19 diagnostic test result. Five of them exhibited COVID-19 symptoms (mainly anosmia, ageusia, and fever), while four were asymptomatic. In four soldiers, SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected and the genomes were sequenced. Conventional and genomic epidemiological data suggest that these genomes have an African most recent common ancestor and that the Belgian military service men were infected through contact with locals. The medical military command implemented testing of all Belgian soldiers for SARS-CoV-2 viral load and antibodies, two to three days before their departure on a mission abroad or on the high seas, and for specific missions immediately upon their return in Belgium. Some military operational settings (e.g., training camps in austere environments and ships) were also equipped with mobile infectious disease (COVID-19) testing capacity."
7696,A scoping review of the experience of implementing population testing for SARS-CoV-2.,"Objectives: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - also known as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) - pandemic has led to the swift introduction of population testing programmes in many countries across the world, using testing modalities such as drive-through, walk-through, mobile and home visiting programmes. Here, we provide an overview of the literature describing the experience of implementing population testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Study design: Scoping review. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library in addition to a grey literature search. We identified indicators relevant to process, quality and resource outcomes related to each testing modality. Results: In total, 2999 titles were identified from the academic literature and the grey literature search, of which 22 were relevant. Most studies were from the USA and the Republic of Korea. Drive-through testing centres were the most common testing modality evaluated and these provided a rapid method of testing whilst minimising resource use. Conclusions: The evidence base for population testing lacks high quality studies, however, the literature provides evaluations of the advantages and limitations of different testing modalities. There is a need for robust evidence in this area to ensure that testing is deployed in a safe and effective manner in response to the COVID-19 pandemic."
7697,First case of convalescent plasma transfusion in a child with COVID-19-associated severe aplastic anemia.,"We present the case of a six-year-old girl with severe COVID-19, in whom SARS-CoV-2 was successfully eliminated after convalescent plasma transfusion. Children show a variable clinical course of COVID-19, from asymptomatic to critical. In our patient, we diagnosed COVID-19-associated aplastic anemia with severe pancytopenia. The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection with aplastic anemia remains unclear. At the beginning of the disease, we used antiviral drugs and immune modulators as therapy but without any positive results. After providing a transfusion of convalescent plasma, the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 was observed. We did not observe any adverse events of this treatment. The girl still has a diagnosis of aplastic anemia and requires specialist therapy."
7698,"Viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 over the preclinical, clinical, and postclinical period.","Background: It is necessary to know the viral kinetics and conduct epidemiological investigations of confirmers to prevent the spread of the new infectious disease COVID-19 to the community. To date, no study has been published on viral kinetics during the preclinical and clinical periods of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A confirmed case was defined as a patient with positive results by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2. Both specimen types were collected over the whole clinical course in all patients. Asymptomatic patients who had been screened for COVID-19 due to a strong epidemiological link were also enrolled. The study population included 54 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. Results: COVID-19 shows a very high viral load on the day of symptom development, which then decreases overall. Rapid viral proliferation was observed 0-5 days before symptoms developed. Cycle threshold (Ct) value was the lowest in the clinical course from 5 days before symptoms to 10 days after symptoms occurred (Ct < 30). The rRT-PCR results were negative approximately 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. However, there was a continuous pattern that was negative and positive for up to 6 weeks and more. Conclusion: Considering the characteristic that COVID-19 has a high viral load before symptoms appear, it is necessary to consider to expand the scope of epidemiological investigations. As there is a very low possibility of transmission after 10 days of symptom occurrence, it may be considered to release isolation after 10 days of symptom occurrence in limited resource situations. This study allows for the planning of epidemiological investigations, patient's ward supply, and follow-up of patients through sequential changes in viral loads over the entire clinical course. In addition, it is possible to estimate the clinical time at which the patient is present."
7699,"SARS-CoV-2 in the environment: Modes of transmission, early detection and potential role of pollutions.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally having a profound effect on lives of millions of people, causing worldwide economic disruption. Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic."
