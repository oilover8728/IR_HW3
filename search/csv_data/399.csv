3980,COVID-19 vaccination intention and influencing factors among different occupational risk groups: a cross-sectional study.,"As an effective measure to manage the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and understanding the influencing factors of vaccination intention is particularly important. This study aimed to describe the COVID-19 vaccination intention among three different occupational risk groups and identify influencing factors of vaccination intention since a COVID-19 vaccine is available in China. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted from January 10 to February 5, 2021 in Hangzhou city of Zhejiang Province, an eastern coastal province in China. The intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination and health beliefs based on the Health Belief Model were collected. Of the participants, college students reported the lowest COVID-19 vaccination intention (64.6%), followed by public transportation workers (72.4%) and health care workers (79.9%). Perceived barriers were identified as negative factors of vaccination intention among all three occupational groups. For college students and public transportation workers, perceived benefits and cues to action were identified as protective factors, and cues to action had a positive effect on vaccination intention of health care workers. Tailored interventions are encouraged to reduce barriers of vaccination, improve health beliefs and promote COVID-19 vaccination intentions."
3981,A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Demographic and Behavioral Risk Factors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Seropositivity Among a Sample of U.S. College Students.,"Purpose: Colleges and universities across the United States are developing and implementing data-driven prevention and containment measures against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Identifying risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity could help to direct these efforts. This study aimed to estimate the associations between demographic factors and social behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test. Methods: In September 2020, we randomly sampled Indiana University Bloomington undergraduate students. Participants completed a cross-sectional online survey about demographics, SARS-CoV-2 testing history, relationship status, and risk behaviors. Additionally, during a subsequent appointment, participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a fingerstick procedure and SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid assay kit. We used unadjusted modified Poisson regression models to evaluate the associations between predictors of both SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 infection history. Results: Overall, 1,076 students were included in the serological testing analysis, and 1,239 students were included in the SARS-CoV-2 infection history analysis. Current seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 4.6% (95% confidence interval: 3.3%, 5.8%). Prevalence of self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection history was 10.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.6%, 12.0%). Greek membership, having multiple romantic partners, knowing someone in one's immediate environment with SARS-CoV-2 infection, drinking alcohol more than 1 day a week, and hanging out with more than five people when drinking alcohol increased both the likelihood of seropositivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection history. Conclusion: Our findings have implications for American colleges and universities and could be used to inform SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control strategies on such campuses."

3983,SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays in serial samples reveal earlier seroconversion in acutely ill COVID-19 patients developing ARDS.,"Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing has been suggested for (1) screening populations for disease prevalence, (2) diagnostics, and (3) guiding therapeutic applications. Here, we conducted a detailed clinical evaluation of four Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in samples from acutely ill COVID-19 patients and in two negative cohorts. Methods: 443 serum specimens from serial sampling of 29 COVID-19 patients were used to determine clinical sensitivities. Patients were stratified for the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Individual serum specimens from a pre-COVID-19 cohort of 238 healthy subjects and from a PCR-negative clinical cohort of 257 patients were used to determine clinical specificities. All samples were measured side-by-side with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgG), Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun AG, LÃ¼beck, Germany) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Results: Median seroconversion occurred earlier in ARDS patients (8-9 days) than in non-ARDS patients (11-17 days), except for EUR N-IgG. Rates of positivity and mean signal ratios in the ARDS group were significantly higher than in the non-ARDS group. Sensitivities between the four tested immunoassays were equivalent. In the set of negative samples, the specificity of the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) was lower (93.9%) compared to all other assays (â‰¥98.8%) and the specificity of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) was lower (98.8%) than that of Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%). Conclusions: Serial sampling in COVID-19 patients revealed earlier seroconversion and higher signal ratios of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as a potential risk marker for the development of ARDS, suggesting a utility for antibody testing in acutely diseased patients."
3984,Ontological Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Roll out Strategies: A Comparison of India and the United States of America.,"The unprecedented outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to devise national strategies to curtail its spread. The present study analyzes the national strategies of India and the United States for the COVID-19 vaccine roll out. The paper presents an ontology of COVID-19 vaccine roll out, maps the national strategies, identifies, analyzes the emphases and gaps in them, and proposes corrections to the same. The analysis shows that the national strategies are selective in their focus and siloed in their approach. They must be systematized to address the emerging challenges effectively. Thus, there is need for a systemic understanding and analysis to reinforce the effective pathways to manage vaccine roll out, reposition the ineffective ones, and engineer new ones through feedback and learning."
3985,Clinical and CT features of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 cases after two sequential negative nucleic acid testing results: a retrospective analysis.,"Background: The clinical and imaging features of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that progressed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been explored in numerous studies. However, little is known about these features in patients who received negative respiratory nucleic acid test results after the infections resolved. In this study, we aim to describe these features in a group of Chinese patients. Methods: This retrospective study includes 51 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (median age: 34.0 years and 47.1% male) between January 31 and February 28, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) imaging data were collected before and after two consecutive negative respiratory SARS-CoV-2 tests. Results: Following a negative test result, the patients' clinical symptoms continued to recover, but abnormal imaging findings were observed in all moderate cases. Specifically, 77.4% of patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited multi-lobar lung involvement and lesions were more frequently observed in the lower lobes. The most common CT imaging manifestations were ground-glass opacities (51.6%) and fibrous stripes (54.8%%). Twelve of the 31 patients with moderate COVID-19 underwent repeated chest CT scans after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test. Among them, the ground-glass opacities decreased by > 60% within 1 week in seven patients (58.3%), but by < 5% in four patients (13.8%). Conclusions: Following a positive and subsequent negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, patients with COVID-19 continued to recover despite exhibiting persistent clinical symptoms and abnormal imaging findings."
3986,"COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance in a Sample From the United Arab Emirates General Adult Population: A Cross-Sectional Survey, 2020.","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a tremendous stress on economies and healthcare systems worldwide. Having a vaccine is one of the promising solutions. However, vaccination hesitancy is becoming a recognized future challenge. This study aims to evaluate the current vaccine hesitancy in a segment of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) general public and its associated factors. Methods: This was an online cross-sectional survey that took place from the 14th to the 19th of September 2020 across the UAE. The questionnaire asked the participants about their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the future. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between vaccination willingness and the participants' sociodemographic factors, experiences and beliefs regarding COVID-19, and previous influenza vaccine uptake. Results: There was a total of 2,705 participants; 72.5% were females, and 69.8% were Emirati nationals. A total of 1,627 (60.1%) participants were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine in the future. There were statistically significant associations between the following factors and vaccine acceptance: male gender, non-Emiratis, younger age group, residents of Sharjah and the Northern Emirates, having lesser educational attainment, perceived increased personal or public risk of contracting the disease [aOR = 1.71, 95% CI (1.35-2.17), p < 0.0001; aOR = 1.84, 95% CI (1.44-2.36), p < 0.0001, respectively], and increased perception of serious outcome from the disease. Conversely, vaccine hesitancy was associated with unemployment, not receiving the influenza vaccine within the past 2 years [aOR = 0.36, 95% CI (0.30-0.44), p < 0.0001], not believing in the seriousness of the COVID-19 situation or the vaccine's ability to control the pandemic, and not believing that the public authorities are handling the pandemic adequately. Having contracted the disease or knowing someone who has did not show a statistically significant association with vaccine acceptance. Vaccine safety, side effects, and the belief that one needs to develop immunity naturally were the top reasons for vaccination hesitancy. Conclusion: Given the level of vaccine hesitancy in the study population, this needs to be evaluated in a more representative sample of the whole population. If confirmed, this would signify the need for coordinated local and international initiatives to combat vaccine misinformation and reassure the public regarding vaccine safety and efficacy."

3988,Community Testing and SARS-CoV-2 Rates for Latinxs in Baltimore.,"Introduction: Latinxs have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Latinx immigrants, in particular, face significant barriers to SARS-CoV-2 testing, including lack of insurance, language barriers, stigma, work conflicts, and limited transportation. Methods: In response to a disproportionately high SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate among Latinxs at the Johns Hopkins Health System, investigators implemented free community-based testing by partnering with religious leaders and leveraging the skill of trusted community health workers. Data were extracted from the electronic health record and a Research Electronic Data Capture database. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was evaluated per event stratified by race/ethnicity. Total rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and categorical patient characteristics were compared between groups using chi-square tests. Results: Between June 25, 2020 and October 15, 2020, a total of 1,786 patients (57.5% Latinx, 31.2% non-Hispanic White, 5.9% non-Hispanic Black, and 5.3% non-Hispanic other) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in 18 testing events. Among them, 355 (19.9%) tested positive. The positivity rate was 31.5% for Latinxs, 7.6% for non-Hispanic Blacks, 3.4% for non-Hispanic Whites, and 5.3% for patients of other races/ethnicities. Compared with Latinxs who tested negative, Latinxs who tested positive were more likely to report Spanish as their preferred language (91.6% vs 81.7%, p<0.001), be younger (30.4 vs 33.4 years, p<0.008), and have a larger household size (4.8 vs 4.3 members, p<0.002). Conclusions: Community-based testing identified high levels of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission among primarily Latinxs with limited English proficiency. During this period, the overall positivity rate at this community testing site was almost 10 times higher among Latinxs than among non-Hispanic Whites."
3989,The Impact of Structural Inequities on Older Asian Americans During COVID-19.,"Structural racism manifests as an historical and continued invisibility of Asian Americans, whose experiences of disparities and diverse needs are omitted in research, data, and policy. During the pandemic, this invisibility intersects with rising anti-Asian violence and other persistent structural inequities that contribute to higher COVID-19 mortality in older Asian Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites. This perspective describes how structural inequities in social determinants of health-namely immigration, language and telehealth access, and economic conditions-lead to increased COVID-19 mortality and barriers to care among older Asian Americans. Specifically, we discuss how the historically racialized immigration system has patterned older Asian immigrant subpopulations into working in frontline essential occupations with high COVID-19 exposure. The threat of ""public charge"" rule has also prevented Asian immigrants from receiving eligible public assistance including COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs. We highlight the language diversity among older Asian Americans and how language access remains unaddressed in clinical and non-clinical services and creates barriers to routine and COVID-19 related care, particularly in geographic regions with small Asian American populations. We discuss the economic insecurity of older Asian immigrants and how co-residence in multigenerational homes has exposed them to greater risk of coronavirus transmission. Using an intersectionality-informed approach to address structural inequities, we recommend the disaggregation of racial/ethnic data, meaningful inclusion of older Asian Americans in research and policy, and equitable investment in community and multi-sectoral partnerships to improve health and wellbeing of older Asian Americans."
