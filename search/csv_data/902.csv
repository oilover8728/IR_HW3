9010,Quasi-species nature and differential gene expression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and phylogenetic analysis of a novel Iranian strain.,"A novel coronavirus related to severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, (SARS-CoV-2) is the causal agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the genetic mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome being recently investigated, its transcriptomic genetic polymorphisms at inter-host level and the viral gene expression level based on each Open Reading Frame (ORF) remains unclear. Using available High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data and based on SARS-CoV-2 infected human transcriptomic data, this study presents a high-resolution map of SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) hotspots in a viral population at inter-host level. Four throat swab samples from COVID-19 infected patients were pooled, with RNA-Seq read retrieved from SRA NCBI to detect 21 SNPs and a replacement across the SARS-CoV-2 genomic population. Twenty-two RNA modification sites on viral transcripts were identified that may cause inter-host genetic diversity of this virus. In addition, the canonical genomic RNAs of N ORF showed higher expression in transcriptomic data and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR compared to other SARS-CoV-2 ORFs, indicating the importance of this ORF in virus replication or other major functions in virus cycle. Phylogenetic and ancestral sequence analyses based on the entire genome revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is possibly derived from a recombination event between SARS-CoV and Bat SARS-like CoV. Ancestor analysis of the isolates from different locations including Iran suggest shared Chinese ancestry. These results propose the importance of potential inter-host level genetic variations to the evolution of SARS-COV-2, and the formation of viral quasi-species. The RNA modifications discovered in this study may cause amino acid sequence changes in polyprotein, spike protein, product of ORF8 and nucleocapsid (N) protein, suggesting further insights to understanding the functional impacts of mutations in the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2."
9011,The global impact of SARS-CoV-2 in 181 people with cystic fibrosis.,"With the growing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we need to better understand its impact in specific patient groups like those with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). We report on 181 people with CF (32 post-transplant) from 19 countries diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 prior to 13 June 2020. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 appears to exhibit a similar spectrum of outcomes to that seen in the general population, with 11 people admitted to intensive care (7 post-transplant), and 7 deaths (3 post-transplant). A more severe clinical course may be associated with older age, CF-related diabetes, lower lung function in the year prior to infection, and having received an organ transplant. Whilst outcomes in this large cohort are better than initially feared overall, possibly due to a protective effect of the relatively younger age of the CF population compared to other chronic conditions, SARS-CoV-2 is not a benign disease for all people in this patient group."
9012,Establishing the prevalence of common tissue-specific autoantibodies following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.,"Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) has been associated with both transient and persistent systemic symptoms that do not appear to be a direct consequence of viral infection. The generation of autoantibodies has been proposed as a mechanism to explain these symptoms. To understand the prevalence of autoantibodies associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we investigated the frequency and specificity of clinically relevant autoantibodies in 84 individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, suffering from COVID-19 of varying severity in both the acute and convalescent setting. These were compared with results from 32 individuals who were on the intensive therapy unit (ITU) for non-COVID reasons. We demonstrate a higher frequency of autoantibodies in the COVID-19 ITU group compared with non-COVID-19 ITU disease control patients and that autoantibodies were also found in the serum 3-5 months post-COVID-19 infection. Non-COVID patients displayed a diverse pattern of autoantibodies; in contrast, the COVID-19 groups had a more restricted panel of autoantibodies including skin, skeletal muscle and cardiac antibodies. Our results demonstrate that respiratory viral infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the detection of a limited profile of tissue-specific autoantibodies, detectable using routine clinical immunology assays. Further studies are required to determine whether these autoantibodies are specific to SARS-CoV-2 or a phenomenon arising from severe viral infections and to determine the clinical significance of these autoantibodies."
9013,The Impact of COVID-19 in Gastroenterology and Hepatology.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an airborne infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 relies on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor for cellular entry and the abundance of this receptor in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may help explain the GI manifestations, including dysgeusia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, present in over 40% of infected patients. GI tract involvement also raises the concern for oral-fecal transmission which is poorly understood. Outcome studies in COVID-19 patients with preexisting liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease show predominantly mild transaminase elevations and no increased risk from the use of biological agents in inflammatory bowel disease patients. High-dose corticosteroids, however, should be avoided. As endoscopic procedures are aerosol-generating, modifications to clinical practice is necessary to minimize the spread of COVID-19. We have reviewed current literature to describe the impact of COVID-19 in gastroenterology and hepatology as well as targets of future research."

9015,What is the potential function of microRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in COVID-19?,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of COVID-19, a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite of this, no vaccine or approved drug is available to eradicate the virus. In this manuscript, we present an alternative study area that may contribute to development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. We analyzed sixty SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify regions that could work as virus-encoded miRNA seed sponges and potentially bind to human miRNA seed sites and prevent interaction with their native targets thereby relieving native miRNA suppression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionally conserved single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by disrupting translation. MiRNAs are key players in variety of biological processes that regulate differentiation, development and activation of immune cells in both innate and adaptive immunity. We find 34 miRNAs for positive-sense viral RNA and 45 miRNAs for negative-sense that can strongly bind to certain key SARS-CoV-2 genes. The disruption and dysfunction of miRNAs may perturb the immune response and stimulate the release of inflammatory cytokines altering the cellular response to viral infection. Previous studies demonstrate that miRNAs have the potential to be used as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Therefore, its discovery and validation are essential for improving the diagnosis of infection and clinical monitoring in COVID-19."
9016,Factors associated with chemsex in Portugal during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Objective: to investigate the factors associated with the practice of sex under the influence of drugs (chemsex) among Portuguese men who have sex with men during the period of social distancing to prevent the COVID-19. Method: online survey applied in May 2020 to a sample of 1,301 participants living in Portugal, recruited according to Respondent Driven Sampling and via social media FacebookÂ®. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed along with logistic regression to calculate adjusted Odds Ratio (ORa). Results: the prevalence of chemsex was 20.2%. The likelihood of practicing chemsex increased with group sex (ORa: 28.4, 95%CI 16.93-47.49); unprotected sex (ORa: 7.1 95%CI 4.57-10.99); the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent COVID-19 (ORa: 4.2, 95%CI 2.71-6.39) and COVID-19 testing (ORa: 1.9, 95%CI 1.15-3.10). Conclusion: the practice of chemsex among men who have sex with men during the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal was very frequent and may support greater understanding of the role and impact of sexual behavior on the COVID-19 transmission rates and the current pandemic situation in Portugal."
9017,Otologic Manifestations After COVID-19 Vaccination: The House Ear Clinic Experience.,"Objective: With the increasing numbers of COVID-19 vaccinations available there are some reports of new onset of otologic symptoms. We present our experience in recently vaccinated patients over a 30-day time frame. Study design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Tertiary otology ambulatory practice. Patients: All patients with available diagnostic codes, COVID-19 questionnaires and clinical notes. Interventions: Observational recordings. Main outcome measures: Within the same 30-day time period in 2019, 2020, and 2021, 1.6, 2.4, and 3.8% respectively, of all office visits were for patients with the diagnosis of new onset idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) without other underlying otologic diagnoses. In this time frame in 2021, 30 patients out of the 1,325 clinical visits had new or significantly exacerbated otologic symptoms that began shortly after COVID-19 vaccination. Specifically, 18 patients received Moderna and 12 patients received Pfizer vaccine. Their mean age was 60.9Â±13.8 years old; 11 were women and 19 men. The mean onset of symptoms was 10.18 Â± 9 days post-vaccination. Symptoms included 25 patients (83.3%) with hearing loss, 15 (50%) with tinnitus, eight (26.7%) with dizziness, and five (16.7%) with vertigo. Eleven patients had previous otologic diagnoses, including six patients with MeniÃ¨re's disease, two with autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), and three having both. Conclusions: There are no definite correlations to the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccination and new or worsened otologic symptoms. Vaccinated patients with new or exacerbated otologic symptoms should be promptly referred for evaluation. Suspected cases of post-vaccination otologic symptoms should be reported to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS)."
9018,Brief validation of the novel GeneXpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay.,The clinical and epidemiologic management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is critically dependent on molecular assays with short turn-around time. We validated the novel Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay using a commercial nucleic acid testing (Roche Cobas 6800). We found an excellent concordance over a range of SARS-CoV-2 loads and across established human coronaviruses.
9019,[Impact of COVID-19 on elective and emergency colorectal surgery].,Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has led to far-reaching changes in the treatment reality in practically all fields of medicine. Objective: Recommendations on the perioperative management with respect to SARS-CoVâ2 and presentation of the impact of the pandemic on colorectal surgery. Material and methods: A systematic literature search was carried out. Results: Perioperative SARS-CoVâ2 infections lead to a clearly increased postoperative mortality and must be avoided by a structured bundle of measures. The worldwide limitations on screening investigations and treatment options can in the medium term result in an increased mortality due to colorectal cancer. In emergency treatment there was also a substantial reduction in case numbers with the danger of delayed interventions. Conclusion: A rapid normalization of clinical treatment pathways in colorectal surgery is necessary to avoid long-term negative sequelae for patients.
