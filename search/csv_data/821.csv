8200,A Mechanistic Link Between Selenium and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Purpose of review: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease caused by a highly contagious virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and this disease has affected millions of people across the world and led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Nutrition is a key factor related to this disease, and nutritional status may determine the risk and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Selenium is one of the major trace elements required for redox functions and has significant roles in viral infections. The purpose of this review was to examine the current evidence on the role of selenium in COVID-19. We reviewed studies on selenium and COVID-19, and other relevant studies to understand how selenium status can modify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how selenium status might affect a person post-infection. Recent findings: We found that oxidative stress is a characteristic feature of COVID-19 disease, which is linked with the immunopathological disorder observed in individuals with severe COVID-19. Selenium plays a key role in strengthening immunity, reducing oxidative stress, preventing viral infections and supporting critical illness. Moreover, selenium deficiency is related to oxidative stress and hyperinflammation seen in critical illness, and selenium deficiency is found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Selenium supplementation at an appropriate dose may act as supportive therapy in COVID-19. Future studies in large cohorts of COVID-19 are warranted to verify the benefits of selenium supplementation for reducing risk and severity of COVID-19."
8201,An overview of preclinical animal models for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has caused millions of fatalities globally since its origin in November 2019. The SARS-CoV-2 shares 79 and 50 per cent genome similarity with its predecessors, severe SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, all belonging to the same genus, Betacoronavirus. This relatively new virus has stymied the effective control of COVID-19 pandemic and caused huge social and economic impact worldwide. The FDA-approved drugs were re-purposed to reduce the number of fatalities caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, controversy surrounds about the efficacy of these re-purposed antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.This necessitates the identification of new drug targets for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the development of pre-clinical animal model is warranted. Such animal models may help us gain better understanding of the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and will be effective tools for the evaluation and licensure of therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. This review provides a summary of the attempts made till to develop a suitable animal model to understand pathophysiology and effectiveness of therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2."
8202,A Level 1 Trauma Center's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City: a qualitative and quantitative story.,"Background: The purpose of this study is to describe a Level 1 Trauma Center's orthopedic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare outcomes of acute fracture patients pre-COVID versus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: All inpatient fracture cases performed over a 5-month period were identified and retrospective chart review performed. Patients were divided into pre- and COVID-era groups based on when surgery was performed relative to March 16, 2020 (the date elective operations were ceased), and groups were statistically compared. Patients with a COVID test result were further sub-divided into COVID negative and positive groups, and statistically compared. Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-test for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for categorical variables. Results: One hundred and nineteen patients were identified, 38% females with average age of 58 years. Average length of stay was 7 days with average time from injury to surgery of 3 days and average time from admission to surgery of 1.3 days. Overall in-hospital complication rate was 29.4%, and 30-day mortality and readmission rates were 2.5% and 5%, respectively. Sixty-nine patients comprised the pre-COVID group, and 50 in the COVID-era group. There was no significant difference with respect to length of stay, time from injury to surgery, time from admission to surgery, need for post-operative ICU stay, in-hospital complication rate, 30-day mortality rate and 30-day readmission rate. Thirty-four patients had COVID testing, with 24 negative and 10 positive. COVID-positive patients had longer time from injury to surgery (8.5 days vs. 2 days, p = 0.003) and longer time from admission to surgery (2.7 days vs. 1.2 days, p = 0.034). While more COVID-positive patients required ICU admission post-operatively (60% vs. 21%, p = 0.036), there was no difference in overall complication rate. Conclusions: Orthopedic care of acute fracture patients was not affected by a global pandemic. The response of our Level 1 Trauma Center's orthopedic department can guide other hospitals if and when new surges in COVID cases arise, in order to prevent compromising appropriate orthopedic care. Level of evidence: Prognostic III."

8204,"COVID-19 outbreak: history, mechanism, transmission, structural studies and therapeutics.","Purpose: The coronavirus outbreak emerged as a severe pandemic, claiming more than 0.8 million lives across the world and raised a major global health concern. We survey the history and mechanism of coronaviruses, and the structural characteristics of the spike protein and its key residues responsible for human transmissions. Methods: We have carried out a systematic review to summarize the origin, transmission and etiology of COVID-19. The structural analysis of the spike protein and its disordered residues explains the mechanism of the viral transmission. A meta-data analysis of the therapeutic compounds targeting the SARS-CoV-2 is also included. Results: Coronaviruses can cross the species barrier and infect humans with unexpected consequences for public health. The transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher compared to that of the closely related SARS-CoV infections. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, intrinsically disordered regions are observed at the interface of the spike protein and ACE2 receptor, providing a shape complementarity to the complex. The key residues of the spike protein have stronger binding affinity with ACE2. These can be probable reasons for the higher transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we have also discussed the therapeutic compounds and the vaccines to target SARS-CoV-2, which can help researchers to develop effective drugs/vaccines for COVID-19. The overall history and mechanism of entry of SARS-CoV-2 along with structural study of spike-ACE2 complex provide insights to understand disease pathogenesis and development of vaccines and drugs."
8205,On the usefulness of the bioclimatic correlative models of SARS-CoV-2.,"This paper addresses the effects of atmospheric conditions on the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and its associated disease, COVID-19. For this purpose, we assess the limitations of bioclimatic correlative models to explain the geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of medical geography. Overall, there is a broad consensus that the global distribution of COVID-19 is not random but conditioned by environmental drivers. However, as the COVID-19 distribution becomes global, including tropical climates, the evidence reveals that atmospheric conditions explain, at most, only a limited amount of the space-time dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the usefulness of approaches based on bioclimatic envelopes is in question since the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19 seems to be the anthroposphere's non-stationary environment. In this sense, there is a need to clarify further the role of different transmission routes at multiple scales and outdoor and indoor environments beyond bioclimatic envelopes. At this time, the possible influence of the weather in COVID-19 spread is not sufficient to be taken into account in public health policies. Hence, until reliable bioclimatic envelopes of SARS-CoV-2, if any, are found, caution should be exercised when reporting, as this could have unforeseen consequences."
8206,Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Infection from an Urban Ambulatory COVID-19 Clinic-Guidance for Outpatient Clinicians in Triaging Patients.,"Background: Coronavirus infection (COVID) presents with flu-like symptoms and can cause serious complications. Here, we discuss the presentation and outcomes of COVID in an ambulatory setting along with distribution of positive cases amongst healthcare workers (HCWs). Method: Patients who visited the COVID clinic between 03/11/2020 and 06/14/2020 were tested based on the CDC guidelines at the time using PCR-detection methods. Medical records were reviewed and captured on a RedCap database. Statistical analysis was performed using both univariate and bivariate analysis using Fischer's exact test with 2-sided P values. Results: Of the 2471 evaluated patients, 846 (34.2%) tested positive for COVID. Mean age of positivity was 43.4 years (SD Â± 15.4), 60.1% were female and 49% were Black. 58.7% of people tested had a known exposure, and amongst those with exposure, 57.3% tested positive. Ninety-four patients were hospitalized (11.1%), of which 22 patients (23.4%) required ICU admission and 10 patients died. The overall death rate of patients presenting to clinic was 0.4%, or 1.2% amongst positive patients. Median length of hospital stay was 6 days (range 1-51). Symptoms significantly associated with COVID included: anosmia, fever, change in taste, anorexia, myalgias, cough, chills, and fatigue. Increased risk of COVID occurred with diabetes, whereas individuals with lung disease or malignancy were not associated with increased risk of COVID. Amongst COVID positive HCWs, the majority were registered nurses (23.4%), most working in general medicine (39.8%) followed by critical care units (14.3%). Discussion/conclusion: Blacks and females had the highest infection rates. There was a broad range in presentation from those who are very ill and require hospitalization and those who remain ambulatory. The above data could assist health care professionals perform a targeted review of systems and co-morbidities, allowing for appropriate patient triage."
8207,#Coronavirus: Monitoring the Belgian Twitter Discourse on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pandemic.,"In this study, a social media analysis is conducted to examine the public discourse about the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on Twitter. In particular, this study aims to examine (a) how the number of tweets varies as a function of the timeline of the pandemic and associated measures and (b) how the content of these tweets, including displayed emotions, changes. Therefore, 373,908 tweets and retweets from Belgium were collected from February 25, 2020 to the March 30. Time series analysis, network bigrams, topic models, and emotional lexica were deployed for analysis. The results showed that significant events related to the virus correlated with an immediate increase in the number of tweets addressing them. Furthermore, the Belgian Twitter discourse was characterized by positively connoted words, which also refer to European solidarity. These findings do not only stress the relevance of Twitter as a medium for public discourse during lockdowns, but also seem to indicate that the Belgian public supports policy measures that respect solidarity in Europe."
8208,[A boy with a rare pulmonary disease; COVID-19 is clouding our judgment].,"Background: In times of coronavirus, a patient with respiratory symptoms whose chest CT scan reveals ground-glass opacities, COVID-19 may seem an obvious diagnosis. Case description: At the (currently assumed) peak of the coronavirus crisis, a 12-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital twice for severe respiratory symptoms. A chest CT scan revealed ground-glass opacities.COVID-19 pneumonia was initially thought of. However, it turned out to be a rare interstitial pulmonary disease. Conclusion: Due to the increased awareness about COVID-19, tunnel vision is lurking. Even during a health crisis, doctors should remain alert to alternative diagnoses."
8209,Functional and Structural Characterization of SARS-Cov-2 Spike Protein: An In Silico Study.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), which has been considered as a pandemic by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 encodes four major structural proteins, among which spike protein has always been a main target for new vaccine studies. This in silico study aimed to investigate some physicochemical, functional, immunological, and structural features of spike protein using several bioinformatics tools. Method: We retrieved all SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences from different countries registered in NCBI GenBank. CLC Sequence Viewer was employed to translate and align the sequences, and several programs were utilized to predict B-cell epitopes. Modification sites such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and disulfide bonds were defined. Secondary and tertiary structures of all sequences were further computed. Results: Some mutations were determined, where only one (D614G) had a high prevalence. The mutations did not impact the B-cell and physicochemical properties of the spike protein. Seven disulfide bonds were specified and also predicted in several N-link glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The results also indicated that spike protein is a non-allergen. Conclusion: In summary, our findings provided a deep understanding of spike protein, which can be valuable for future studies on SARS-CoV-2 infections and design of new vaccines."
