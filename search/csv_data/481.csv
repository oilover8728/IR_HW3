4800,COVID-19 and human reproduction: A pandemic that packs a serious punch.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a worldwide health emergency that has impacted 188 countries at last count. The rapid community transmission and relatively high mortality rates with COVID-19 in modern times are relatively unique features of this flu pandemic and have resulted in an unparalleled global health crisis. SARS-CoV-2, being a respiratory virus, mainly affects the lungs, but is capable of infecting other vital organs, such as brain, heart and kidney. Emerging evidence suggests that the virus also targets male and female reproductive organs that express its main receptor ACE2, although it is as yet unclear if this has any implications for human fertility. Furthermore, professional bodies have recommended discontinuing fertility services during the pandemic such that reproductive services have also been affected. Although increased safety measures have helped to mitigate the propagation of COVID-19 in a number of countries, it seems that there is no predictable timeline to containment of the virus, a goal likely to remain elusive until an effective vaccine becomes available and widely distributed across the globe. In parallel, research on reproduction has been postponed for obvious reasons, while diagnostic tests that detect the virus or antibodies against it are of vital importance to support public health policies, such as social distancing and our obligation to wear masks in public spaces. This review aims to provide an overview of critical research and ethics issues that have been continuously emerging in the field of reproductive medicine as the COVID-19 pandemic tragically unfolds.Abbreviations: ACE2: angiotensin- converting enzyme 2; ART: Assisted reproductive technology; ASRM: American Society for Reproductive Medicine; CCR9: C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 9; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; Ct: Cycle threshold; CXCR6: C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 6; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ESHRE: European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology; ET: Embryo transfer; FSH: Follicle Stimulating Hormone; FFPE: formalin fixed paraffin embedded; FYCO1: FYVE And Coiled-Coil Domain Autophagy Adaptor 1; IFFS: International Federation of Fertility Societies; IUI: Intrauterine insemination; IVF: In vitro fertilization; LH: Luteinizing Hormone; LZTFL1: Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor Like 1; MAR: medically assisted reproduction services; MERS: Middle East Respiratory syndrome; NGS: Next Generation Sequencing; ORF: Open Reading Frame; PPE: personal protective equipment; RE: RNA Element; REDa: RNA Element Discovery algorithm; RT-PCR: Reverse=trascriptase transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; SLC6A20: Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 20; SMS: Single Molecule Sequencing; T: Testosterone; TMPRSS2: transmembrane serine protease 2; WHO: World Health Organization; XCR1: X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor."
4801,Case of Guillain-Barre syndrome following COVID-19 vaccine.,"Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) is a rare immune-mediated disorder of the peripheral nerves. Although its cause is not fully understood, the syndrome often follows infection with a virus or bacteria, although in rare occasions, vaccination may precede GBS. We describe a case of a 62-year-old woman who presented with paraesthesia and progressive weakness of both lower limbs over 3 days. Clinical examination and investigation findings including lumbar puncture and nerve conduction studies were consistent with the diagnosis of GBS. She had no history of either diarrhoea or respiratory tract infections preceding her presentation. However, she had her first intramuscular dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine 11 days prior to her presentation. Although no direct link could be ascertained, the purpose of this report is to highlight the incidence and consider this issue while evaluating any case of GBS in the light of the current pandemic and vaccination programme."
4802,Willingness to Take COVID-19 Vaccines in Ethiopia: An Instrumental Variable Probit Approach.,"This paper analyzed the factors influencing the willingness of Ethiopia's population to take COVID-19 vaccines. The data included the COVID-19 High Frequency Phone Survey of Households in Ethiopia that were collected in 2021. This paper relied on the 10th round of the survey, which was comprised of 2178 households. The Instrumental Variable Probit regression model was used to analyze the data. The results showed that majority of the respondents (92.33%) would receiveCOVID-19 vaccines, while 6.61% and 1.06% were, respectively, unwilling and unsure. Across the regions of Ethiopia, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNPR) (99.30%), Oromia (97.54%), Tigray (97.04%) and Gambela (95.42%) had the highest proportions of respondents willing to have the vaccine. Vaccine safety concern was the topmost reason for those unwilling to receive the vaccine. The results of the Instrumental Variable Probit regression showed that currently working, age, engagement with non-farm businesses and region of residence significantly influenced the population's willingness to take the vaccine (p < 0.05). It was concluded that although the willingness be vaccinated was impressive, without everyone being receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, infection risk can still be high; this is due to the persistent mutation of the viral strains. Thus, there is a need to intensify efforts toward addressing the safety issues of COVID-19 vaccines, while efforts to enhance acceptability should focus on the youth population and those who are unemployed."

4804,"Domiciliary Hospitalization through Wearable Biomonitoring Patches: Recent Advances, Technical Challenges, and the Relation to Covid-19.","This article reviews recent advances and existing challenges for the application of wearable bioelectronics for patient monitoring and domiciliary hospitalization. More specifically, we focus on technical challenges and solutions for the implementation of wearable and conformal bioelectronics for long-term patient biomonitoring and discuss their application on the Internet of medical things (IoMT). We first discuss the general architecture of IoMT systems for domiciliary hospitalization and the three layers of the system, including the sensing, communication, and application layers. In regard to the sensing layer, we focus on current trends, recent advances, and challenges in the implementation of stretchable patches. This includes fabrication strategies and solutions for energy storage and energy harvesting, such as printed batteries and supercapacitors. As a case study, we discuss the application of IoMT for domiciliary hospitalization of COVID 19 patients. This can be used as a strategy to reduce the pressure on the healthcare system, as it allows continuous patient monitoring and reduced physical presence in the hospital, and at the same time enables the collection of large data for posterior analysis. Finally, based on the previous works in the field, we recommend a conceptual IoMT design for wearable monitoring of COVID 19 patients."
4805,Sensitive detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 by multiplex droplet digital RT-PCR.,"The purpose of this study is to develop a one-step droplet digital RT-PCR (RT-ddPCR) multiplex assay that allows for sensitive quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with respect to human-derived RNA and could be used for screening and monitoring of Covid-19 patients. A one-step RT-ddPCR multiplex assay was developed for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 E, RdRp and N viral RNA, and human Rpp30 DNA and GUSB mRNA, for internal nucleic acid (NA) extraction and RT-PCR control. Dilution series of viral RNA transcripts were prepared in water and total NA extract of Covid-19-negative patients. As reference assay, an E-GUSB duplex RT-PCR was used. GUSB mRNA detection was used to set validity criteria to assure viral RNA and RT-PCR assay quality and to enable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In a background of at least 100 GUSB mRNA copies, 5 copies of viral RNA are reliably detectable and 10 copies viral RNA copies are reliably quantifiable. It was found that assay sensitivity of the RT-ddPCR was not affected by the total NA background while assay sensitivity of the gold standard RT-PCR assay is drastically decreased when SARS-CoV-2 copies were detected in a background of total NA extract compared with water. The present study describes a robust and sensitive one-step ddRT-PCR multiplex assay for reliable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. By determining the fractional abundance of viral RNA with respect to a human housekeeping gene, viral loads from different samples can be compared, what could be used to investigate the infectiveness and to monitor Covid-19 patients."
4806,"Evolutionary study of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as an emerging coronavirus: Phylogenetic analysis and literature review.","Since emerging coronaviruses have always become a human health concern globally especially severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and a novel coronavirus was introduced in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (called SARS-CoV-2), many researchers focused on its epidemics, virological and clinical features. SARS-CoV-2 is classified as Betacoronaviruses genus and Sarbecovirus subgenus (lineage B). The virus shows a great similarity with SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. In this study, we evaluate SARS-CoV-2 virus phylogeny and evolution by using current virus and related sequences."
4807,Frequency of nasopharyngeal swab collection and positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of the Italian province of Udine with and without chronic conditions.,"Severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with comorbidities. However, no information is available on the frequency of nasopharyngeal swab collection and positivity depending on comorbidities. Using a cross-sectional design, we assessed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 tests and of positivity in the general population of the 530,000-inhabitant Italian province of Udine and in subgroups affected by chronic conditions in the first weeks of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Anonymous health databases were used as source of information to identify persons with 14 chronic conditions. From laboratory records we assessed the likelihood of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and the frequency of positivity from February 29 to April 19, 2020, i.e., 7 weeks from the first case detected in the study area. Sex and age-stratified proportions were calculated in comorbidity subgroups. Multivariate regression was used to adjust for confounders. In the province, 236,623 persons had ‚â•1 chronic condition; 869 had positive tests. Persons with comorbidities were tested more than the others. However, most chronic conditions were not significantly associated with the prevalence of positivity, except psychiatric and neurological diseases and diabetes. In conclusion, despite more frequent testing, patients with most chronic diseases where equally likely to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 as the general population. Chronic patients should adhere to general recommendations for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, but ad hoc restrictions do not seem necessary."

4809,Misrepresentation about vaccines that are scaring women.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has contributed greatly to morbidity and mortality worldwide. The production of COVID-19 vaccines has been tested for efficacy and safety via clinical trials. However, false information on the side effects of the vaccine has been spread via social media, creating fear of vaccination. Currently, the vaccine has been falsely reported to cause infertility in women of reproductive age and miscarriages in pregnant women. There is no evidence to support this information as the COVID-19 vaccines have been clinically approved for safety. Furthermore, pregnant and lactating women were not included in the clinical trials. Therefore, the objective of this report is to raise awareness that the rumours on the vaccine are false and to encourage every individual to accept the vaccination for their safety and the safety of their loved ones."
