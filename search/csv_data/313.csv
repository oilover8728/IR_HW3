3120,An Insight on the Arrangement of a Remote Military COVID-19 Vaccination Site.,
3121,The COVID-19-Cancer Connection.,"I recently completed work at a large-scale, drive-through COVID-19 vaccination initiative and was immediately struck by its military parallel in mobilizing this emergent medical response. Federal personnel were deployed quickly to assist the local workforce untested in a public health domain. The expansive integration of technology was at a level I had not previously witnessed. Computerized algorithms organized the flow of cars through a huge fairground (think Disneyland Park). Databases were created to register the public, make appointments, and document the specifics of vaccination administration. From day one, the pharmacy tent was in constant overdrive to ensure vaccine supply was in sync with hourly demand. The interface of all these platforms vaccinated 2,300 people per day."

3123,Wisely choosing the numbers during the pandemic.,"Having the right data is critical in managing a crisis. More so, at the time of a pandemic. Rather than relying heavily on absolute numbers, we discuss alternatives that could improve testing numbers in India."
3124,Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID-19 vaccines worsening clinical disease.,"Aims of the study: Patient comprehension is a critical part of meeting medical ethics standards of informed consent in study designs. The aim of the study was to determine if sufficient literature exists to require clinicians to disclose the specific risk that COVID-19 vaccines could worsen disease upon exposure to challenge or circulating virus. Methods used to conduct the study: Published literature was reviewed to identify preclinical and clinical evidence that COVID-19 vaccines could worsen disease upon exposure to challenge or circulating virus. Clinical trial protocols for COVID-19 vaccines were reviewed to determine if risks were properly disclosed. Results of the study: COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials. Conclusions drawn from the study and clinical implications: The specific and significant COVID-19 risk of ADE should have been and should be prominently and independently disclosed to research subjects currently in vaccine trials, as well as those being recruited for the trials and future patients after vaccine approval, in order to meet the medical ethics standard of patient comprehension for informed consent."
3125,Hydrogel particles improve detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from multiple sample types.,"Here we present a rapid and versatile method for capturing and concentrating SARS-CoV-2 from contrived transport medium and saliva samples using affinity-capture magnetic hydrogel particles. We demonstrate that the method concentrates virus from 1 mL samples prior to RNA extraction, substantially improving detection of virus using real-time RT-PCR across a range of viral titers (100-1,000,000 viral copies/mL) and enabling detection of virus using the 2019 nCoV CDC EUA Kit down to 100 viral copies/mL. This method is compatible with commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits (i.e., from Qiagen) and a simple heat and detergent method that extracts viral RNA directly off the particle, allowing a sample processing time of 10 min. We furthermore tested our method in transport medium diagnostic remnant samples that previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, showing that our method not only correctly identified all positive samples but also substantially improved detection of the virus in low viral load samples. The average improvement in cycle threshold value across all viral titers tested was 3.1. Finally, we illustrate that our method could potentially be used to enable pooled testing, as we observed considerable improvement in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from sample volumes of up to 10 mL."
3126,Why should HCWs receive priority access to vaccines in a pandemic?,"Background: Viral pandemics present a range of ethical challenges for policy makers, not the least among which are difficult decisions about how to allocate scarce healthcare resources. One important question is whether healthcare workers (HCWs) should receive priority access to a vaccine in the event that an effective vaccine becomes available. This question is especially relevant in the coronavirus pandemic with governments and health authorities currently facing questions of distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Main text: In this article, we critically evaluate the most common ethical arguments for granting healthcare workers priority access to a vaccine. We review the existing literature on this topic, and analyse both deontological and utilitarian arguments in favour of HCW prioritisation. For illustrative purposes, we focus in particular on the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine. We also explore some practical complexities attendant on arguments in favour of HCW prioritisation. Conclusions: We argue that there are deontological and utilitarian cases for prioritising HCWs. Indeed, the widely held view that we should prioritise HCWs represents an example of ethical convergence. Complexities arise, however, when considering who should be included in the category of HCW, and who else should receive priority in addition to HCWs."

3128,Universities as Catalysts for COVID-19 Vaccination: A Call to Action.,"Universities have the ability to be a strong community collaborator in mitigating the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and ensuring that vaccination becomes a community norm. With their in-house expertise, ability to increase the reach of a message, and potential for vaccinating a large number of people, universities can be at the forefront of leading our country back to prepandemic times. This article discusses how universities can collaborate with communities to ensure mass vaccination, as well as give strategies to increase immunization rates on campus and beyond."
3129,COVID-19 presenting with nystagmus.,"This case reports a 20-year-old female patient who was in northern Italy when the state of emergency was declared on the 31st of January 2020, developing 15days after return to Spain upper respiratory symptoms characterized by fever, headache and anosmia that was treated as sinusitis. Three weeks later presented with dizziness and an intermittent horizontal nystagmus with rotatory component. Otorhinolaryngology and neurological examination including MRI were normal. COVID-19 IgG antibodies where positive. In the context of the ongoing pandemic, and associating the symptoms with positive IgG antibodies, we can consider the infection of SARS-CoV-2 as a probable cause of the acquired nystagmus."
