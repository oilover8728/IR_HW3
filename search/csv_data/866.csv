8650,The probable destructive mechanisms behind COVID-19 on male reproduction system and fertility.,"Purpose: The present study aims to summarize the current understanding of probable mechanisms and claims of adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male fertility potential. Methods: Our search was including original articles, reviews, guidelines, letters to the editor, comments on guidelines, and editorials, regarding the male reproductive system. We used the words SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, ""2019 ncov,"" testis, sperm, male factor infertility, fertility treatment, semen, assisted reproductive technology (ART), sexual transmission, and ACE2. Results: Data showed coronavirus affects men more than women because of more expression of 2019 nCoV receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in testicular cells. Also, ""Bioinformatics Analysis"" suggests that sperm production may be damaged, since ""Pseudo Time Analysis"" has shown disruption in spermatogenesis. ""Gene Ontology"" (GO) showed an increase in viral reproduction and a decrease in sperm production-related terms. Recently, SARS-COV-2 mRNA and protein were detected in the semen of patients that had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the probable disruption of blood-testis barrier (BTB) in febrile diseases is suspected in the acute phase of the disease enabling viral entry into the testes. Not only is spermatogenesis disturbed, but also disturbs gonadotropin, androgens, and testosterone secretion during SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sexual transmission has been reported yet; however, detection of the virus in semen still makes the sexual transmission an open question. Conclusion: There is a concern that male fertility may be disturbed after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, follow-up of the reproductive functions and male fertility may be necessary in recovered cases, especially in aged men."
8651,Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with the Blood-Brain Barrier.,"Emerging data indicate that neurological complications occur as a consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical interface that regulates entry of circulating molecules into the CNS, and is regulated by signals that arise from the brain and blood compartments. In this review, we discuss mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interactions with the BBB may contribute to neurological dysfunction associated with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2. We consider aspects of peripheral disease, such as hypoxia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome/cytokine storm, as well as CNS infection and mechanisms of viral entry into the brain. We also discuss the contribution of risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 to BBB dysfunction that could increase viral entry or otherwise damage the brain."
8652,Global variation in SARS-CoV-2 proteome and its implication in pre-lockdown emergence and dissemination of 5 dominant SARS-CoV-2 clades.,"SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing major havoc worldwide with its efficient transmission and propagation. To track the emergence as well as the persistence of mutations during the early stage of the pandemic, a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 whole proteome sequences has been performed by considering manually curated 31,389 whole genome sequences from 84 countries. Among the 7 highly recurring (percentage frequency≥10%) mutations (Nsp2:T85I, Nsp6:L37F, Nsp12:P323L, Spike:D614G, ORF3a:Q57H, N protein:R203K and N protein:G204R), N protein:R203K and N protein: G204R are co-occurring (dependent) mutations. Nsp12:P323L and Spike:D614G often appear simultaneously. The highly recurring Spike:D614G, Nsp12:P323L and Nsp6:L37F as well as moderately recurring (percentage frequency between ≥1 and <10%) ORF3a:G251V and ORF8:L84S mutations have led to4 major clades in addition to a clade that lacks high recurring mutations. Further, the occurrence of ORF3a:Q57H&Nsp2:T85I, ORF3a:Q57H and N protein:R203K&G204R along with Nsp12:P323L&Spike:D614G has led to 3 additional sub-clades. Similarly, occurrence of Nsp6:L37F and ORF3a:G251V together has led to the emergence of a sub-clade. Nonetheless, ORF8:L84S does not occur along with ORF3a:G251V or Nsp6:L37F. Intriguingly, ORF3a:G251V and ORF8:L84S are found to occur independent of Nsp12:P323L and Spike:D614G mutations. These clades have evolved during the early stage of the pandemic and have disseminated across several countries. Further, Nsp10 is found to be highly resistant to mutations, thus, it can be exploited for drug/vaccine development and the corresponding gene sequence can be used for the diagnosis. Concisely, the study reports the SARS-CoV-2 antigens diversity across the globe during the early stage of the pandemic and facilitates the understanding of viral evolution."
8653,Recreational waters - A potential transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 to humans?,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has lead to high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, has been causing major public health concerns since first detected in late 2019. Following identification of novel pathogens, questions in relation to dissemination of the pathogen and transmission routes begin to emerge. This rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in both faecal and wastewater samples across the globe, highlighting the potential for faecal-oral transmission of the virus. As a result, concerns regarding the transmission of the virus in the environment and the risk associated with contracting the virus in recreational waters, particularly where inadequately treated wastewater is discharged, have been emerging in recent weeks. This paper highlights the need for further research to be carried out to investigate the presence, infectivity and viability of this newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater effluent and receiving recreational waters."
8654,Bidirectional association between COVID-19 and the environment: A systematic review.,"The global crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) affected economics, social affairs, and the environment, not to mention public health. It is estimated that near 82% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome. The purpose of the review is to highlight how the virus is impacted by the environment and how the virus has impacted the environment. This review was based on an electronic search of the literature in the Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed database published from December 2019 to July 2020 using combinations of the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2 transmission, COVID-19 transmission, coronavirus transmission, waterborne, wastewater, airborne, solid waste, fomites, and fecal-oral transmission. Studies suggest the thermal properties of ambient air, as well as relative humidity, may affect the transmissibility and viability of the virus. Samples taken from the wastewater collection network were detected contaminated with the novel coronavirus; consequently, there is a concern of its transmission via an urban sewer system. There are concerns about the efficacy of the wastewater treatment plant disinfection process as the last chance to inactivate the virus. Handling solid waste also requires an utmost caution as it may contain infectious masks, etc. Following the PRISMA approach, among all reviewed studies, more than 36% of them were directly or indirectly related to the indoor and outdoor environment, 16% to meteorological factors, 11% to wastewater, 14% to fomites, 8% to water, 9% to solid waste, and 6% to the secondary environment. The still growing body of literature on COVID-19 and air, suggests the importance of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via air and indoor air quality, especially during lockdown interventions. Environmental conditions are found to be a factor in transmitting the virus beyond geographical borders. Accordingly, countries need to pay extra attention to sustainable development themes and goals."
8655,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): The epidemic and the challenges.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond."
8656,Fatal Takotsubo syndrome in critical COVID-19 related pneumonia.,"COVID-19 can involve several organs and systems, often with indirect and poorly clarified mechanisms. Different presentations of myocardial injury have been reported, with variable degrees of severity, often impacting on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying cardiac damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection are under active investigation. We report the clinical and autopsy findings of a fatal case of Takotsubo Syndrome occurring in an 83-year-old patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient was admitted to Emergency Department with dyspnea, fever and diarrhea. A naso-pharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. In the following week his conditions worsened, requiring intubation and deep sedation. While in the ICU, the patient suddenly showed ST segment elevation. Left ventricular angiography showed decreased with hypercontractile ventricular bases and mid-apical ballooning, consistent with diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome. Shortly after the patient was pulseless. After extensive resuscitation maneuvers, the patient was declared dead. Autopsy revealed a subepicardial hematoma, in absence of myocardial rupture. On histology, the myocardium showed diffuse edema, multiple foci of contraction band necrosis in both ventricles and occasional coagulative necrosis of single cardiac myocytes. Abundant macrophages CD68+ were detected in the myocardial interstitium. The finding of diffuse contraction band necrosis supports the pathogenic role of increased catecholamine levels; the presence of a significant interstitial inflammatory infiltrate, made up by macrophages, remains of uncertain significance."
8657,S-Variant SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B1.1.7 Is Associated With Significantly Higher Viral Load in Samples Tested by TaqPath Polymerase Chain Reaction.,"A SARS-CoV-2 variant B1.1.7 containing mutation Δ69/70 has spread rapidly in the United Kingdom and shows an identifiable profile in ThermoFisher TaqPath RT-qPCR, S gene target failure (SGTF). We analyzed recent test data for trends and significance. Linked cycle threshold (Ct) values for respiratory samples showed that a low Ct for ORF1ab and N were clearly associated with SGTF. Significantly more SGTF samples had higher inferred viral loads between 1×107 and 1×108. Our conclusion is that patients whose samples exhibit the SGTF profile are more likely to have high viral loads, which may explain higher infectivity and rapidity of spread."
8658,"Comment on ""The neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients"".","We have read with great care and interest the article by Li et al The authors provide interesting elements with respect to the possible entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at the brain area and plead for an implication of the central nervous system in respiratory problems linked to coronavirus disease. Here we provide additional elements that support those observations, notably the role of brainstem structures located in the medulla oblongata in modulating respiration. We also discussed the possible pathways the virus uses to cross the brain blood barrier and reach the brainstem."
8659,Developing a Paper-Based Antigen Assay to Differentiate between Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Variants.,"COVID-19 first appeared in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, it has become a global pandemic. A robust and scalable diagnostics strategy is crucial for containing and monitoring the pandemic. RT-PCR is a known, reliable method for COVID-19 diagnostics, which can differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. However, PCR is location-dependent, time-consuming, and relatively expensive. Thus, there is a need for a more flexible method, which may be produced in an off-the-shelf format and distributed more widely. Paper-based immunoassays can fulfill this function. Here, we present the first steps toward a paper-based test, which can differentiate between different spike proteins of various coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and CoV-HKU1, with negligible cross-reactivity for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E in a single assay, which takes less than 30 min. Furthermore, our test can distinguish between fractions of the same spike protein. This is done by an altered assay design with four test line locations where each antigen builds a unique, identifiable binding pattern. The effect of several factors, such as running media, immunoprobe concentration, and antigen interference, is considered. We find that running media has a significant effect on the final binding pattern where human saliva provides results while human serum leads to the lowest signal quality."
