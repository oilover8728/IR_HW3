6760,Prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection using a seroepidemiological survey.,"The prevalence of asymptomatic infection by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a critical measure for effectiveness of mitigation strategy has been reported to be widely varied. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic infection using serosurvey on general population. In a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey in Guilan province, Iran, the specific antibody against COVID-19 in a representative sample was detected using rapid test kits. Among 117 seropositive subjects, prevalence of asymptomatic infection was determined based on the history of symptoms during the preceding 3 months. The design-adjusted prevalence of asymptomatic infection was 57.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 44-69). The prevalence was significantly lower in subjects with previous contacts to COVID-19 patients (12%, 95% CI 2-49) than others without (69%, 95% CI, 46-86). The lowest prevalence was for painful body symptom (74.4%). This study revealed that more than half of the infected COVID-19 patients had no symptoms. The implications of our findings include the importance of adopting public health measures such as social distancing and inefficiency of contact tracing to interrupt epidemic transmission."
6761,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among Internal Medicine Residents at a Major Academic Medicine Residency Program.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease (COVID-19) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality across the United States. Internal medicine (IM) residents are a critical component of the healthcare workforce yet their seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is largely unknown. The aim of this research was to ascertain the seroprevalences of SARS-CoV-2 among internal medicine residents during the first peak of COVID-19. Methods: IM residents were enrolled in a surveillance program that included PCR and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 in June 2020. Residents also completed a short questionnaire to obtain sociodemographic information and characterize potential workplace exposure to COVID-19. Results: A total of 101 IM residents participated in the study (out of N=162). Of the 101 samples, three (2.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. No residents tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Discussion: The implementation of COVID-19 patient cohorting and the incorporation of telemedicine to communicate with hospitalized patients into clinical practice early in the pandemic may have prevented the spread of the virus among the surveyed clinical trainees. Conclusion: Despite significant engagement with COVID-19 patients, IM residents demonstrated a low rate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence."
6762,Patient follow-up after discharge after COVID-19 pneumonia: Considerations for infectious control.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a significant global medical issue, with a growing number of cumulative confirmed cases. However, a large number of patients with COVID-19 have overcome the disease, meeting hospital discharge criteria, and are gradually returning to work and social life. Nonetheless, COVID-19 may cause further downstream issues in these patients, such as due to possible reactivation of the virus, long-term pulmonary defects, and posttraumatic stress disorder. In this study, we, therefore, queried relevant literature concerning severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19 for reference to come to a consensus on follow-up strategies. We found that strategies, such as the implementation of polymerase chain reaction testing, imaging surveillance, and psychological assessments, starting at the time of discharge, were necessary for long-term follow-up. If close care is given to every aspect of coronavirus management, we expect that the pandemic outbreak will soon be overcome."
6763,The Demographic Analysis of the Probable COVID-19 Cases in Terms of RT-PCR Results and Age.,"Background: Despite global prevention and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 disease continues to increase. As a possible cause, our aim was to investigate which parameters increase the sensitivity or protection against COVID-19 between RT-PCR positive and RT-PCR negative cases in patients admitted to the emergency department. Methods: In the pandemic process, patients admitted to the hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 were evaluated retrospectively. RT-PCR test was divided into + (for Group 1) and - (Group 2). The gender, age, clinical information, application symptoms, and comorbidity data of the patients were evaluated. Results: One hundred and sixty-seven cases were evaluated in the study. Group 1: 88 cases, M/F ratio: 46/42 and average age 48 ± 17.3 years, Group 2: 79 cases, M/F ratio was approximately 3/2, and the average age was 48.3 ± 19.4 years. When the groups were compared in terms of symptoms, fever, cough, weakness, and headache were prominent in Group 1, whereas the contact was significantly higher in Group 2 (p < 0.05). Among the comorbid diseases, only COPD showed a significant difference between the groups, and it was found significantly higher in Group 2 (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Cough, headache, and fever were found valuable in the detection of cases. Attention should be paid to contact isolation to circumvent the pandemic process with less damage. Having chronic diseases, especially COPD, increases the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Close monitoring and control of chronic diseases can positively change the course of COVID-19."

6765,Evaluation of an antigen-based test for hospital point-of-care diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Background: An accurate diagnosis is essential to identify and manage SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and implement infection control measures. Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current recommended laboratory method, several rapid antigen point-of-care tests (POCTs) were developed as frontline testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess a recently CE-approved POCT, SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test on the LumiraDx™ Platform (LumiraDx GmbH, Cologne, Germany) for the identification of SARS-COV-2 infected subjects at hospital setting. Methods: LumiraDx POCT was implemented in three hospital settings: adult and pediatric emergency departments and occupational medicine department along two-month period during the second peak of Italian SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Rapid antigen testing was performed on direct nasal swabs and results were compared with those obtained by Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. Results: Overall sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were 90.3%, 92.1%, 95.1%, and 84.9%, respectively, compared to reference method. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for symptomatic group were 89.3% [95% IC 84.2-93.3], 88.2% [95% IC 72.5-96.7], 97.8% [95% IC 94.6-99.1], and 58.8% [95% IC 48.4-68.5], respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for asymptomatic group were 92.1% [95% IC 85-96.5], 92.3% [95% IC 89.9-94.4], 67.9% [95% IC 61.3-73.8], and 98.5% [95% IC 97.1-99.2], respectively. False positive and negative antigen testing results in both symptomatic and asymptomatic group were observed. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 Ag POCT may represent an interesting tool to rapidly identify symptomatic or asymptomatic infected subjects. However, in hospital setting in which false negative or false positive results may have relevant implications, confirmatory NAAT always remains necessary for the appropriate management of patients."
6766,Bilateral paracentral acute middle maculopathy and acute macular neuroretinopathy following COVID-19 vaccination.,"A 35-year-old male patient presented with blurring and black spots in vision after 1 month of the second dose of Covishield vaccination. His visual acuity was 6/6; both eyes and anterior and posterior segment examinations were normal. The optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed multiple hyperreflective lesions involving the nerve fiber layer with back shadowing. In addition, there were hyperreflective spots in the ganglion cell layer and outer plexiform layer with focal loss of external limiting membrane and an intact inner segment/outer segment junction involving the posterior pole in both eyes. The patient was diagnosed with paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) and acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) and advised observation. PAMM and AMN are unreported manifestations following the COVID-19 vaccination."
6767,"SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Seroprevalence in Wuhan, China, from 23 April to 24 May 2020.","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. To investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we conducted serologic tests on 35,326 individuals from four different communities to estimate cumulative incidence of infection. Our results showed that 1,332 individuals (3.77%) showed positive COVID-19 antibody (either IgM or IgG). Males had a lower positivity rate than females (3.02% versus 4.52%). The antibody positivity rates showed a clear trend of increase according to patients' ages and varied among different communities. The results indicate that public health interventions may play important roles in the control of COVID-19.IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Afterwards, a number of public health interventions were implemented, including lock-down, face mask ordinances, and social distancing. Studies that rely on viral RNA testing of symptomatic patients have shown that these multifaceted interventions contributed to the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and delayed the epidemic's progression. However, these estimates of confirmed cases may miss large numbers of asymptomatic patients and recovered symptomatic patients who were not tested. To investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we conducted serologic tests on 35,326 individuals to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection. The results suggest that public health interventions may play important roles in the control of COVID-19."
6768,Update on geographical variation and distribution of SARS-nCoV-2: A systematic review.,"Knowledge of a new mutant strain of SARS-coronavirus (CoV-2) is enormously essential to identify a targeted drug and for the development of the vaccine. In this article, we systematically reviewed the different mutation strains (variant of concern [VOC] and variant of interest [VOI]) which were found in different countries such as the UK, Singapore, China, Germany, Vietnam, Western Africa, Dublin, Ireland, Brazil, Iran, Italy, France, America, and Philippines. We searched four literature databases (PubMed, EMBASE, NATURE, and Willey online library) with suitable keywords and the time filter was November 2019 to June 16, 2021. To understand the worldwide spread of variants of SARS-CoV-2, we included a total of 27 articles of case reports, clinical and observational studies in the systematic review. However, these variants mostly spread because of their ability to increase transmission, virulence, and escape immunity. So, in this paper is we found mutated strains of SARS-CoV-2 like VOCs that are found in different regions across the globe are ALPHA strain in the U.K, BETA strain in South Africa, GAMMA strain in Brazil, Gamma and Beta strains in European Countries, and some VOIs like Theta variant in the Philippines."
6769,Analysis of Chest CT Results of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients at First Follow-Up.,"Objective: To investigate the dissipation and outcomes of pulmonary lesions at the first follow-up of patients who recovered from moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. Methods: From January 21 to March 3, 2020, a total of 136 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 52 patients who recovered from COVID-19 were included in this study, including 33 moderate cases and 19 severe cases. Three senior radiologists independently and retrospectively analyzed the chest CT imaging data of 52 patients at the last time of admission and the first follow-up after discharge, including primary manifestations, concomitant manifestations, and degree of residual lesion dissipation. Results: At the first follow-up after discharge, 16 patients with COVID-19 recovered to normal chest CT appearance, while 36 patients still had residual pulmonary lesions, mainly including 33 cases of ground-glass opacity, 5 cases of consolidation, and 19 cases of fibrous strip shadow. The proportion of residual pulmonary lesions in severe cases (17/19) was statistically higher than in moderate cases (19/33) (χ 2 = 5.759, P < 0.05). At the first follow-up, residual pulmonary lesions were dissipated to varying degrees in 47 cases, and lesions remained unchanged in 5 cases. There were no cases of increased numbers of lesions, enlargement of lesions, or appearance of new lesions. The dissipation of residual pulmonary lesions in moderate patients was statistically better than in severe patients (Z = -2.538, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Clinically cured patients with COVID-19 had faster dissipation of residual pulmonary lesions after discharge, while moderate patients had better dissipation than severe patients. However, at the first follow-up, most patients still had residual pulmonary lesions, which were primarily ground-glass opacity and fibrous strip shadow. The proportion of residual pulmonary lesions was higher in severe cases of COVID-19, which required further follow-up."
