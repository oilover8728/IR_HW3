1860,Clinical characteristics and antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 protein using VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in COVID-19 patients in Japan.,"Introduction. Serological tests for COVID-19 are important in providing results for surveillance and supporting diagnosis. Investigating the serological response in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity is important for assessing the clinical utility of serological assays.Gap Statement. However, few studies have investigated the clinical utility of antibody assays for COVID-19 or differences in antibody response in association with disease severity.Aim. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and clinical utility of VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests according to COVID-19 severity in patients in Japan.Methodology. We analysed 255 serum specimens from 130 COVID-19 patients and examined clinical records and laboratory data. Presence of total (IgA, IgM, and IgG) and specific IgG antibody for the spike 1 antigen of SARS-CoV-2 was determined using VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests.Results. Overall, 98 (75.4 %) and 32 (24.6 %) patients had mild and severe COVID-19, respectively. On admission, 76 (58.5 %) and 45 (34.6 %) patients were positive for total and IgG antibody assays. Among 91 patients at discharge, 90 (98.9 %) and 81 (89.0 %) were positive for total and IgG antibody, respectively. Clinical background and laboratory findings on admission, but not the prevalence or concentration of total or IgG antibody, were associated with disease prognosis. Total and IgG antibody intensities were significantly higher in severe cases than in mild cases in serum collected >11 days after onset, but not within 10 days.Conclusion. VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG assays will be useful as supporting diagnostic and surveillance tools and for evaluation of humoral immune response to COVID-19. Optimal prediction of disease prognosis is made from considering both clinical history and laboratory findings."
1861,Dynamic Assay for Profiling Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies and Their ACE2/Spike RBD Neutralization Capacity.,"Serological assays have been widely employed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to measure antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to track seroconversion in populations. However, currently available assays do not allow determination of neutralization capacity within the assay protocol. Furthermore, commercial serology assays have a high buy-in cost that is inaccessible for many research groups. We have replicated the serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody isotypes, developed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. Additionally, we have modified the protocol to include a neutralization assay with only a minor modification to this protocol. We used this assay to screen local COVID-19 patient sera (n = 91) and pre-COVID-19 control sera (n = 103), and obtained approximate parity with approved commercial anti-nucleoprotein-based assays with these sera. Furthermore, data from our neutralization assay closely aligns with that generated using a spike-based pseudovirus infection model when a subset of patient sera was analyzed."

1863,COVID-19 diagnostic tests: importance of the clinical context.,"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses numerous health challenges, including the adequate use and proper interpretation of the different available tests in different clinical settings. As any diagnostic test, those of SARS-CoV-2 have methodological limitations of sensitivity (S) and specificity (E), which eventually determine their positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive value. Furthermore, their diagnostic performance depends on the clinical context in which these tests are used, that is, on the pretest probability. This article: (1) reviews the main methodological aspects that influence the S, E, PPV and NPV of the most common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests; and, (2) discusses its diagnostic interpretation in different clinical settings."
1864,Pulmonary long-term consequences of COVID-19 infections after hospital discharge.,"Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors are reporting residual abnormalities after discharge from hospital. Limited information is available about this stage of recovery or the lingering effects of the virus on pulmonary function and inflammation. This study aimed to describe lung function in patients recovering from COVID-19 hospitalization and to identify biomarkers in serum and induced sputum samples from these patients. Methods: Patients admitted to Spanish hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection by a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were recruited for this study. Each hospital screened their lists of discharged patients at least 45 days after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were divided into mild/moderate and severe disease groups according to the severity of their symptoms during hospitalization. Patients' epidemiological and medical histories, comorbidities, chronic treatments, and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Pulmonary function tests, the standardized 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and chest computed tomography (CT) were also performed. The levels of proteases, their inhibitors, and shed receptors were measured in serum and induced sputum samples. Results: A total of 100 patients with respiratory function tests were included in this study. The median number of days after the onset of symptoms was 104 (IQR 89.25, 126.75). COVID-19 was severe in 47% of patients (47/100). CT was normal in 48% of patients (48/100). Lung function was normal forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥80%, forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥80%, FEV1/FVC ≥0.7, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≥80% in 92% (92/100), 94% (94/100), 100% (100/100) and 48% (48/100) of patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that a DLCO <80% (OR 5.92; 95%CI 2.28-15.37; p < 0.0001) and a lower serum lactate dehydrogenase level (OR 0.98; 95%CI 0.97-0.99) were associated with the severe disease group of SARS-CoV-2 cases during hospital stay. Conclusions: A diffusion deficit (DLCO <80%) was still present after hospital discharge and was associated with the most severe SARS-CoV-2 cases."

Based on voluntary-based surveillance, they tested positive for different strains of SARS-CoV-2, as Spike gene sequencing showed. Five of them reported mild symptoms. Given the risk for SARS-CoV-2 introduction from asymptomatic vaccinees, this case series suggests the need to continue nasopharyngeal screening programmes."
1868,Imaging algorithm for COVID-19: A practical approach.,"The global pandemic of COVID-19 pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has strained healthcare resources across the world with emerging challenges of mass testing, resource allocation and management. While reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is the most commonly utilized test and considered the current gold standard for diagnosis, the role of chest imaging has been highlighted by several studies demonstrating high sensitivity of computed tomography (CT). Many have suggested using CT chest as a first-line screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, with advancement of laboratory testing and challenges in obtaining a CT scan without significant risk to healthcare providers, the role of imaging in diagnosis has been questioned. Several imaging societies have released consensus statements and guidelines on utilizing imaging resources and optimal reporting. In this review, we highlight the current evidence on various modalities in thoracic imaging for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and describe an algorithm on how to use these resources in an optimal fashion in accordance with the guidelines and statements released by major imaging societies."
