3571,Seropositivity rate and diagnostic accuracy of serological tests in 2019-nCoV cases: a pooled analysis of individual studies.,"Objective: Currently, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 (2019-nCoV). However, reliable and rapid serological diagnostic methods to screen SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, including those who do not have overt symptoms, are urgently needed. Most studies have described serological tests based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG. Here, we attempted to systematically analyze the positive rates and comprehensive diagnostic efficacy of IgM and IgG in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and methods: By systematically searching PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv and other databases, studies regarding the detection of peripheral blood IgM and/or IgG related to SARS-CoV-2 were collected. The positive rate, sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), area under the curve (AUC) and corresponding 95% CIs were obtained by weighted quantitative mergence, and the source of heterogeneity was explored by performing a subgroup study and sensitivity analysis. Results: A total of 30 studies were included, which were comprised of 3856 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases, 368 suspected RNA negative cases, 1167 asymptomatic carriers, and 2526 RNA negative controls. The corresponding meta-analysis showed that in confirmed cases with 2019-nCoV, the positive rates of single IgM, single IgG and their joint detection related to SARS-CoV-2 were 61.2% (95% CI: 53.4%-69.0%), 58.8% (95% CI: 49.6%-68.0%) and 62.1% (52.7%-71.4%), respectively. In suspected RNA negative cases, the positive rates of single IgM, single IgG and their joint detection were 29.0% (95% CI: 14.0%-44.0%), 37.0% (95% CI: 20.0%-55.0%) and 55.0% (95% CI: 19.0%-90.0%), respectively. Interestingly, IgM/IgG detection also demonstrated a positive rate of 19% (95% CI: 10.0%-27.0%) in asymptomatic cases. Using RT-PCR test as reference, the AUCs of IgM, IgG and IgM/IgG in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection were 0.9656, 0.9766, and 0.9838, respectively. The stratified analyses showed that among confirmed cases with 2019-nCoV, the positive rates of IgM and IgG were 27.3% (95%CI: 19.8%-34.8%) and 22.3% (95% CI: 11.3%-33.3%), respectively, 0-7days following the onset of symptoms, whereas the positive rate of parallel IgM/IgG testing attained 39.3% (95% CI: 24.2%-54.4%). Moreover, the efficacy of antibody testing based on CLIA (chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassays) in diagnosing 2019-nCoV infection was higher than that of LFIA (lateral flow immunoassays) and ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). Conclusions: IgM, IgG and their joint testing exhibited high clinical value in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV, which may assist in making up for the deficiency of throat swab RNA tests."
3572,COVIDIAGNOSTIX: health technology assessment of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Objective: In vitro diagnostic tests for SARS-COV-2, also known as serological tests, have rapidly spread. However, to date, mostly single-center technical and diagnostic performance's assessments have been carried out without an intralaboratory validation process and a health technology assessment (HTA) systematic approach. Therefore, the rapid HTA for evaluating antibody tests for SARS-COV-2 was applied. Methods: The use of rapid HTA is an opportunity to test innovative technology. Unlike traditional HTA (which evaluates the benefits of new technologies after being tested in clinical trials or have been applied in practice for some time), the rapid HTA is performed during the early stages of developing new technology. A multidisciplinary team conducted the rapid HTA following the HTA Core Model® (version 3.0) developed by the European Network for Health Technology Assessment. Results: The three methodological and analytical steps used in the HTA applied to the evaluation of antibody tests for SARS-COV-2 are reported: the selection of the tests to be evaluated; the research and collection of information to support the adoption and appropriateness of the technology; and the preparation of the final reports and their dissemination. Finally, the rapid HTA of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 is summarized in a report that allows its dissemination and communication. Conclusions: The rapid-HTA evaluation method, in addition to highlighting the characteristics that differentiate the tests from each other, guarantees a timely and appropriate evaluation, becoming a tool to create a direct link between science and health management."

3574,"COVID-19 in the New York City Jail System: Epidemiology and Health Care Response, March-April 2020.","Objectives: People detained in correctional facilities are at high risk for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We described the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak in a large urban jail system, including signs and symptoms at time of testing and risk factors for hospitalization. Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study included all patients aged ≥18 years who were tested for COVID-19 during March 11-April 28, 2020, while in custody in the New York City jail system (N = 978). We described demographic characteristics and signs and symptoms at the time of testing and performed Cox regression analysis to identify factors associated with hospitalization among those with a positive test result. Results: Of 978 people tested for COVID-19, 568 received a positive test result. Among symptomatic patients, the most common symptoms among those who received a positive test result were cough (n = 293 of 510, 57%) and objective fever (n = 288 of 510, 56%). Of 257 asymptomatic patients who were tested, 58 (23%) received a positive test result. Forty-five (8%) people who received a positive test result were hospitalized for COVID-19. Older age (aged ≥55 vs 18-34) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 13.41; 95% CI, 3.80-47.33) and diabetes mellitus (aHR = 1.99; 95% CI, 1.00-3.95) were significantly associated with hospitalization. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of people tested in New York City jails received a positive test result for COVID-19, including a large proportion of people tested while asymptomatic. During periods of ongoing transmission, asymptomatic screening should complement symptom-driven COVID-19 testing in correctional facilities. Older patients and people with diabetes mellitus should be closely monitored after COVID-19 diagnosis because of their increased risk for hospitalization."
3575,A 56-year-old man with RT-PCR negative nasopharyngeal swabs with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia.,"Introduction: Diagnostic procedure in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based mainly on performing real-time-reverse transcription-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR), which has been accepted as the gold standard method. In some cases, such as mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, variable viral load kinetics or laboratory errors, it can be false-negative. Case report: The case is presented of a 56-year-old man with respiratory tract symptoms, with twice negative results of real-time-reverse transcription-polymerase chain-reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs and positive chest computed tomography, with typical findings for COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions: Patients with negative RT-PCR results, but with positive computed tomography findings characteristic for COVID-19, should be treated as well as those infected."

3579,[A Practical Approach to the Management of Patients with Gastrointestinal Cancer during the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19)Pandemic-What Can Medical Oncologists Do?].,"The SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the healthcare system, including cancer treatments worldwide. Since March 2020 in Japan, cancer patients faced a crisis; they suffered from delays or restrictions in cancer treatment during the initial outbreak. At present, we can perform cancer treatment as usual. Most of the treatments depend on continuous infection control by cancer patients and their families. However, the need to recognize cancer treatment management during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial. Cancer treatment practice, purpose, risk factors, and the evidence during clinical trials should be comprehensively evaluated and adapted for each patient. Moreover, there is a need to discuss care planning between healthcare professionals, patients, and their families in advance. The COVID-19 vaccine could be essential for cancer patients. In this article, we review cancer treatment points for implementing whole-person care, including advanced care planning for patients with gastrointestinal malignancies, during the COVID-19 pandemic."
