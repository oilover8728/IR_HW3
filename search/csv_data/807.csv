8060,COVID-19 in a Mississippi Community Hospital.,"Objectives: Mississippi recorded the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on March 11, 2020. This report describes the initial COVID-19 experience of the single healthcare system serving Jackson County, Mississippi. The intent of this retrospective review of COVID-19 hospitalized patients was to identify any characteristics or interventions amenable to improving care management and clinical outcomes for patients within our community hospital. Methods: All hospitalized patients 18 years of age and older in our health system with positive tests for COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 [SARS CoV-2]) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March 15 and April 10, 2020 are included in this retrospective observational report. Results: During the study period, 158 patients of the 1384 tested (11.4%) were positive for COVID-19 infection. Of the 158 patients, 41 (26%) were hospitalized, with 17 (41%) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The remaining 24 patients did not require ICU admission. The mean age of the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 55 years (range 2-103). Obesity was noted in 68% of the hospitalized patients, including 13 (54%) of the non-ICU patients and 15 (88%) of the ICU patients. All 9 deceased patients were obese. Twelve of 17 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 3 patients received only high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Only 25% (3 of 12) of the IMV patients were successfully extubated during the study period. The median duration on IMV was 17 days (range 4-35). The mortality in the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 5.7% (9 of 158). None of the 24 non-ICU patients died. The ICU mortality rate was 53% (9 of 17). Conclusions: This report describes a community hospital experience with COVID-19. Patient outcome was comparable to that reported at larger centers. Obesity was a major comorbidity and correlated with adverse outcomes. Amidst the initial wave of COVID-19 with high demand for inpatient treatment, it is reassuring that appropriate care can be provided in a community health system."
8061,COVID-19: Insight into the asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection and transmission.,"The existence of a substantial but unclear number of asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 patients worldwide has raised concerns among global public health authorities. In this review, according to the published literature, we provided the evidence that asymptomatic infections can result in person-to-person transmission. Four studies suggested that the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients for at least two consecutive generations, indicating its strong infectivity. Asymptomatic infection tends to be, but is not only, identified among young people (<20 years old). The majority of asymptomatic patients appear to have a milder clinical course during hospitalization, but the severity of the symptoms of the secondary patients infected by SARS-COV-2 from asymptomatic patients varies with their physical constitution. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals among all confirmed cases widely differed (from 1.95% to 87.9%) according to the study setting and the populations studied. The increasing large-scale tests are expected to give more information about the true number of asymptomatic infections in the population. In China and other countries, various guidelines for management of asymptomatic cases have been issued. Importantly, early detection, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment of asymptomatic patients require the joint efforts of policy makers, clinicians, technicians, epidemiologists, virologists and patients."
8062,The Genetic Variant of SARS-CoV-2: would It Matter for Controlling the Devastating Pandemic?,"The pandemic of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is far from being controlled despite the great effort that have been taken throughout the world. Herd immunity through vaccination is our major expectation to rein the virus. However, the emergence of widespread genetic variants could potentially undermine the vaccines. The evidence that some variants could evade immune responses elicited by vaccines and previous infection is growing. In this review, we summarized the current understanding on five notable genetic variants, i.e., D614G, Cluster 5, VOC 202012/01, 501Y.V2 and P.1, and discussed the potential impact of these variants on the virus transmission, pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. We also highlight that mutations in the N-terminal domain of spike protein should be considered when evaluating the antibody neutralization abilities. Among these genetic variants, a concern of genetic variant 501Y.V2 to escape the protection by vaccines was raised. We therefore call for new vaccines targeting this variant to be developed."
8063,Is loss of sense of smell a diagnostic marker in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Aims: To systematically review the currently available evidence investigating the association between olfactory dysfunction (OD) and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). To analyse the prevalence of OD in patients who have tested positive on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19. To perform a meta-analysis of patients presenting with olfactory dysfunction, during the pandemic, and to investigate the positive predictive value for a COVID-19-positive result in this population. To assess whether olfactory dysfunction could be used as a diagnostic marker for COVID-19 positivity and aid public health approaches in tackling the current outbreak. Methods: We systematically searched MedLine (PubMed), Embase, Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC), Medrxiv, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, NIHR Dissemination centre, Clinical Evidence, National Health Service Evidence and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence to identify the current published evidence which associates coronaviridae or similar RNA viruses with anosmia. The initial search identified 157 articles. A total of 145 papers were excluded following application of our exclusion criteria. The 12 remaining articles that presented evidence on the association between COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction were critically analysed. Results: Olfactory dysfunction has been shown to be the strongest predictor of COVID-19 positivity when compared to other symptoms in logistic regression analysis. In patients who had tested positive for COVID-19, there was a prevalence of 62% of OD. In populations of patients who are currently reporting OD, there is a positive predictive value of 61% for a positive COVID-19 result. Conclusion: Our review has shown that there is already significant evidence which demonstrates an association between OD and the novel coronavirus-COVID-19. It is unclear if this finding is unique to this coronavirus as individual viral phenotypes rarely present in such concentrated large numbers. We have demonstrated that OD is comparatively more predictive for COVID-19 positivity compared to other associated symptoms. We recommend that people who develop OD during the pandemic should be self-isolate and this guidance should be adopted internationally to prevent transmission."
8064,SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in water and wastewater: A critical review about presence and concern.,"The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in water and wastewater has recently been reported. According to the updated literature, the stools and masks of the patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were considered as the primary route of coronavirus transmission into water and wastewater. Most coronavirus types which attack human (possible for SARS-CoV-2) are often inactivated rapidly in water (i.e., the survival of human coronavirus 229E in water being 7 day at 23 Â°C). However, the survival period of coronavirus in water environments strongly depends on temperature, property of water, concentration of suspended solids and organic matter, solution pH, and dose of disinfectant used. The World Health Organization has stated that the current disinfection process of drinking water could effectively inactivate most of the bacterial and viral communities present in water, especially SARS-CoV-2 (more sensitive to disinfectant like free chlorine). A recent study confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in inflow wastewater (but not detected in outflow one). Although the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in water influents has been confirmed, an important question is whether it can survive or infect after the disinfection process of drinking water. To date, only one study confirmed that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in water for people was null based on the absence of cytopathic effect (CPE) in infectivity tests. Therefore, further studies should focus on the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater under different operational conditions (i.e., temperature and water matrix) and whether the transmission from COVID-19-contaminated water to human is an emerging concern. Although paper-based devices have been suggested for detecting the traces of SARS-CoV-2 in water, the protocols and appropriate devices should be developed soon. Wastewater and sewage workers should follow the procedures for safety precaution against SARS-CoV-2 exposure."
8065,Construction and applications of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses: a mini review.,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a serious threat to global public health and social stability. There is an urgent need for understanding the nature and infection mechanism of the virus. Owing to its high infectivity and pathogenicity and lack of effective treatments, live SARS-CoV-2 has to be handled in biosafety level 3 laboratories, which has impeded research into SARS-CoV-2 and the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Pseudotyped viruses that lack certain gene sequences of the virulent virus are safer and can be investigated in biosafety level 2 laboratories, providing a useful virological tool for the study of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we will discuss the construction of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses based on different packaging systems, current applications, limitations, and further explorations."
8066,"Development of new vaccine target against SARS-CoV2 using envelope (E) protein: An evolutionary, molecular modeling and docking based study.","COVID-19 is one of the fatal pandemic throughout the world. For cellular fusion, its antigenic peptides are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans. Therefore, exploration into residual interaction details of CoV2 with MHCs shall be a promising point for instigating the vaccine development. Envelope (E) protein, the smallest outer surface protein from SARS-CoV2 genome was found to possess the highest antigenicity and is therefore used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Four novel mutations (T55S, V56F, E69R and G70del) were observed in E-protein of SARS-CoV2 after evolutionary analysis. It showed a coilâhelix transition in the protein conformation. Antigenic variability of the epitopes was also checked to explore the novel mutations in the epitope region. It was found that the interactions were more when SARS-CoV2 E-protein interacted with MHC-I than with MHC-II through several ionic and H-bonds. Tyr42 and Tyr57 played a predominant role upon interaction with MHC-I. The higher ÎG values with lesser dissociation constant values also affirm the stronger and spontaneous interaction by SARS-CoV2 proteins with MHCs. On comparison with the consensus E-protein, SARS-CoV2 E-protein showed stronger interaction with the MHCs with lesser solvent accessibility. E-protein can therefore be targeted as a potential vaccine target against SARS-CoV2."
8067,Evaluation of the relationship of serum vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients with clinical course and prognosis.,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, infected more than six million people in a short time. In COVID-19, the relationship of many laboratory parameters to morbidity and mortality has been defined. In our study, we aimed to determine the relationship of serum vitamin D level to clinical course and prognosis. Materials and methods: This study included 108 patients; 88 patients who stayed in Ataturk University and Erzurum City Hospital between March 24, 2020 and May 15, 2020, who were identified as COVID-19 by real-time PCR method from the nasopharyngeal swab and 20 asymptomatic voluntary medical personnel who tested negative for real-time PCR after routine check-up in our hospital. Result: In statistical analysis conducted between healthy control group and vitamin D levels of patients admitted due to COVID-19, it was observed that patients infected with COVID-19 had a lower level (p= 0.004). In 20 patients developing MAS, a lower level of vitamin D was observed (p= 0.004) compared to 68 patients who did not develop. In the comparison of vitamin D levels of the patients (n= 8) who developed exitus in their follow up due to COVID-19, it was observed that vitamin D levels were statistically significantly lower compared to the living (p= 0.009). Conclusions: Due to COVID-19, pandemic, long-running quarantines caused insufficient use of sunlight and worsening of vitamin D deficiency. We wanted to draw attention again with our study to vitamin D which can be responsible for the heavy clinical course of COVID-19 and whose replacement is easy to apply."
8068,Immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and early clinical outcomes in patients with haematological malignancies in Lithuania: a national prospective cohort study.,"Background: Haematological malignancies and their treatments are likely to affect SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy. We aimed to evaluate serological response to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with haematological malignancies by type of treatment. Methods: Our national prospective cohort study was done in Lithuania and assessed serological response to one and two BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine doses in healthy health-care workers and in patients with haematological malignancies. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had received both vaccine doses, and had available biobanked blood samples from before vaccination and after the second dose. Biobanked samples and health data were obtained from Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos Biobank. Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II chemiluminescent microparticle assay was used to quantify serum anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG antibody (anti-S1 IgG antibody) concentrations 0-10 days before the first BNT162b2 vaccine, on the day of second immunisation (around day 21), and 7 to 21 days after the second immunisation. Adverse events were assessed by a standardised questionnaire. Breakthrough infections were characterised clinically and by SARS-CoV-2 genotyping whenever possible. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04871165. Findings: Between Jan 8 and April 21, 2021, 885 participants with haematological malignancies were included in the study. 857 patients were anti-S1 IgG seronegative at timepoint 0 and constituted the main analysis cohort. The age-matched comparison was made between 315 patients with haematological malignancies who were aged 18-60 years and 67 healthy health-care workers in the same age group. Patients aged 18-60 years with haematological malignancies had lower median anti-S1 IgG antibody responses after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses than did health-care workers of the same age group (median 6961 AU/mL [IQR 1292-20 672] vs 21 395 AU/mL [14 831-33 553]; p<0Â·0001). Compared with untreated patients with haematological malignancies (n=53; median 5761 AU/mL [629-16 141]), patients actively treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKIs; n=44; 0 AU/mL [0-7]; p<0Â·0001), ruxolitinib (n=16; 10 AU/mL [0-45]; p<0Â·0001), venetoclax (n=10; 4 AU/mL [0-1218]; p=0Â·0005), or anti-CD20 antibody therapy (n=87; 17 AU/mL [1-2319]; p<0Â·0001) showed particularly poor anti-S1 IgG antibody responses following two BNT162b2 doses. Patients being treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (n=41; 10 537 AU/mL [IQR 2335-19 388]) or patients who received autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT; n=192; 6203 AU/mL [1451-16 834]) or allogeneic HSCT (n=122; 6304 AU/mL [1120-16 913]) were among the subgroups with the highest numerical responses. Nine SARS-CoV-2 infections and three COVID-19 deaths were observed among fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies. Interpretation: Patients with haematological malignancies mount blunted and heterogeneous antibody responses to the full course of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Patients who are actively treated with BTKIs, ruxolitinib, venetoclax, or anti-CD20 antibody therapies seem to be the most negatively affected and might be left unprotected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Breakthrough severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies emphasise the importance of ongoing strict adherence to non-pharmacological interventions and household vaccination while SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in the community.

8069,SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer: Evidence for and against a role of SARS-CoV-2 in cancer onset.,"Despite huge efforts towards understanding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis, little is known about the long-term consequences of the disease. Here, we critically review existing literature about oncogenesis as a potential long-term effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like other viral infections, SARS-CoV-2 may promote cancer onset by inhibiting tumor suppressor genes. We conclude that, although unlikely, such hypothesis cannot be excluded a priori and we delineate an experimental approach to address it.
