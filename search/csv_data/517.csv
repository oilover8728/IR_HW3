5161,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination intentions among mothers of children aged 9 to 12 years: a survey of the All Our Families cohort.,"Background: Acceptance of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is critical to achieving high levels of immunization. The objectives of this study were to understand mothers' SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions to explore reasons for and against SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Methods: Participants from the All Our Families pregnancy longitudinal cohort whose children had reached ages 9-12 years were invited in May-June 2020 to complete a survey on the impact of COVID-19. The survey covered topics about the impact of the pandemic and included 2 specific questions on mothers' intentions to vaccinate their child against SARS-CoV-2. Current responses were linked to previously collected data, including infant vaccine uptake. Multinomial regression models were run to estimate associations between demographic factors, past vaccination status and vaccination intention. Qualitative responses regarding factors affecting decision-making were analyzed thematically. Results: The response rate was 53.8% (1321/2455). A minority of children of participants had partial or no vaccinations at age 2 (n = 200, 15.1%). A total of 60.4% of mothers (n = 798) intended to vaccinate their children with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 8.6% (n = 113) did not intend to vaccinate and 31.0% (n = 410) were unsure. Lower education, lower income and incomplete vaccination history were inversely associated with intention to vaccinate. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses showed 10 themes, including safety and efficacy, long-term effects and a rushed process. Interpretation: Within a cohort with historically high infant vaccination, a third of mothers remained unsure about vaccinating their children against SARS-CoV-2. Given the many uncertainties about future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, clear communication regarding safety will be critical to ensuring vaccine uptake."
5162,Developing-country vaccine manufacturers' technical capabilities can make a difference in global immunization.,"Members of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers' Network (DCVMN) have been actively engaged in the development of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. According to the WHO COVID-19 vaccine landscape updated on 29 December 2020, 18 member manufacturers had vaccines in preclinical or clinical trials, including three members with candidates in Phase III trials. Once successful candidates have been identified there will be a need for large scale vaccine manufacturing and supply, in which DCVMN member manufacturers can play a key role. In an internal survey in 2019, DCVMN members reported the capability to supply over 3.5 billion vaccine doses annually, and the provision of over 50 distinct vaccines to 170 countries. To describe the capabilities of DCVMN member manufacturers more precisely, a 121-question survey was circulated to 41 Network members. The survey assessed the manufacturers' capabilities in utilizing various technology platforms, cell cultures and filling technologies, in addition to their capacities for manufacturing drug products. The survey also evaluated manufacturers' preparedness to dedicate existing capacities to COVID-19 vaccine production. Results revealed that sampled manufacturers have strong capabilities for manufacturing vaccines based on recombinant technologies, particularly with mammalian cells, and microbial and yeast expression systems. Capabilities in utilizing cell cultures were distributed across multiple cell types, however manufacturing capacities with Vero and CHO cells were prominent. Formulating and filling findings illustrated further large-scale capabilities of Network members. Sampled manufacturers reported that over 50% of their capacity for vaccine manufacturing could be dedicated to COVID-19 vaccine production."
5163,Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes in France.,"Objectives: The objective of the study is to investigate the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes in France. Study design: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among a representative sample of the French population between November 20th and 23rd 2020 (N = 1146). Methods: Factors associated with the intention to get vaccinated and with COVID-19 vaccine attitudes were estimated using ordered logistic and multinomial logistic regressions, respectively. Independent variables of interest include COVID-19 and vaccine perceptions, trust, endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and time/risk preferences. Results: Only 30.5% of our respondents would agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19 during the first semester of 2021 while 31.1% declare being unsure of their vaccination intentions. COVID-19 risk perceptions are associated with vaccination intentions and attitudes. Individual and collective benefits of the vaccine and the concerns over its safety are strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes. Vaccine acceptors are more willing to take risks in the health domain compared with vaccine hesitant respondents which indicates that the COVID-19 vaccine is perceived as a greater health risk than the COVID-19 itself by some respondents. We also find a positive association between future preference and the willingness to get vaccinated. Conclusion: Awareness campaigns should be conducted to enhance vaccination uptake among vaccine hesitant individuals. These campaigns could highlight the positive benefit-risk balance of the COVID-19 vaccines or the short-term benefits of vaccination and should reinsure the public on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines."

5165,"Virology, Clinical Features and Diagnosis of COVID 19: Review Analysis.","COVID-19 requires unprecedented mobilization of the health systems to prevent the rapid spread of this unique virus, which spreads via respiratory droplet and causes respiratory disease. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify many infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of the patients. This article aims as an outcome of review of the evidence on viral load and its virulence of SARS-CoV2,so that it will help in further understanding the fact useful for investigating and managing the COVID-19 cases. A search of available evidence was conducted in pub-med ""COVID-19 viral load and virulence"" and its associated characters world-wide and Google Scholar to capture the most recently published articles. The WHO and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database of publications on novel coronavirus were also screened for relevant publications. Abstracts of 55 articles were screened by two authors and 15 were included in this study based on the inclusion criteria. SARS-coV2, the causative agent of COVID-19 falls under the coronavirus family but it has higher infectivity compared to SARS and MERS with higher reproduction numbers(Ro). Virulence has been found to be different throughout the world,however lower compared to SARS and MERS,till date. The most common clinical features have been found to be cough and fever. RT - PCR remains the most sensitive and specific method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 although it is time consuming, costly and requires highly skilled human resources. Hence, newer modalities like RT- LAMP can be alternative for point of care diagnosis as this is both cost effective and requires less skilled human resources. Despite recent advances in disease diagnosis and treatment outcomes using latest technological advances in molecular biology, the global pandemic COVID-19 remains a major headache for governments across the world due to limited testing capacity and lack of appropriate treatment and vaccine."
5166,Walk-Through Screening Center for COVID-19: an Accessible and Efficient Screening System in a Pandemic Situation.,"With the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of individuals that need to be tested for COVID-19 has been rapidly increasing. A walk-through (WT) screening center using negative pressure booths that is inspired by the biosafety cabinet has been designed and implemented in Korea for easy screening of COVID-19 and for safe and efficient consultation for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. Here, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 WT screening center. The WT center increases patient access to the screening clinics and adequately protects healthcare personnel while reducing the consumption of personal protective equipment. It can also increase the number of people tested by 9-10 fold. However, there is a risk of cross-infection at each stage of screening treatment, including the booths, and adverse reactions with disinfection of the booths. These limitations can be overcome using mobile technology and increasing the number of booths to reduce congestion inside the center, reducing booth volume for sufficient and rapid ventilation, and using an effective, harmless, and certified environmental disinfectant. A WT center can be implemented in other institutions and countries and modified depending on local needs to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic."
5167,Male predominance in disease severity and mortality in a low Covid-19 epidemic and low case-fatality area - a population-based registry study.,"Background: Men reportedly suffer from a more severe disease and higher mortality during the global SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic. We analysed sex differences in a low epidemic area with low overall mortality in Covid-19 in a population based setting with patients treated in specialized healthcare. Methods: We entered all hospitalized laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases of all specialized healthcare hospitals of the Capital Province of Finland, into a population-based quality registry and described demographics, severity and case-fatality by sex of the first Covid-19 wave February-June 2020. Results: Altogether 5471 patients (49% male) were identified. Patients hospitalized in the specialist healthcare (N = 585, 54% male, OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.05-1.48) were of the same age. Men had less asthma and thyroid insufficiency and more coronary artery disease compared to women. Mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was at least one day longer for men (p=.005). Men required intensive care unit (ICU) more often (27% vs. 17%) with longer lengths-of-stays at ICU. Male sex associated with significantly higher case-fatality at 90-days (15% vs. 8%) and all excess male deaths occurring after three weeks from onset. Men with fatal outcomes had delays in both Covid-19 testing and hospital admission after a positive test. The delays in patients with the most severe and fatal outcomes differed markedly by sex. In multivariable analysis, male sex associated independently with case-fatality (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.22-4.59). Conclusions: Male sex associated with higher disease severity and case-fatality. Late presentation of male fatal cases could represent different treatment-seeking behaviour or disease progression by sex."
5168,The PANDEMIC framework for encouraging COVID-19 vaccinations.,"After sufficient doses are manufactured and logistical barriers are reduced, convincing an overwhelming majority of people to receive a COVID-19 vaccination may be the next major challenge during this pandemic. A group of experts recently proposed strategies that have compelling rationales and are well grounded in behavioral science. However, their approaches may sometimes be unacceptable, impractical, and/or unsuccessful. Therefore, other strategies will be greatly needed to address vaccine hesitancy. The present commentary offers 8 additional promising approaches forming a framework known as PANDEMIC. This acronym stands for the following strategies: presumptive language, asking for advice, norms on an anonymous level, description of favorable attributes, emphasizing clinicians' own experiences, mandated choice, images, and communication of risk. Each of the strategies is discussed in turn. Many of the proposed strategies have empirical support for achieving desired outcomes in other domains. However, the PANDEMIC framework is untested in regard to increasing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. Therefore, the strategies should be carefully evaluated before they are widely disseminated through public health announcements, email distribution lists, electronic health record messages, and other outlets."
