7751,Outcomes and Impact of a Universal COVID-19 Screening Protocol for Asymptomatic Oncology Patients.,"Introduction: COVID-19 has become a serious hazard worldwide in a relatively short time. Scientific evidence supports that cancer patients infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing severe complications. COVID-19 patients can be asymptomatic during part or all of their disease course, therefore it is a compelling need to develop universal pre-interventional COVID-19 screening guidelines. The aim of this study is to is review COVID-19 positive rate among asymptomatic cancer patients since the implementation of universal policy at our institution, and assess the impact of diagnosing COVID-19 on delay of oncologic interventions. Materials and methods: The study population comprised of all cancer patients planned for high risk interventions between April 1, 2020 - May 14, 2020 at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi [CCAD] after implementing universal COVID-19 screening policy. Discussion: Nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 among cancer patients could result in poor outcomes. Universal screening for high-risk populations may facilitate earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 and implementation of control strategies. Our review demonstrated that [7.5%] of asymptomatic cancer patients tested positive for COVID-19 after implementation of universal prospective screening policy. The overall evidence supporting universal COVID-19 screening of cancer patients is limited, yet as tests become more widely available, it may be reasonable to screen all cancer patients for COVID-19 before anticancer therapies. While such policy may delay and affect the timing of anticancer therapy as shown in this report, it should improve the safety of care for oncology patients and help protect healthcare workers. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection rate is higher in cancer patients than general population and can present without symptoms. Universal COVID-19 screening of cancer patients before high risk interventions is supported by the present findings."

It includes data on Australian cases notified during the week 26 January to 1 February 2020 and in the previous week (19 to 25 January 2020), the international situation and current information on the severity, transmission and spread of the 2019-nCoV infection."

7756,[Echocardiographic examinations in times of the COVID-19 pandemic : International recommendations and implementation].,"Since its first appearance in December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world at a rapid pace causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Originating from the Chinese province Hubei, more than 29.4 million people globally have now been confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus and more than 930,000 patients have died so far from COVID-19 (situation as of 15 September 2020). The virus is mainly spread during close contact by small droplets and aerosols. During the close contact in medical examinations, such as echocardiography, the risk of contracting the virus is increased. Therefore, the use of personal protective equipment is recommended for the protection of patients and medical personnel alike. This article summarizes the current recommendations of international societies and describes the local implementation in Austria."
7757,"Multiple Early Introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Cape Town, South Africa.","Cape Town was the first city in South Africa to experience the full impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We acquired samples from all suspected cases and their contacts during the first month of the pandemic from Tygerberg Hospital. Nanopore sequencing generated SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes. Phylogenetic inference with maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were used to determine lineages that seeded the local epidemic. Three patients were known to have travelled internationally and an outbreak was detected in a nearby supermarket. Sequencing of 50 samples produced 46 high-quality genomes. The sequences were classified as lineages: B, B.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.1.161, B.1.1.29, B.1.8, B.39, and B.40. All the sequences from persons under investigation (PUIs) in the supermarket outbreak (lineage B.1.8) fall within a clade from the Netherlands with good support (p > 0.9). In addition, a new mutation, 5209A>G, emerged within the Cape Town cluster. The molecular clock analysis suggests that this occurred around 13 March 2020 (95% confidence interval: 9-17 March). The phylogenetic reconstruction suggests at least nine early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Cape Town and an early localized transmission in a shopping environment. Genomic surveillance was successfully used to investigate and track the spread of early introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Cape Town."
