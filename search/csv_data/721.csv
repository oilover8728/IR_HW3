7200,The race to treat COVID-19: Potential therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.,"The unforeseen emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the Wuhan province of China in December 2019, subsequently its abrupt spread across the world has severely affected human life. In a short span of time, COVID-19 has sacked more than one million human lives and marked as a severe global pandemic, which is drastically accountable for the adverse effect directly to the human society, particularly the health care system and the economy. The unavailability of approved and effective drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 further created conditions more adverse and terrifying. To win the war against this pandemic within time there is a desperate need for the most adequate therapeutic treatment, which can be achieved by the collaborative research work among scientists worldwide. In continuation of our efforts to support the scientific community, a review has been presented which discusses the structure and the activity of numerous molecules exhibiting promising SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs inhibition activities. Furthermore, this review offers an overview of the structure, a plausible mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, and crucial structural features substantial to inhibit the primary virus-based and host-based targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 treatment. We anticipate optimistically that this perspective will provide the reader and researcher's better understanding regarding COVID-19 and pave the path in the direction of COVID-19 drug discovery and development paradigm."

7202,Development of Wastewater Pooled Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from Congregate Living Settings.,"Wastewater-based monitoring for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the individual building level could be an efficient, passive means of early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Preliminary samples were collected from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side by side to assess feasibility, performance, and sensitivity. Refined sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n = 105 and 66) over 8 weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24-h composite collection had a sensitivity of 96.2% and a specificity of 100%. However, the method could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. If the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive, then the sensitivity is 100% and specificity drops to 45%. It was determined that the proposed approach constitutes a highly sensitive wastewater surveillance method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, but it could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding. Future work must focus on approaches to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to fully realize the potential of building wastewater as a surveillance tool for congregate living. IMPORTANCE Some of the most severe outbreaks of COVID-19 have taken place in places where persons live together, such as nursing homes. Wastewater testing from individual buildings could be used for frequent pooled surveillance of virus from all occupants, including those who are contagious, with or without symptoms. This work provides a sensitive practical method for detecting infected individuals, as validated in two building complexes housing occupants who underwent frequent clinical testing performed by external entities. Although this sensitive method could be deployed now for pooled surveillance as an early warning system to limit outbreaks, the study shows that the approach will require further refinement to differentiate contagious, newly infected individuals from persons who have persistent viral fragments shedding in their stool outside the contagious period."
7203,Palms and soles itchiness as a side effect of COVID-19 vaccination.,"Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that has no definite treatment or preventive medication until late 2020 when vaccines were developed. Vaccines are a very useful new tool against COVID-19 that stimulate the immune system after recognition of viruses or their parts. Complications post vaccination could happen and they depend on the types, vaccine mechanism of action as well as some other patients' factors. Case report: We are reporting a 39 years old lady who is known as allergic to a strawberry and kiwi, otherwise medically free. She presented to the outpatient unit with a ten-days history of palms of the hands and soles of the feet itchiness that is associated with occasional redness after receiving the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination. There were no skin rashes or pruritis at any other sites. The patient was treated conservatively by antihistamine and the symptoms gradually resolved within five days. Conclusion: Allergic reaction is one of the expected complications post any COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 vaccination. Although the type, distributions and severity of allergic reactions are variable from person to another, yet isolated itching to palms and soles could be a rare side effect post first dose of COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech) which is worth reporting. This presentation could be a type of allergic reaction which may require holding further doses, debate is there for further case reporting, research or evaluation. Learning points."
7204,Effect of transfusion convalescent recovery plasma in patients with coronavirus disease 2019.,"Objectives: To evaluate curative effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients by the transfusion of other convalescent plasma. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 18 patients with severe and critical COVID-19, who were hospitalized in the ICU of Xianghu Branch of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from February 1 to March 15, 2020. Patients were subdivided into an experimental group (n=6, who had transfused the plasma) and an observation group (n=12, who had no plasma transfusion). Basic clinical data and prognosis indexes of these two groups were compared. Moreover, for the experimental group, the dynamic changes of blood oxygen saturation before and after the transfusion, the changes of lymphocyte absolute value 48 hours after the transfusion, and the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid were analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences in age, gender, blood type and other basic clinical data between the two groups (all P>0.05).There were no significant differences in ventilator machine weaning time, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) weaning time, body temperature recovery to normal time, and hospitalization days between these two groups (all P>0.05). For the experimental group, before, during and after the convalescent plasma transfusion, the blood oxygen saturation of all 6 patients at all time (1, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h) was more than 90%, and there was no significant fluctuation. There were 3 patients whose absolute value of lymphocyte was increased 48 hours after the transfusion, and the remaining was decreased. There were 5 patients whose SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection turned negative 48 hours after the transfusion, accounting for 83.3%. Conclusions: Transfusion of convalescent plasma will not affect outcomesof COVID-19 patients, which can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in patients and reduce the loading capacity of SARS-CoV-2."

7207,"University students' perspectives, planned uptake, and hesitancy regarding the COVID-19 vaccine: A multi-methods study.","Purpose: To investigate university students' willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them. Method: A multi-methods approach was used-online convenience sample surveys and semi-structured interviews-of young adults attending a large Canadian public university. Two survey samples were collected (June 20-July 28, 2020 and September 22-October 17, 2020). Semi-structured interviews were conducted following each survey, interviewing 20 students in each round. Results: In June 77.8% of surveyed students (n = 483) were willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine; in September 79.6% were willing (n = 1269). Multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses found that increasing perception of the severity of COVID-19 predicted the likelihood that a respondent was willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine in both surveys. In the latter survey students who indicated they would be encouraged to get the COVID-19 vaccine if their doctor/pharmacist recommended it were 76 times more likely to be willing to get the vaccine than those who would not be encouraged by medical advice. Interviews revealed concerns about the speed of the vaccine roll out, safety, and efficacy. Conclusions: The majority of university students intend to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but there are nuanced concerns about efficacy and safety that must be taken into account by public health authorities as the vaccine becomes available to this group. Ensuring that family doctors, pharmacists, and other front-line healthcare workers have consistent and clear information regarding the benefits of vaccination will be critical to encouraging uptake among young adults."
7208,Virucidal Efficacy of Blue LED and Far-UVC Light Disinfection against Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus as a Model for SARS-CoV-2.,"Transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs through respiratory droplets passed directly from person to person or indirectly through fomites, such as common use surfaces or objects. The aim of this study was to determine the virucidal efficacy of blue LED (405 nm) and far-UVC (222 nm) light in comparison to standard UVC (254 nm) irradiation for the inactivation of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) on different matrices as a model for SARS-CoV-2. Wet or dried FIPV on stainless steel, plastic, or paper discs, in the presence or absence of artificial saliva, were exposed to various wavelengths of light for different time periods (1-90 min). Dual activity of blue LED and far-UVC lights were virucidal for most wet and dried FIPV within 4 to 16 min on all matrices. Individual action of blue LED and far-UVC lights were virucidal for wet FIPV but required longer irradiation times (8-90 min) to reach a 4-log reduction. In comparison, LED (265 nm) and germicidal UVC (254 nm) were virucidal on almost all matrices for both wet and dried FIPV within 1 min exposure. UVC was more effective for the disinfection of surfaces as compared to blue LED and far-UVC individually or together. However, dual action of blue LED and far-UVC was virucidal. This combination of lights could be used as a safer alternative to traditional UVC."
7209,Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S Protein Binds to Glycans of the Lactosamine Family in vitro.,"Many viruses, beside binding to their main cell target, interact with other molecules that promote virus adhesion to the cell; often, these additional targets are glycans. The main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is a peptide motif in the ACE2 protein. We studied interaction of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with an array of glycoconjugates, including various sialylated, sulfated, and other glycans, and found that the S protein binds some (but not all) glycans of the lactosamine family. We suggest that parallel influenza infection will promote SARS-CoV-2 adhesion to the respiratory epithelial cells due to the unmasking of lactosamine chains by the influenza virus neuraminidase."
