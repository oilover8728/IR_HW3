1760,Transmission risk of patients with COVID-19 meeting discharge criteria should be interpreted with caution.,"As of Apr. 22, 2020, the World Health Organization (2020) has reported over 2.4 million confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 169 151 deaths. Recent articles have uncovered genomic characteristics and clinical features of COVID-19 (Chan et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020), while our understanding of COVID-19 is still limited. As suggested by guidelines promoted by the General Office of National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (2020) (from Versions 1 to 6), discharged standards for COVID-19 were still dependent on viral real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests of respiratory specimens, showing that recovered COVID-19 patients with twice negative RT-PCR could meet discharge criteria. Here, we examined two cases in which nucleic acid test results were inconsistent with clinical and radiological findings, leading to suboptimal care."
1761,Occurrence and Timing of Subsequent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Reverse-transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Positivity Among Initially Negative Patients.,"Using data for 20 912 patients from 2 large academic health systems, we analyzed the frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test discordance among individuals initially testing negative by nasopharyngeal swab who were retested on clinical grounds within 7 days. The frequency of subsequent positivity within this window was 3.5% and was similar across institutions."
1762,COVID-19: advance in laboratory diagnostic strategy and technology.,"SARS-CoV-2 is one of the beta-coronaviruses with the spike protein. It invades host cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This newly discovered virus can result in excessive inflammation and immune pathological damage, as shown by a decreased number of peripheral lymphocytes, increased levels of cytokines, and damages of lung, heart, liver, kidney, and other organs. Effective therapeutic modalities such as new antiviral drugs and vaccines against this emerging virus need to be thoroughly studied and developed. However, so far the only recognized but mild progress in this area is the screening of old drugs for new uses. Therefore, rapid and accurate laboratory SARS-CoV-2 testing approaches are the important basis of identification and blockage of COVID-19 transmission. For COVID-19 patients with different clinical classifications (mild, common, severe, and critically severe), dynamic monitoring of functional indicators of susceptible and vital organs is an important strategy for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. In this review, we summarized SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostic schemes, pathophysiological indices of tissues and organs of COVID-19 patients, and laboratory diagnostic strategies for distinct disease stages. Further, we discussed the importance of hierarchical management and dynamic observation in SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostics. We then summed up the advance in SARS-CoV-2 testing technology and described the prospect of intelligent medicine in the prevention of infectious disease outbreaks."
1763,Biomimetic Virus-Like Particles as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Diagnostic Tools.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible disease that has affected more than 90% of the countries worldwide. At least 17 million individuals have been infected, and some countries are still battling first or second waves of the pandemic. Nucleic acid tests, especially reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), have become the workhorse for early detection of COVID-19 infection. Positive controls for the molecular assays have been developed to validate each test and to provide high accuracy. However, most available positive controls require cold-chain distribution and cannot serve as full-process control. To overcome these shortcomings, we report the production of biomimetic virus-like particles (VLPs) as SARS-CoV-2 positive controls. A SARS-CoV-2 detection module for RT-PCR was encapsidated into VLPs from a bacteriophage and a plant virus. The chimeric VLPs were obtained either by in vivo reconstitution and coexpression of the target detection module and coat proteins or by in vitro assembly of purified detection module RNA sequences and coat proteins. These VLP-based positive controls mimic SARS-CoV-2 packaged ribonucleic acid (RNA) while being noninfectious. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the positive controls are scalable, stable, and can serve broadly as controls, from RNA extraction to PCR in clinical settings."
1764,"The coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in pregnancy: risks, benefits, and recommendations.","The coronavirus disease 2019 has caused over 2 million deaths worldwide, with over 412,000 deaths reported in Unites States. To date, at least 57,786 pregnant women in the United States have been infected, and 71 pregnant women have died. Although pregnant women are at higher risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019-related illness, clinical trials for the available vaccines excluded pregnant and lactating women. The safety and efficacy of the vaccines for pregnant women, the fetus, and the newborn remain unknown. A review of maternal and neonatal coronavirus disease 2019 morbidity and mortality data along with perinatal vaccine safety considerations are presented to assist providers with shared decision-making regarding vaccine administration for this group, including the healthcare worker who is pregnant, lactating, or considering pregnancy. The coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine should be offered to pregnant women after discussing the lack of safety data, with preferential administration for those at highest risk of severe infection, until safety and efficacy of these novel vaccines are validated."
1765,Challenges in Laboratory Diagnosis of the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"The recent outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread worldwide since its discovery in Wuhan city, China in December 2019. A comprehensive strategy, including surveillance, diagnostics, research, clinical treatment, and development of vaccines, is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. The past three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus infections at the beginning of the 21st century have highlighted the importance of readily available, accurate, and rapid diagnostic technologies to contain emerging and re-emerging pandemics. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) based assays performed on respiratory specimens remain the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. However, point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging with high sensitivity and specificity as well. Even though excellent techniques are available for the diagnosis of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 in well-equipped laboratories; critical gaps still remain in screening asymptomatic people who are in the incubation phase of the virus, as well as in the accurate determination of live viral shedding during convalescence to inform decisions for ending isolation. This review article aims to discuss the currently available laboratory methods and surveillance technologies available for the detection of COVID-19, their performance characteristics and highlight the gaps in current diagnostic capacity, and finally, propose potential solutions. We also summarize the specifications of the majority of the available commercial kits (PCR, EIA, and POC) for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19."
