8360,Replication Kinetics of B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern Including Assessment of a B.1.1.7 Mutant Carrying a Defective ORF7a Gene.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, is a readily transmissible and potentially deadly pathogen which is currently re-defining human susceptibility to pandemic viruses in the modern world. The recent emergence of several genetically distinct descendants known as variants of concern (VOCs) is further challenging public health disease management, due to increased rates of virus transmission and potential constraints on vaccine effectiveness. We report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs imported into Australia belonging to the B.1.351 lineage, first described in the Republic of South Africa (RSA), and the B.1.1.7 lineage originally reported in the United Kingdom, and directly compare the replication kinetics of these two VOCs in Vero E6 cells. In this analysis, we also investigated a B.1.1.7 VOC (QLD1516/2021) carrying a 7-nucleotide deletion in the open reading frame 7a (ORF7a) gene, likely truncating and rendering the ORF7a protein of this virus defective. We demonstrate that the replication of the B.1.351 VOC (QLD1520/2020) in Vero E6 cells can be detected earlier than the B.1.1.7 VOCs (QLD1516/2021 and QLD1517/2021), before peaking at 48 h post infection (p.i.), with significantly higher levels of virus progeny. Whilst replication of the ORF7a defective isolate QLD1516/2021 was delayed longer than the other viruses, slightly more viral progeny was produced by the mutant compared to the unmutated isolate QLD1517/2021 at 72 h p.i. Collectively, these findings contribute to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 replication and evolutionary dynamics, which have important implications in the development of future vaccination, antiviral therapies, and epidemiological control strategies for COVID-19."
8361,Target specific serologic analysis of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.,"This study compared the performance of four serology assays for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and investigated whether COVID-19 disease history correlates with assay performance. Samples were tested at Northshore using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics), Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG anti-RBD (Beckman Coulter), and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (DiaSorin) as well as at Genalyte using Maverick Multi-Antigen Serology Panel. The study included one hundred clinical samples collected before December 2019 and ninety-seven samples collected from convalescent plasma donors originally diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR. COVID-19 disease history was self-reported by the plasma donors. There was no difference in specificity between the assays tested. Clinical sensitivity of these four tests was 98% (Genalyte), 96% (Roche), 92% (DiaSorin), and 87% (Beckman). The only statistically significant differences in clinical sensitivity was between the Beckman assay and both Genalyte and Roche assays. Convalescent plasma donor characteristics and disease symptoms did not correlate with false negative results from the Beckman and DiaSorin assays. All four tests showed high specificity (100%) and varying sensitivities (89-98%). No correlations between disease history and serology results were observed. The Genalyte Multiplex assay showed as good or better sensitivity to three other previously validated assays with FDA Emergency Use Authorizations."
8362,Challenges at the host-arthropod-coronavirus interface and COVID-19: a One Health approach.,"Background: The world faces the challenge posed by the interaction between hosts and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with potential role for arthropod vectors, and the effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants on acquired immunity, vaccine efficacy and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic control. Proposal: The characterization of the role played by animal hosts and host-virus interactions is essential to address this challenge. Zoonotic (animal-to-human) and reverse zoonotic (human-to-animal) routes may be involved in virus transmission with a possible still unconfirmed role for arthropod vectors. Herein we propose to consider the risks posed by the possible role of arthropod vectors in COVID-19 and that immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may increase the risk for zoonotic virus transmission. These risks should be considered when evaluating vaccine efficacy and monitoring animal SARS-CoV-2 variants. Conclusion: Virus surveillance, epidemiology, sequencing and evaluation of susceptibility to antibodies and other protective immune mechanisms from vaccinated individuals should be improved. A One Health approach such as the one applied by our group SaBio is necessary for a more effective control of COVID-19 and prevention of future pandemics."
8363,"Inequalities in coverage of COVID-19 vaccination: A population register based cross-sectional study in Wales, UK.","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted existing health inequalities for ethnic minority groups and those living in more socioeconomically deprived areas in the UK. With higher levels of severe outcomes in these groups, equitable vaccination coverage should be prioritised. The aim of this study was to identify inequalities in coverage of COVID-19 vaccination in Wales, UK and to highlight areas which may benefit from routine enhanced surveillance and targeted interventions. Records within the Wales Immunisation System (WIS) population register were linked to the Welsh Demographic Service Dataset (WDSD) and central list of shielding patients, held within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Ethnic group was derived from the 2011 census and over 20 administrative electronic health record (EHR) data sources. Uptake of first dose of any COVID-19 vaccine was analysed over time, with the odds of being vaccinated as at 25th April 2021 by sex, health board of residence, rural/urban classification, deprivation quintile and ethnic group presented. Using logistic regression models, analyses were adjusted for age group, care home resident status, health and social care worker status and shielding status. This study included 1,256,412 individuals aged 50 years and over. Vaccine coverage increased steadily from 8th December 2020 until mid-April 2021. Overall uptake of first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in this group was 92.1%. After adjustment the odds of being vaccinated were lower for individuals who were male, resident in the most deprived areas, resident in an urban area and an ethnic group other than White. The largest inequality was seen between ethnic groups, with the odds of being vaccinated 0.22 (95 %CI 0.21-0.24) if in any Black ethnic group compared to any White ethnic group. Ongoing monitoring of inequity in uptake of vaccinations is required, with better targeted interventions and engagement with deprived and ethnic communities to improve vaccination uptake."
8364,Evaluation of performance of two SARS-CoV-2 Rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody tests on capillary whole blood samples from the fingertip.,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2) is responsible for the infectious respiratory disease called COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019). In response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic, point-of-care (POC) tests have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood. We conducted a prospective observational study to evaluate the performance of two POC tests, COVID-PRESTO® and COVID-DUO®, compared to the gold standard, RT-PCR (real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). Methods: RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 was performed from nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in adult patients visiting the infectious disease department at the hospital (Orléans, France). Capillary whole blood (CWB) samples from the fingertip taken at different time points after onset of the disease were tested with POC tests. The specificity and sensitivity of the rapid test kits compared to test of reference (RT-PCR) were calculated. Results: Among 381 patients with symptoms of COVID-19 who went to the hospital for a diagnostic, 143 patients were RT-PCR negative. Results of test with POC tests were all negative for these patients, indicating a specificity of 100% for both POC tests. In the RT-PCR positive subgroup (n = 238), 133 patients were tested with COVID-PRESTO® and 129 patients were tested with COVID-DUO® (24 patients tested with both). The further the onset of symptoms was from the date of collection, the greater the sensitivity. The sensitivity of COVID-PRESTO® test ranged from 10.00% for patients having experienced their 1st symptoms from 0 to 5 days ago to 100% in patients where symptoms had occurred more than 15 days before the date of tests. For COVID-DUO® test, the sensitivity ranged from 35.71% [0-5 days] to 100% (> 15 days). Conclusion: COVID-PRESTO® and DUO® POC tests turned out to be very specific (none false positive) and to be sensitive enough after 15 days from onset of symptom. These easy to use IgG/IgM combined test kits are the first ones allowing a screening with CWB sample, by typing from a finger prick. These rapid tests are particularly interesting for screening in low resource settings."
8365,Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection: Microbiologic perspectives and anatomic considerations for sanctuary sites.,"Introduction: A significant chunk of global life - the economy, sports, aviation, academic, and entertainment activities - has significantly been affected by the ravaging outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) with devastating consequences on morbidity and mortality in many countries of the world. Methods: This review utilized search engines such as google scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, and web of science to retrieve articles and information using keywords like ""Coronavirus"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""Origin of coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2"", ""microbiology of coronavirus"", ""microbiology of SARS-CoV-2"", COVID-19"", ""Coronavirus reservoir sites"", ""Anatomic sanctuary sites and SARS-CoV-2"", biological barriers and coronavirus"", biological barrier and SARS-CoV-2"". Results: While this pandemic has caught the global scientific community at its lowest level of preparedness, it has inadvertently created a unified and wholesome approach towards developing potential vaccine (s) candidates by escalating clinical trial protocols in many countries of Europe, China and the United States. Interestingly, viral pathobiology continues to be an evolving aspect that potentially shows that the management of the current outbreak may largely depend on the discovery of a vaccine as the administration of known antiviral drugs are proving to offer some respite. Unfortunately, discontinuation and longtime administration of these drugs have been implicated in endocrine, reproductive and neurological disorders owing to the development of pathological lesions at anatomical sanctuary sites such as the brain and testis, as well as the presence of complex biological barriers that permit the entry of viruses but selective to the entrance of chemical substances and drugs. Conclusion: This review focuses on the microbiologic perspectives and importance of anatomical sanctuary sites in the possible viral rebound or reinfection into the system and their implications in viral re-entry and development of reproductive and neurological disorders in COVID-19 patients."
8366,Thromboembolism after COVID-19 vaccine in patients with preexisting thrombocytopenia.,"While vaccination is the single most effective intervention to drastically reduce severe disease and death following SARS-CoV-2 infection, as shown in UK and Israel, some serious concerns have been raised for an unusual adverse drug reaction (ADR), including vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) with concurrent low platelets as well as capillary leak syndrome. In fact, the overall safety of the vaccine is highlighted by the low frequency of ADR considering that in UK, by the early June, 40 million first doses and 29 million second doses have been injected; nonetheless, 390 thrombotic events, including 71 fatal events have been reported. Interestingly, the cases reported low platelet counts with the presence of anti-platelet factor-4 (PF4) antibodies, indicating an abnormal clotting reaction. Here, out of three referred cases, we report a post-vaccine clinical case of fatal thrombosis with postmortem examination and whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis, whose pathogenesis appeared associated to a preexisting condition of thrombocytopenia due to myelodysplasia."
8367,How to deal and learn from the threat of COVID-19 in paediatric dentistry.,"COVID-19, acronym of coronavirus disease 2019, is a viral infectious disease which rapidly developed as a pandemic. The aetiologic agent of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The 2019 coronavirus is different from SARS-CoV, but it has the same host receptor: human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 was first discovered in 2019 in Wuhan, China, unfortunately spreading globally, resulting in the 2019-2020 pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). This disease started in Asia and has spread worldwide with 1,330,240 cases and 73,868 deaths at the time of writing (6th April, 2020) and many more if this disease is not contained fast. The only effective prevention methods, until a vaccine for this disease will be produced, is active testing and containment measures. This is how China, South Korea and to some extent India have been able to reduce new cases and mortality. The health care workers, especially dentists are the most vulnerable groups of people when facing this virus."
8368,An Eye on COVID-19: A Meta-analysis of Positive Conjunctival Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction and SARS-CoV-2 Conjunctivitis Prevalence.,"This analysis and review demonstrate that, although emerging data indicate that the prevalence of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the ocular surface and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) conjunctivitis is rare, the ocular surface remains of interest as a potential inoculation and transmission site for SARS-CoV-2. Continued safety precautions should be taken as more data become available.COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a novel, global pandemic that has infected millions and, up to this point, caused more than two million fatalities worldwide. The ocular surface has become of interest as a possible vector for transmission by acting as a direct inoculation site, being a conduit for the virus into the respiratory system or as a method of transmission from potentially infected conjunctiva or tears. The components necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to theoretically infect ocular tissues are present: binding receptors (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and cluster of differentiation 147) and mechanisms for cell entry (transmembrane protease serine 2 and cathepsin L). This meta-analysis of COVID-19 prevalence data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been infrequently found in conjunctival samples when tested with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. This review estimates the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface and prevalence of conjunctivitis in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. There is much to be learned regarding ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2."
8369,Applicability of MuLBSTA scoring system as diagnostic and prognostic role in early warning of severe COVID-19.,"To explore the applicability of MuLBSTA Score in COVID-19 patients, a retrospective analysis was performed on 330 cases of COVID-19 patients in Southeast Hospital of Xiaogan City, Hubei Province. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients were described and multilobe infiltrate in CT, bacterial infection, lymphocyte count, smoke in history, history of hypertension, and age distribution in the population of mild and severe patients were analyzed. All included patients were scored according to the MuLBSTA early warning scoring system and its efficacy in early warning of severe symptoms was analyzed. CT feature of infiltration changes on multiple lobes, the absolute value of lymphocyte count of less than 0.8 × 109, accompanied by bacterial infection, history of smoking, history of hypertension, and an age of greater than 60 years old were all statistically significant factors in patients with severe COVID-19. ROC curve analysis indicated that the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the early warning system were 0.651, 0.954 and 0.93, respectively. The MuLBSTA Score has a good early warning effect on severe COVID-19 patients."
