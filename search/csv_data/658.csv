6570,"Comparison of neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, platelet lymphocyte ratio, and mean platelet volume and PCR test in COVID-19 patients.","Objective: The polymerase chain reaction test, used in the diagnosis of COVID-19, can be positive with delay, and thorax tomography is used for the diagnosis of the disease. We aimed to compare the relation between thorax tomography findings, PCR test results, and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; platelet lymphocyte ratio and mean platelet volume neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; platelet lymphocyte ratio and mean platelet volume in COVID-19 patients. Methods: COVID-19 patients were divided into three groups, according to baseline laboratory and thorax tomography findings: Group A: thorax tomography finding positive - polymerase chain reaction test positive; Group B: thorax tomography finding negative - polymerase chain reaction test positive; and Group C: thorax tomography finding positive - polymerase chain reaction test negative. Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, platelet lymphocyte ratio, and mean platelet volume values were compared between these three groups. Results: Group C neutrophil lymphocyte ratio level and polymerase chain reaction level were statistically higher than that of group B (p<0.001 in both). Mean platelet volume was not statistically significant between groups (p>0.005 for all). A positive correlation was detected between neutrophil lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein (r=0.421, p<0.001). Similarly, positive correlation was found with polymerase chain reaction and C-reactive protein (r=0.243, p=0.001). Conclusions: The thorax tomography finding can be detected earlier in the disease before the polymerase chain reaction test. The sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction test varies according to the tester, the way of performing it, and the quality of the test. Therefore, especially in patients with polymerase chain reaction negative and thorax tomography findings, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio and platelet lymphocyte ratio levels should be evaluated, and patients should be followed up upon suspicion of COVID-19 diagnosis."
6571,Acute relapse and poor immunization following COVID-19 vaccination in a rituximab-treated multiple sclerosis patient.,"With the progress of COVID-19 vaccination programs worldwide, some new adverse events associated with the available vaccines may unfold, especially in subpopulations, representatives of whom were not included in phase I, II, and III clinical trials of these vaccines, such as patients with autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). A 34-year-old woman presented with severe right hemiplegia and ataxia. She was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) 13 years ago and treated with rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) during the last 15 months. She had received her first dose of adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) three months after her last infusion of rituximab and three days before experiencing her latest MS relapse episode, preceded by mild symptoms (fatigue, myalgia, generalized weakness, etc.). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed several new periventricular, juxtacortical, brainstem, and cerebellar peduncle lesions. She received corticosteroid therapy for five consecutive days, and her neurological deficits slightly improved. Twenty-one days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, her anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were below the lower detection limit. However, a decision was made to adhere to the vaccination schedule and not risk the patient's safety against an unfortunate COVID-19 contraction, and thus, she was advised to receive the second Gam-COVID-Vac dose after discontinuation of oral steroid taper. The safety of adenovirus-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune diseases requires further investigation. Meanwhile, clinicians should raise awareness among their patients regarding the potentially limited efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in those treated with anti-CD20 treatments. After careful, individualized risk-benefit assessments, planning a delay/pause in such treatments to create a time window for patients to receive the vaccine and develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity may be recommended."
6572,Vascular Surgery During COVID-19 Emergency in Hub Hospitals of Lombardy: Experience on 305 Patients.,"Objective: During the most aggressive phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, the Regional Authority of Lombardy identified a number of hospitals, named Hubs, chosen to serve the whole region for highly specialised cases, including vascular surgery. This study reports the experience of the four Hubs for Vascular Surgery in Lombardy and provides a comparison of in hospital mortality and major adverse events (MAEs) according to COVID-19 testing. Methods: Data from all patients who were referred to the Vascular Surgery Department of Hubs from 9 March to 28 April 2020 were collected prospectively and analysed. A positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction swab test, or symptoms (fever > 37.5 °C, upper respiratory tract symptoms, chest pain, and contact/travel history) associated with interstitial pneumonia on chest computed tomography scan were considered diagnostic of COVID-19 disease. Patient characteristics, operative variables, and in hospital outcomes were compared according to COVID-19 testing. A multivariable model was used to identify independent predictors of in hospital death and MAEs. Results: Among 305 included patients, 64 (21%) tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID group) and 241 (79%) did not (non-COVID group). COVID patients presented more frequently with acute limb ischaemia than non-COVID patients (64% vs. 23%; p < .001) and had a significantly higher in hospital mortality (25% vs. 6%; p < .001). Clinical success, MAEs, re-interventions, and pulmonary and renal complications were significantly worse in COVID patients. Independent risk factors for in hospital death were COVID (OR 4.1), medical treatment (OR 7.2), and emergency setting (OR 13.6). COVID (OR 3.4), obesity class V (OR 13.5), and emergency setting (OR 4.0) were independent risk factors for development of MAEs. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardy, acute limb ischaemia was the most frequent vascular disease requiring surgical treatment. COVID-19 was associated with a fourfold increased risk of death and a threefold increased risk of major adverse events."
6573,An overview of COVID-19.,"Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. By Feb. 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that typically include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, often with pulmonary involvement. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and most individuals within the population at large are susceptible to infection. Wild animal hosts and infected patients are currently the main sources of disease which is transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact. Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic. Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development. This review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert consensus. We will also share ongoing efforts and experience in China, which may provide insight on how to contain the epidemic and improve our understanding of this emerging infectious disease, together with updated guidance for prevention, control, and critical management of this pandemic."
6574,SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-N1C1: A yeast-expressed SARS-CoV-2 recombinant receptor-binding domain candidate vaccine stimulates virus neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immunity in mice.,"There is an urgent need for an accessible and low-cost COVID-19 vaccine suitable for low- and middle-income countries. Here, we report on the development of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, expressed at high levels in yeast (Pichia pastoris), as a suitable vaccine candidate against COVID-19. After introducing two modifications into the wild-type RBD gene to reduce yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and improve stability during protein expression, we show that the recombinant protein, RBD219-N1C1, is equivalent to the wild-type RBD recombinant protein (RBD219-WT) in an in vitro ACE-2 binding assay. Immunogenicity studies of RBD219-N1C1 and RBD219-WT proteins formulated with Alhydrogel® were conducted in mice, and, after two doses, both the RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 vaccines induced high levels of binding IgG antibodies. Using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we further showed that sera obtained after a two-dose immunization schedule of the vaccines were sufficient to elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers in the 1:1,000 to 1:10,000 range, for both antigens tested. The vaccines induced IFN-γ IL-6, and IL-10 secretion, among other cytokines. Overall, these data suggest that the RBD219-N1C1 recombinant protein, produced in yeast, is suitable for further evaluation as a human COVID-19 vaccine, in particular, in an Alhydrogel® containing formulation and possibly in combination with other immunostimulants."
6575,Focused role of nanoparticles against COVID-19: Diagnosis and treatment.,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) has witnessed a rapid and global proliferation since its early identification in patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China. As of 27th May 2020, 2019-nCoV cases have risen to >5 million, with confirmed deaths of 350,000. However, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnostic and treatment measures are yet to be fully unraveled, given the novelty of this particular coronavirus. Therefore, existing antiviral agents used for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were repurposed for COVID-19, taking their biological features into consideration. This study provides a concise review of the current and emerging detection and supervision technologies for SARS-CoV-2, which is the viral etiology of COVID19, and their performance characteristics, with emphasis on the novel Nano-based diagnostic tests (protein corona sensor array and magnetic levitation) and treatment measures (treatment protocols based on nano-silver colloids) for COVID-19."

6577,Hypotheses behind the very rare cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.,"As of 4 April 2021, a total of 169 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and 53 cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis were reported to EudraVigilance among around 34 million people vaccinated in the European Economic Area and United Kingdom with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, a chimpanzee adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1) encoding the spike protein antigen of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The first report of the European Medicines Agency gathering data on 20 million people vaccinated with Vaxzevria® in the UK and the EEA concluded that the number of post-vaccination cases with thromboembolic events as a whole reported to EudraVigilance in relation to the number of people vaccinated was lower than the estimated rate of such events in the general population. However, the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee concluded that unusual thromboses with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of Vaxzevria®, pointing to a possible link. The same issue was identified with the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S). Currently, there is still a sharp contrast between the clinical or experimental data reported in the literature on COVID-19 and the scarcity of data on the unusual thrombotic events observed after the vaccination with these vaccines. Different hypotheses might support these observations and should trigger further in vitro and ex vivo investigations. Specialized studies were needed to fully understand the potential relationship between vaccination and possible risk factors in order to implement risk minimization strategies."
6578,Changes in breast cancer management during the Corona Virus Disease 19 pandemic: An international survey of the European Breast Cancer Research Association of Surgical Trialists (EUBREAST).,"Background: Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) had a worldwide negative impact on healthcare systems, which were not used to coping with such pandemic. Adaptation strategies prioritizing COVID-19 patients included triage of patients and reduction or re-allocation of other services. The aim of our survey was to provide a real time international snapshot of modifications of breast cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A survey was developed by a multidisciplinary group on behalf of European Breast Cancer Research Association of Surgical Trialists and distributed via breast cancer societies. One reply per breast unit was requested. Results: In ten days, 377 breast centres from 41 countries completed the questionnaire. RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 prior to treatment was reported by 44.8% of the institutions. The estimated time interval between diagnosis and treatment initiation increased for about 20% of institutions. Indications for primary systemic therapy were modified in 56% (211/377), with upfront surgery increasing from 39.8% to 50.7% (p < 0.002) and from 33.7% to 42.2% (p < 0.016) in T1cN0 triple-negative and ER-negative/HER2-positive cases, respectively. Sixty-seven percent considered that chemotherapy increases risks for developing COVID-19 complications. Fifty-one percent of the responders reported modifications in chemotherapy protocols. Gene-expression profile used to evaluate the need for adjuvant chemotherapy increased in 18.8%. In luminal-A tumours, a large majority (68%) recommended endocrine treatment to postpone surgery. Postoperative radiation therapy was postponed in 20% of the cases. Conclusions: Breast cancer management was considerably modified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data provide a base to investigate whether these changes impact oncologic outcomes."
6579,"Emergency physician stressors, concerns, and behavioral changes during COVID-19: A longitudinal study.","Objectives: The objective was to provide a longitudinal assessment of anxiety levels and work and home concerns of U.S. emergency physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We performed a longitudinal, cross-sectional email survey of clinically active emergency physicians (attending, fellow, and resident) at seven academic emergency departments. Follow-up surveys were sent 4 to 6 weeks after the initial survey and assessed the following: COVID-19 patient exposure, availability of COVID-19 testing, levels of home and workplace anxiety/stress, changes in behaviors, and performance on a primary care posttraumatic stress disorder screen (PC-PTSD-5). Logistic regression explored factors associated with a high PC-PTSD-5 scale score (≥3), indicating increased risk for PTSD. Results: Of the 426 surveyed initial respondents, 262 (61.5%) completed the follow-up survey. While 97.3% (255/262) reported treating suspected COVID-19 patients, most physicians (162/262, 61.8%) had not received testing themselves. In follow-up, respondents were most concerned about the relaxing of social distancing leading to a second wave (median score = 6, IQR = 4-7). Physicians reported a consistently high ability to order COVID-19 tests for patients (median score = 6, IQR = 5-7) and access to personal protective equipment (median score = 6, IQR = 5-6). Women physicians were more likely to score ≥ 3 than men on the PC-PTSD-5 screener on the initial survey (43.3% vs. 22.5%; Δ 20.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.3% to 31.5%), and despite decreases in overall proportions, this discrepancy remained in follow-up (34.7% vs. 16.8%; Δ 17.9%, 95% CI = 7.1% to 28.1%). In examining the relationship between demographics, living situations, and institution location on having a PC-PTSD-5 score ≥ 3, only female sex was associated with a PC-PTSD-5 score ≥ 3 (adjusted odds ratio = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.28 to 4.79). Conclusions: While exposure to suspected COVID-19 patients was nearly universal, stress levels in emergency physicians decreased with time. At both initial and follow-up assessments, women were more likely to test positive on the PC-PTSD-5 screener compared to men."
