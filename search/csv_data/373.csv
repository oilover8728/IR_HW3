3721,A depthwise separable dense convolutional network with convolution block attention module for COVID-19 diagnosis on CT scans.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 3 million deaths and infected more than 170 million individuals all over the world. Rapid identification of patients with COVID-19 is the key to control transmission and prevent depletion of hospitals. Several networks have been proposed to assist radiologists in diagnosing COVID-19 based on CT scans. However, CTs used in these studies are unavailable for other researchers to do deeper extensions due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, these networks are too heavy-weighted to satisfy the general trend applying on a computationally limited platform. In this paper, we aim to solve these two problems. Firstly, we establish an available dataset COVID-CTx, which contains 828 CT scans positive for COVID-19 across 324 patient cases from three open access data repositories. To our knowledge, it has the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases compared to other public datasets. Secondly, we propose a light-weighted hybrid neural network: Depthwise Separable Dense Convolutional Network with Convolution Block Attention Module (AM-SdenseNet). AM-SdenseNet synergistically integrates Convolutional Block Attention Module with depthwise separable convolutions to learn powerful feature representations while reducing the parameters to overcome the overfitting problem. Through experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed AM-SdenseNet compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. The excellent performance of AM-SdenseNet can improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis, which is extremely useful to control the spreading of infection."

No effective treatment or vaccine has been approved yet for this pandemic disease. Cutting-edge tools, especially nanotechnology, should be strongly considered to tackle this virus. This review aims to propose several strategies to design and fabricate effective diagnostic and therapeutic agents against COVID-19 by the aid of nanotechnology. Polymeric, inorganic self-assembling materials and peptide-based nanoparticles are promising tools for battling COVID-19 as well as its rapid diagnosis. This review summarizes all of the exciting advances nanomaterials are making toward COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis and therapy."

3725,Proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests and vaccination in Veterans Affairs Community Living Centers.,"Background/objectives: COVID-19 has caused significant morbidity and mortality in nursing homes. Vaccination against SARS-COV-2 holds promise for reduction in COVID-19. This operational analysis describes the proportion of SARS-COV-2 positive tests before, during, and after vaccination. Design: Retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis from October 1, 2020 until February 14, 2021. Setting: A total of 130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Centers (CLC), analogous to nursing homes. Intervention: Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Measurements: The primary measure is the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among CLC residents. In a pooled analysis of weekly testing and vaccine data, the proportion of positive tests was compared for the unvaccinated, first dose, and second dose. For each CLC, we identified the week in which 50% of CLC residents were vaccinated (index week). The analysis aligned the index week for CLCs and examined the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests at the CLC level before and after. As a reference, we plotted the proportion of positive tests in nursing homes in the same county as the CLC using publicly reported data. Results: Within the pooled VA CLCs, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was delivered to 50% of CLC residents within 1 week of availability and second dose within 5 weeks. Relative to the index week, the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in the vaccinated relative to unvaccinated was significantly lower in Week 4 (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.68). Throughout the study period, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in community nursing homes was higher compared to VA CLC and also declined after vaccine availability. Conclusion: The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests significantly declined in VA CLCs 4 weeks after vaccine delivery and continued to decline in vaccinated and unvaccinated residents. The results describe the importance of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and vaccination in VA nursing home residents."

3727,Is it enough for COVID-19 screening test? Limitation of swab test and general characteristics of mild symptom patients.,"The most common method for SARS-CoV-2 testing is throat or nasal swabbing by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. In South Korea, drive-through swab test is used for screening system and community treatment centers (CTCs), which admit and treat confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms, are being used. This retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to a CTC on March 6, 2020. A total of 313 patients were admitted. The nasal and throat swabs were collected from the upper respiratory tract, and a sputum test was performed to obtain lower respiratory samples. The positive rate of the first set of test, sputum test was higher than that of the swab test (p = 0.011). In the second set of test, 1 week after the first ones, the rate of positive swab tests was relatively high (p = 0.026). In the first set of test, 66 of 152 (43.4%) patients showed 24-h consecutive negative swab test results, when the sputum test results were considered together, that number fell to 29 patients (19.1%) (p < 0.001). Also, in the second set of test, 63 of 164 (38.4%) patients met the discharge criteria only when the swab test was considered; that number fell to 30 (18.3%) when the sputum test results were also considered (p < 0.001). Using the swab test alone is insufficient for screening test and discharge decision. Patients who may have positive result in the sputum test can be missed."

3729,The serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia is similar to that in the general population.,"Background: Patients with hematological malignancies are at an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) and adverse outcome. However, a low mortality rate has been reported in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Preclinical evidence suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may have a protective role against severe COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 564 consecutive patients with CML who were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies at their first outpatient visit between May and early November 2020 in five hematologic centers representative of three Italian regions. Results: The estimated serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with CML after the first pandemic wave was similar to that in the general population (about 2%), both at national and regional levels. CML patients with positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology were more frequently male (p = 0.027) and active workers (p = 0.012), while there was no significant association with TKI treatment type. Only 3 out of 11 IgG-positive patients had previously received a molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, while the remainders were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Conclusions: Our data confirm that the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with CML is generally mild and reassure about the safety of continuing TKIs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we suggest that patients with CML succeed to mount an antibody response after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the general population."
