770,A new SYBR Green real-time PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2.,"Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the etiologic agent of the 2020 pandemic outbreak is a betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. For public health interventions, a diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity is required. The gold standard protocol for diagnosis by the Word Health Organization (WHO) is RT-PCR. To detect low viral loads and perform large-scale screening, a low-cost diagnostic test is necessary. Here, we developed a cost-effective test capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2. We validated an auxiliary protocol for molecular diagnosis with the SYBR Green RT-PCR methodology to successfully screen negative cases of SARS-CoV-2. Our results revealed a set of primers with high specificity and no homology with other viruses from the Coronovideae family or human respiratory tract pathogenic viruses, presenting with complementarity only for rhinoviruses/enteroviruses and Legionella spp. Optimization of the annealing temperature and polymerization time led to a high specificity in the PCR products. We have developed a more affordable and swift methodology for negative SARS-CoV-2 screening. This methodology can be applied on a large scale to soften panic and economic burden through guidance for isolation strategies."
771,"Had COVID-19 spread in the community before the first confirmed case in Nagasaki, Japan?","This retrospective study evaluated stored nasopharyngeal swab samples from Japanese patients with influenza-like illness during the 2019/2020 season. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 had spread in the community before the first confirmed case. The period of influenza season during 2019/2020 in Nagasaki was shorter than in previous influenza seasons. When the first COVID-19 case was reported in Nagasaki prefecture, the number of influenza cases were very low. No positive results for SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 182 samples that were obtained from adult outpatients. Our results revealed no large-scale spread of COVID-19 in the community before the first confirmed case."
772,First Identified Cases of SARS-CoV-2 Variant B.1.1.7 in Minnesota - December 2020-January 2021.,"On January 9, 2021, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) announced the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7, also referred to as 20I/501Y.V1 and VOC 202012/01, in specimens from five persons; on January 25, MDH announced the identification of this variant in specimens from three additional persons. The B.1.1.7 variant, which is reported to be more transmissible than certain other SARS-CoV-2 lineages*,â€  (1), was first reported in the United Kingdom in December 2020 (1). As of February 14, 2021, a total of 1,173 COVID-19 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant had been identified in 39 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (2). Modeling data suggest that B.1.1.7 could become the predominant variant in the United States in March 2021 (3)."

774,A Case Series of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-Positive Hospitalized Infants 60 Days of Age or Younger From 2 New York City Pediatric Emergency Departments.,"The emergence of novel coronavirus disease-2019 poses an unprecedented challenge to pediatricians. While the majority of children experience mild disease, initial case reports on young infants are conflicting. We present a case series of 8 hospitalized infants 60 days of age or younger with coronavirus disease-2019. A quarter of these patients had coinfections (viral or bacterial). None of these infants had severe disease. Continued vigilance in testing this vulnerable group of infants is warranted."
775,"Progression of SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in St. Louis, Missouri, through January 2021.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity was assessed for 3,066 individuals visiting hospitals in St. Louis, Missouri, during July 2020, November 2020, or January 2021. Seropositivity in children increased from 5.22% in July to 21.16% in January. In the same time frame, seropositivity among adults increased from 4.52% to 19.03%, prior to initiation of mass vaccination. IMPORTANCE This study determined the percentage of children and adult samples from the St. Louis metropolitan area in Missouri with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during three collection periods spanning July 2020 to January 2021. By January 2021, 20.68% of the tested individuals had antibodies. These results show the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in St. Louis, Missouri, and provide a snapshot of the extent of infection just prior to the start of mass vaccination."

778,Sensitive Detection of SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibodies in Dried Blood Spot Samples.,"Dried blood spot (DBS) samples can be used for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike antibodies. DBS sampling is comparable to matched serum samples with a relative 98.1% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Thus, DBS sampling offers an alternative for population-wide serologic testing in the coronavirus pandemic."
779,Applications of the CRISPR-Cas system for infectious disease diagnostics.,"Introduction: Rapid and accurate diagnostic approaches are essential for impeding the spread of infectious diseases. This review aims to summarize current progress of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems in the applications for diagnostics of infectious diseases including the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss class 2 CRISPR-Cas biosensing systems-based diagnostics in various emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, CRISPR-Cas systems have created a new era for early diagnostics of infectious diseases, especially with the discovery of the collateral cleavage activity of Cas12 and Cas13. We mainly focus on different CRISPR-Cas effectors for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms as well as provide a detailed explanation of the pros and cons of CRISPR-Cas biosensing systems. In addition, we also introduce future research perspectives. Expert commentary: However, further improvement of newly discovered systems and engineering existing ones should be developed to increase the specificity, sensitivity or stability of the diagnostic tools. It may be a long journey to finish the clinical transition from research use. CRISPR-Cas approaches will emerge as more promising and robust tools for infectious disease diagnosis in the future."
