9430,"COVID-19 in normal, diseased and transplanted liver.","Starting from December 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has extended in the entire world giving origin to a pandemic. Although the respiratory system is the main apparatus involved by the infection, several other organs may suffer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related injuries. The human tissues expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are all possible targets of viral damage. In fact myocarditis, meningo-encephalitis, acute kidney injury and other complications have been described with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The liver has a central role in the body homeostasis contributing to detoxification, catabolism and also synthesis of important factor such as plasma proteins. ACE2 is significantly expressed just by cholangiocytes within the liver, however transaminases are increased in more than one third of COVID-19 patients, at hospital admission. The reasons for liver impairment in the course of this infection are not completely clear at present and multiple factors such as: Direct viral effect, release of cytokines, ischemic damage, use of hepatotoxic drugs, sepsis, and others, may contribute to damage. While COVID-19 seems to elicit just a transient alteration of liver function tests in subjects with normal hepatic function, of concern, more severe sequelae are frequently observed in patients with a reduced hepatic reserve. In this review we report data regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in subjects with normal or diseased liver. In addition the risks of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients (either transplanted or suffering for autoimmune liver diseases) are also described."

9432,Dysregulated liver function in SARS-CoV-2 infection: Current understanding and perspectives.,"Since it was first reported in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has spread rapidly around the world to cause the ongoing pandemic. Although the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly in the respiratory system, liver enzyme abnormalities exist in around half of the cases, which indicate liver injury, and raise clinical concern. At present, there is no consensus whether the liver injury is directly caused by viral replication in the liver tissue or indirectly by the systemic inflammatory response. This review aims to summarize the clinical manifestations and to explore the underlying mechanisms of liver dysfunction in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection."
9433,Quantifying the effect of trypsin and elastase on in vitro SARS-CoV infections.,"The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has the potential to cause serious disease that can spread rapidly around the world. Much of our understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis comes from in vitro experiments. Unfortunately, in vitro experiments cannot replicate all the complexity of the in vivo infection. For example, proteases in the respiratory tract cleave the SARS-CoV surface protein to facilitate viral entry, but these proteases are not present in vitro. Unfortunately, proteases might also have an effect on other parts of the replication cycle. Here, we use mathematical modeling to estimate parameters characterizing viral replication for SARS-CoV in the presence of trypsin or elastase, and in the absence of either. In addition to increasing the infection rate, the addition of trypsin and elastase causes lengthening of the eclipse phase duration and the infectious cell lifespan."

9435,[Clinical features of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection: an analysis of 115 cases].,"Objective: To study the clinical features of children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 115 children who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Wuhan Children's Hospital, including general information, history of close contact with individuals of SARS-CoV-2 infection, early clinical symptoms, laboratory examination results, and lung CT results. Results: Among the 115 children, there were 73 boys (63.5%) and 42 girls (36.5%), with a male/female ratio of 1:0.58. Of the 115 children, 105 (91.3%) had a definite history of close contact with individuals of SARS-CoV-2-infection. An increase in alanine aminotransferase was observed in 11 children (9.6%) and an increase in CK-MB was found in 34 children (29.6%). As for clinical symptoms, 29 children (25.2%) had fever, 47 (40.9%) had respiratory symptoms (including cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion), and 61 (53.0%) were asymptomatic. Lung CT findings showed ground glass opacity, fiber opacities, patchy changes, and pulmonary consolidation in 49 children (42.6%), among whom 2 children had ""white lung""; 39 children (33.9%) only had lung texture enhancement and 27 children (23.5%) had no pulmonary imaging changes. Among the 115 children, 3 were critically ill, among whom 1 had been cured and the other 2 were under continuous treatment. Conclusions: Most of the children with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a close contact history. Critical cases are rare and there is a high proportion of asymptomatic infection."
9436,SARS-CoV: Lessons learned; opportunities missed for SARS-CoV-2.,"SARS-CoV-2 and Covid-19 have made a retrospective analysis of other coronavirus diseases important, so this article reviews the history of the SARS-CoV viral disease from 2003. Standard and clinical chemistry diagnostics were developed in response to the outbreak. The response to SARS is examined to determine if there were lessons learned before it disappeared in June and July 2003. Various diagnostic approaches were developed and implemented to assist in the rapid identification of patients and treatment of their illness, yet many of the approaches required days or weeks from the onset of fever to show statistical significance. Most of the therapeutic methods used during the outbreak relied on treating symptoms of the underlying illness, such as lower respiratory infections and systemic infection, rather than effectively suppressing or curtailing replication of the virus. Retrospective studies are examined to determine how the SARS outbreak was viewed 10 years on and what the authors hoped would be instructive patterns for possible future pandemics. Implementation of some of these recommendations might have helped ease the current pandemic but were overlooked for budgetary reasons that seem short-sighted at present."

9438,Preventing the suspension of dental clinics by minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during dental treatment.,"Due to a high risk of the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) during dental work, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) pandemic has had a considerable influence on the functioning of dental clinics. The elevated risk of transmission is related to the production of aerosol containing secretions from the upper respiratory tract that is produced during dental procedures.The purpose of this narrative review was to present the current knowledge concerning COVID‑19 and to propose methods for reducing the spread of the virus. Dental staff should follow the current guidelines and ensure safety at work through the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including FFP2/FFP3 filter masks, the implementation of the screening protocols and telephone consultations as well as the appropriate preparation of dental practices and patient waiting areas. In addition, it is essential to reduce the number of people simultaneously occupying one building by effectively planning visiting times or discouraging patients from accompanied visits. Procedures that may contribute to production of the aerosol should also be limited."
9439,Vaccination against seasonal influenza and socio-economic and environmental factors as determinants of the geographic variation of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the Italian elderly.,"Background: A possible protective effect of seasonal influenza vaccination against the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been suggested. Methods: We used publicly available data bases to explore the hypothesis as well as the effect of multiple social and environmental factors in the 20 Italian regions. Results: Our results suggest that vaccination against seasonal influenza might beneficially impact on incidence and severity of the novel corona virus epidemic. Population density and vehicular traffic were also moderately associated with cumulative incidence of COVID-19. None of the other variables we considered showed an effect on cumulative incidence, case fatality rate or mortality from COVID-19. Conclusions: Extending influenza vaccination coverage particularly among the elderly, vulnerable individuals with specific chronic medical conditions, health care workers, and workers in other essential services, early in the upcoming 2020 influenza season, might help reduce the health impact of a second epidemic wave of COVID-19."
