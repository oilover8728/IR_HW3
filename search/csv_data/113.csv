1120,SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and implications for vaccine development.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern. Multiple vaccine candidates for COVID-19, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have entered clinical trials. However, some evidence suggests that patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can be reinfected. For example, in China, two discharged COVID-19 patients who had recovered and fulfilled the discharge criteria for COVID-19 were retested positive to a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the virus. This finding is critical and could hamper COVID-19 vaccine development. This review offers literature-based evidence of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, provides explanation for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection both from the agent and host points of view, and discusses its implication for COVID-19 vaccine development."
1121,"The novel coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19): Mechanism of action, detection and recent therapeutic strategies.","Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, designated as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the February 11, 2020, is one of the highly pathogenic β-coronaviruses which infects human. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is the most critical step to treat infection. The diagnostic tools are generally molecular methods, serology and viral culture. Recently CRISPR-based method has been investigated to diagnose and treat coronavirus infection. The emergence of 2019-nCoV during the influenza season, has led to the extensive use of antibiotics and neuraminidase enzyme inhibitors, taken orally and intravenously. Currently, antiviral inhibitors of SARS and MERS spike proteins, neuraminidase inhibitors, anti-inflammatory drugs and EK1 peptide are the available therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. In addition, Chloroquine, which was previously used for malarial and autoimmune disease, has shown efficacy in the 2019-nCoV infection treatment. In severe hypoxaemia, a combination of antibiotics, α-interferon, lopinavir and mechanical ventilation can effectively mitigate the symptoms. Comprehensive knowledge on the innate and adaptive immune responses, will make it possible to propose potent antiviral drugs with their effective therapeutic measures for the prevention of viral infection. This therapeutic strategy will help patients worldwide to protect themselves against severe and fatal viral infections, that potentially can evolve and develop drug resistance, and to reduce mortality rates."
1122,"Potential effects of vaccinations on the prevention of COVID-19: rationale, clinical evidence, risks, and public health considerations.","Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly spread around the world. Areas covered This review will discuss the available immunologic and clinical evidence to support the benefit of the influenza, pneumococcal, and tuberculosis vaccines in the context of COVID-19 as well as to provide an overview on the COVID-19-specific vaccines that are in the development pipeline. In addition, implications for vaccination strategies from a public health perspective will be discussed. Expert opinion Some vaccines are being considered for their potentially beneficial role in preventing or improving the prognosis of COVID-19: influenza, pneumococcal and tuberculosis vaccines. These vaccines may have either direct effect on COVID-19 via different types of immune responses or indirect effects by reducing the burden of viral and bacterial respiratory diseases on individual patients and national healthcare system and by facilitating differential diagnoses with other viral/bacterial respiratory disease. On the other hand, a large number of candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently in the pipeline and undergoing phase I, II, and III clinical studies. As SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are expected to be marketed through accelerated regulatory pathways, vaccinovigilance as well as planning of a successful vaccination campaign will play a major role in protecting public health."
1123,Understanding the immunological aspects of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 pandemic: A therapeutic approach.,"In December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel variant of coronavirus has emerged from Wuhan in China and has created havoc impulses across the world with a larger number of fatalities. At the same time, studies are on roll to discover potent vaccine against it or repurposing of approved drugs which are widely adopted are under trial to eradicate the SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 pandemic. Reports have also shown that there are asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 disease who can transmit the disease to others too. However, the first line defense of the viral attack is body's strong and well-coordinated immune response producing excessive inflammatory innate reaction, thus impaired adaptive host immune defense which lead to death upon the malfunctioning. Considerable works are going on to establish the relation between immune parameters and viral replication that, might alter both the innate and adaptive immune system of COVID-19 patient by up riding a massive cytokines and chemokines secretion. This review mainly gives an account on how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with our immune system and how does our immune system responds to it, along with that drugs which are being used or can be used in fighting COVID-19 disease. The curative therapies as treatment for it have also been addressed in the perspective of adaptive immunity of the patients."
1124,Next-generation COVID-19 vaccines: Opportunities for vaccine development and challenges in tackling COVID-19.,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global threat. Although non-pharmaceutical interventions have been rigorously and widely implemented, living conditions caused by the pandemic will last until highly effective vaccines are successfully improved and globally administered. Several first-generation COVID-19 vaccines were approved at the end of 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is persisting worldwide. To be clear, the efficiency and the coverage of current vaccines are insufficient, but newly emerging and rapidly spreading variants are the most pressing concern. A second-generation COVID-19 vaccine worth mentioning, NVX-CoV2373, has demonstrated 90% overall efficacy as well as a high level of efficacy against circulating variants in Phase 3 clinical trials. Currently, NVX-CoV2373 is the only vaccine that has proven successful against variants during Phase 3/4 trials. Therefore, developing the next generation of vaccines is a promising strategy to ultimately prevail against SARS-CoV-2. This review provides up-to-date information on COVID-19 vaccines in terms of their efficacy and new platforms and the progression of COVID-19 vaccination. Moreover, this review also summarizes the efficacy of approved COVID-19 vaccines against variants. Lastly, this review highlights the global challenges for COVID-19 vaccines in development and vaccination, and it discusses opportunities for development of future COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination coverage."
1125,Comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid antigen test to the real star Sars-CoV-2 RT PCR kit.,"There is an ongoing need for reliable antigen assays for timely and easy detection of individuals with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using 75 swabs from patients previously tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 PCR and 75 swabs from patients previously tested negative by SARS-CoV-2 PCR, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche). We determined a specificity of 96 %. The assay's sensitivity with samples with a cycle threshold of < 25, 25 - <30, 30 - <35, and> = 35 was 100 %, 95 %, 44.8 % and 22.2 %, respectively. We conclude that sensitivity and specificity of the antigen assay is inferior to the PCR assay. However, the antigen assay may be a quick and easy to perform alternative for differentiation of individuals contagious for SARS-CoV-2 from non-contagious individuals."
1126,COVID-19 vaccines: what do we know so far?,"When the novel coronavirus was described in late 2019, it could not have been imagined that within a year, more than 100 vaccine candidates would be in preclinical development and several would be in clinical trials and even approved for use. The scale of the COVID-19 outbreak pushed the scientific community, working in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, public health bodies, policymakers, funders and governments, to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at record-breaking speed. As well as driving major amendments to the usual timeframe for bringing a vaccine to fruition, the pandemic has accelerated the development of next-generation technologies for vaccinology, giving rise to two frontrunner RNA vaccines. Although none of the critical safety and efficacy steps have been skipped within the compressed schedules, and the technologies underpinning the novel vaccines have been refined by scientists over many years, a significant proportion of the global population is sceptical of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines and wary of potential risks. In this interview-based article, we give an overview of how the vaccines were developed and how they work to generate a robust immune response against COVID-19, as well as addressing common questions relating to safety and efficacy."
1127,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Kidney Transplant Recipients.,
1128,"No evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA among blood donors: A multicenter study in Hubei, China.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA could be detected in the blood of infected cases. From February 9, all blood establishments in Hubei province, China, implemented nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA among blood donors to ensure blood safety. Study design and methods: Nucleic acid test screening individually (ID) or by minipool (MP) testing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inactivated culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells was quantified by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and series diluted with negative plasma to evaluate the assay's performance. Results: The limit of detection of the kit for MP testing was 62.94 and 33.14 copies/mL for N and ORF1ab region, respectively. ID testing could achieve 3.87 and 4.85 copies/mL for two regions using 1600 μL of plasma. Coefficients of variations of two different concentrations of reference samples were all less than 5% in MP testing. As of April 30, 2020, a total of 98,342 blood donations including 87,095 whole blood donations and 11,247 platelet donations were tested by ID or MP testing, and no RNAemia was found. In addition, Hubei province suffered precipitously decreased blood supply, especially in February: 86% reduction compared with the same period of 2019. Conclusion: Nucleic acid test screening of SARS-CoV-2 on blood donations is suitable in blood establishments using the commercial real-time PCR detection kit based on available instruments. The negative result indicated that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be no direct threat to blood safety but raises some serious issues for general blood supply."
1129,Young Adults' COVID-19 Testing Intentions: The Role of Health Beliefs and Anticipated Regret.,"Purpose: Young adults are at high risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and transmission due to their social behaviors. The purpose of this study was to determine their attitudes toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing, an important approach for minimizing infection and transmission. Methods: One hundred seventy eight US individuals aged 19-25 years completed an online survey measuring COVID-19 health beliefs and testing intentions. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the association of heath belief measures (perceived COVID-19 susceptibility, COVID-19 severity, barriers and benefits to testing, and social concerns) with testing intentions. Results: Most respondents (86.0%) intended to accept a COVID-19 test if recommended by a health professional. High social concern and low perceived obstacles were associated with intent to get tested. Conclusions: In this sample, most young adults intended to accept COVID-19 testing. Health beliefs predicted testing intention and point to possible intervention approaches to increase willingness to accept COVID-19 testing."
