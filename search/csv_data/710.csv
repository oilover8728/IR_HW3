7090,Intention to get vaccinations against COVID-19 in French healthcare workers during the first pandemic wave: a cross-sectional survey.,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic and identified as a priority target group for COVID-19 vaccines. We aimed to determine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate in HCWs in France. Methods: We conducted an anonymous survey from 26th March to 2nd July 2020. The primary endpoint was the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available. Results: Two-thousand and forty-seven HCWs answered the survey; women accounted for 74% of respondents. Among respondents, 1.554 (76.9%, 95% confidence interval 75.1-78.9) would accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Older age, male gender, fear about COVID-19, individual perceived risk and flu vaccination during previous season were associated with hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Nurses and assistant nurses were less prone to accept vaccination against COVID-19 than physicians. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Flu vaccine rate was 57.3% during the previous season, and 54.6% of the respondents had the intention to get a flu vaccine during the next season. Conclusions: Intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 reached 75% in HCWs with discrepancies between occupational categories. COVID-19 pandemic had no positive effect on flu vaccine acceptance rate."
7091,Histamine receptors and COVID-19.,"Objective: Reports that the over-the-counter histamine H2 receptor antagonist famotidine could help treat the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) appeared from April 2020. We, therefore, examined reports on interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and histamine receptor antagonists. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed by 19 September 2020, and updated on 28 October 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar using (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (histamine antagonist OR famotidine OR cimetidine). ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for COVID-19 and (famotidine or histamine). Results: Famotidine may be a useful addition in COVID-19 treatment, but the results from prospective randomized trials are as yet awaited. Bioinformatics/drug repurposing studies indicated that, among several medicines, H1 and H2 receptor antagonists may interact with key viral enzymes. However, in vitro studies have to date failed to show a direct inhibition of famotidine on SARS-CoV-2 replication. Conclusions: Clinical research into the potential benefits of H2 receptor antagonists in managing COVID-19 inflammation began from a simple observation and now is being tested in multi-centre clinical trials. The positive effects of famotidine may be due to H2 receptor-mediated immunomodulatory actions on mast cell histamine-cytokine cross-talk, rather than a direct action on SARS-CoV-2."

7093,The outlook for diagnostic purposes of the 2019-novel coronavirus disease.,"At the end of December 2019, a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) appeared as the third unheard of outbreak of human coronavirus infection in the 21st century. First, in Wuhan, China, the novel SARS-CoV2 was named by the World Health Organization (WHO), as 2019-nCOV (COVID-19), and spread extremely all over the world. SARS-CoV2 is transmitted to individuals by human-to-human transmission leading to severe viral pneumonia and respiratory system injury. SARS-CoV2 elicits infections from the common cold to severe conditions accompanied by lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other organ destruction. There is a possibility of virus transmission from asymptomatic cases as active carriers, in addition to symptomatic ones, which is a crucial crisis of COVID-19 that should be considered. Hence, paying more attention to the accurate and immediate diagnosis of suspected and infected cases can be a great help in preventing the rapid spread of the virus, improving the disease prognosis, and controlling the pandemic. In this review, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the different types of Clinical and Para-clinical diagnostic methods and their practical features, which can help understand better the applications and capacities of various diagnostic approaches for COVID-19 infected cases."
7094,Case report: SARS-CoV-2-induced urticaria or just a concomitance?,"The association between urticaria and different virus infections has been reported in many studies. Different virus infections have been reported to be comorbidities of spontaneous urticaria. In this paper, we report the case of a male patient with acute urticaria 7 days after he left the hospital where he was treated for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This infection may act as a causative or a facilitating factor for the initiation of acute urticaria and additional cofactors such as stress may contribute for the urticaria phenotype to be expressed. Additional facts for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) virus in future will clarify if urticarial rash is one of the COVID's multiple faces."
7095,American College of Rheumatology Guidance for COVID-19 Vaccination in Patients With Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases: Version 2.,"Objective: To provide guidance to rheumatology providers on the use of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Methods: A task force was assembled that included 9 rheumatologists/immunologists, 2 infectious disease specialists, and 2 public health physicians. After agreeing on scoping questions, an evidence report was created that summarized the published literature and publicly available data regarding COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and safety, as well as literature for other vaccines in RMD patients. Task force members rated their agreement with draft consensus statements on a 9-point numerical scoring system, using a modified Delphi process and the RAND/University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method, with refinement and iteration over 2 sessions. Consensus was determined based on the distribution of ratings. Results: Despite a paucity of direct evidence, 74 draft guidance statements were developed by the task force and agreed upon with consensus to provide guidance for use of the COVID-19 vaccines in RMD patients and to offer recommendations regarding the use and timing of immunomodulatory therapies around the time of vaccination. Conclusion: These guidance statements, made in the context of limited clinical data, are intended to provide direction to rheumatology health care providers on how to best use COVID-19 vaccines and to facilitate implementation of vaccination strategies for RMD patients."

7098,Convalescent Plasma Transfusion for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Adults: A Global Perspective.,"More than one year into the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare systems across the world continue to be overwhelmed with soaring daily cases. The treatment spectrum primarily includes ventilation support augmented with repurposed drugs and/or convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) from recovered COVID-19 patients. Despite vaccine variants being recently developed and administered in several countries, challenges in global supply chain logistics limit their timely availability to the wider world population, particularly in developing countries. Given the measured success of conventional CPT in treating several infections over the past decade, recent studies have reported its effectiveness in decreasing the duration and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. In this review, we conduct a literature search of published studies investigating the use of CPT to treat COVID-19 patients from January 2020 to January 2021. The literature search identified 181 records of which 39 were included in this review. A random-effects model was used to aggregate data across studies, and mortality rates of 17 vs. 32% were estimated for the CPT and control patient groups, respectively, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.49. The findings indicate that CPT shows potential in reducing the severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms. However, early intervention (preferably within 3 days), recruitment of donors, and plasma potency introduce major challenges for its scaled-up implementation. Given the low number of existing randomized clinical trials (RCTs, four with a total of 319 patients), unanticipated risks to CPT recipients are highlighted and discussed. Nevertheless, CPT remains a promising COVID-19 therapeutic option that merits internationally coordinated RCTs to achieve a scientific risk-benefit consensus."
7099,"Analysis of 2019 novel coronavirus infection and clinical characteristics of outpatients: An epidemiological study from a fever clinic in Wuhan, China.","Background: Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) pneumonia, thousands of patients with fever or cough were flocked into fever clinic of designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. To date, no data have ever been reported to reflect the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among these outpatients. Moreover, it is almost unknown to discriminate COVID-19 and nucleic acid negative patients based on clinical features in the fever clinics. Methods: The infectious status of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated among the outpatients. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics were compared between COVID-19 and nucleic acid negative patients. Results: The nucleic acid positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 in the outpatients from our fever clinic was 67·1%, while the majority of patients with COVID-19 were mild cases. The predominant initial symptom in those patients with COVID-19 was fever (78.2%), followed by cough (15.6%). Very significantly lower number of eosinophils was characterized in patients with COVID-19 as compared with that of nucleic acid negative patients. More importantly, the proportion of subjects with eosinophil counts lower than normal levels in patients with COVID-19 was much higher than that of nucleic acid negative patients. Fever combined with bilateral ground-glass opacities in computed tomography imaging and eosinophil count below the normal level are probably a valuable indicator of COVID-19 infection in those outpatients. Conclusions: Those findings may provide critical information for the regions, such as Europe and United States that are facing the same situation as Wuhan experienced, and could be valuable to prevent those nucleic acid negative patients from misdiagnosis before antibody testing."
