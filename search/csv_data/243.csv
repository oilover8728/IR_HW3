2424,[How long must be an elective surgery delayed after SARS-COV-2 diagnosis? (Multiple-center regional research)].,"Objective: To determine the optimal postponement period for elective surgery in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection. Material and methods: A multiple-center regional prospective cohort research included patients who underwent elective surgeries in November, 2020. We compared the outcomes in patients with preoperative COVID-19 and those without infection. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality rate. This parameter was stratified depending on period after COVID-19 diagnosis using logistic regression. Results: Preoperative COVID-19 was diagnosed in 32 (4.6%) out of 682 patients. Thirty-day mortality rate in patients without infection was 1.5%. Preoperative coronavirus infection increased mortality rate (odds ratio 20%, 25%, 18.1% and 8.3% for surgery within 0-2, 3-4, 5-6 and 7-8 weeks after infection, respectively). Surgeries after 7-8 weeks ensured the same result as in patients without infection (odds ratio 1.5%). After 7-8-week postponement of elective surgery, patients with COVID-19 and active symptoms had higher mortality rate compared to those without or resolved symptoms (50 vs. 13 vs 6.5%, respectively). Conclusion: If possible, elective surgery should be delayed for at least 7-8 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. In patients with active symptoms in 7-8 weeks after diagnosis of infection, further postponement of surgery is recommended."

Interestingly, the neutralization of B.1.1.7 and B.1.525 lineages was significantly higher, whereas the neutralization of B.1.351 and P.1 lineages was robust but significantly lower as compared to B.1 lineage. Following our findings, we consider that the BNT162b2 vaccine offers protection against the current prevailing variants of SARS-CoV-2."
2428,Clinical Validation of a SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR Assay Targeting the Nucleocapsid Gene.,"Background: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is important for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. Methods: We present a clinical validation of a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N1) gene. Off-board lysis on an automated nucleic acid extraction system was optimized with endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and NL63). Genomic RNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a recombinant viral protein coat were used as control materials and compared for recovery from nucleic acid extraction. Results: Nucleic acid extraction showed decreased recovery of endemic Coronavirus in vitro transcribed RNA (NL63) compared with attenuated virus (OC43). SARS-CoV-2 RNA had more reliable recovery from extraction through amplification than genomic RNA. Recovery of genomic RNA was improved by combining lysis buffer with clinical matrix before adding RNA. The RT-PCR assay demonstrated 100% in silico sensitivity and specificity. The accuracy across samples was 100% (75 of 75). Precision studies showed 100% intra-run, inter-run, and inter-technologist concordance. The limit of detection was 264 copies per milliliter (estimated 5 copies per reaction; 35.56 mean threshold cycle value). Conclusions: This SARS-CoV-2 assay demonstrates appropriate characteristics for use under an Emergency Use Authorization. Endemic coronavirus controls were useful in optimizing the extraction procedure. In the absence of live or attenuated virus, recombinant virus in a protein coat is an appropriate control specimen type for assay validation during a pandemic."
