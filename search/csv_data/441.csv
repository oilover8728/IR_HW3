4403,Rapid and accurate nucleobase detection using FnCas9 and its application in COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Rapid detection of DNA/RNA pathogenic sequences or variants through point-of-care diagnostics is valuable for accelerated clinical prognosis, as witnessed during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Traditional methods relying on qPCR or sequencing are tough to implement with limited resources, necessitating the development of accurate and robust alternative strategies. Here, we report FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that utilizes a direct Cas9 based enzymatic readout for detecting nucleobase and nucleotide sequences without trans-cleavage of reporter molecules. We also demonstrate that FELUDA is 100% accurate in detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs), including heterozygous carriers, and present a simple web-tool JATAYU to aid end-users. FELUDA is semi-quantitative, can adapt to multiple signal detection platforms, and deploy for versatile applications such as molecular diagnosis during infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Employing a lateral flow readout, FELUDA shows 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity across all ranges of viral loads in clinical samples within 1hr. In combination with RT-RPA and a smartphone application True Outcome Predicted via Strip Evaluation (TOPSE), we present a prototype for FELUDA for CoV-2 detection closer to home."
4404,Design of multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2: a in-silico study.,"The best therapeutic strategy to find an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is to explore the target structural protein. In the present study, a novel multi-epitope vaccine is designed using in silico tools that potentially trigger both CD4 and CD8 T-cell immune responses against the novel Coronavirus. The vaccine candidate was designed using B and T-cell epitopes that can act as an immunogen and elicits immune response in the host system. NCBI was used for the retrieval of surface spike glycoprotein, of novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) strains. VaxiJen server screens the most important immunogen of all the proteins and IEDB server gives the prediction and analysis of B and T cell epitopes. Final vaccine construct was designed in silico composed of 425 amino acids including the 50S ribosomal protein adjuvant and the construct was computationally validated in terms of antigenicity, allergenicity and stability on considering all critical parameters into consideration. The results subjected to the modeling and docking studies of vaccine were validated. Molecular docking study revealed the protein-protein binding interactions between the vaccine construct and TLR-3 immune receptor. The MD simulations confirmed stability of the binding pose. The immune simulation results showed significant response for immune cells. The findings of the study confirmed that the final vaccine construct of chimeric peptide could able to enhance the immune response against nCoV-19."
4405,Laboratory Findings of COVID-19 Infection are Conflicting in Different Age Groups and Pregnant Women: A Literature Review.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new type and rapidly spread viral pneumonia, is now producing an outbreak of pandemic proportions. The clinical features and laboratory results of different age groups are different due to the general susceptibility of the disease. The laboratory findings of COVID-19 in pregnant women are also conflicting. Para-clinical investigations including laboratory tests and radiologic findings play an important role in early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of COVID-19. The majority of previous reports on the COVID-19 laboratory results were based on data from the general population and limited information is available based on age difference and pregnancy status. This review aimed to describe the COVID-19 laboratory findings in neonates, children, adults, elderly and pregnant women altogether for the first time. The most attracting and reliable markers of COVID-19 in patients were: normal C-reactive protein (CRP) and very different and conflicting laboratory results regardless of clinical symptoms in neonates, normal or temporary elevated CRP, conflicting WBC count results and procalcitonin elevation in children, lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in adult patients, lymphopenia and elevated CRP and LDH in the elderly people, leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio in pregnant women."
4406,Empirical evidence to understand the human factor for effective rapid testing against SARS-CoV-2.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapid antigen point-of-care and home tests are available to laypeople. In four cross-sectional mixed-methods data collections conducted between December 2020 and March 2021 (n = 4,026), we showed that a majority of subjects were willing to test despite mistrust and ignorance regarding rapid tests' validity. Experimental evidence shows that low costs and access to events could increase testing intentions. Mandatory reporting and isolation after positive results were not identified as major barriers. Instead, assuming that testing and isolation can slow down the pandemic and the possibility to protect others were related to greater willingness to get tested. While we did not find evidence for risk compensation for past tests, experimental evidence suggests that there is a tendency to show less mask wearing and physical distancing in a group of tested individuals. A short communication intervention reduced complacent behavior. The derived recommendations could make rapid testing a successful pillar of pandemic management."
4407,COVID-19 Serology at Population Scale: SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibody Responses in Saliva.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of an ongoing pandemic that has infected over 36 million and killed over 1 million people. Informed implementation of government public health policies depends on accurate data on SARS-CoV-2 immunity at a population scale. We hypothesized that detection of SARS-CoV-2 salivary antibodies could serve as a noninvasive alternative to serological testing for monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity at a population scale. We developed a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay based on Luminex technology that comprised 12 CoV antigens, mostly derived from SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Saliva and sera collected from confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and from the pre-COVID-19 era were tested for IgG, IgA, and IgM to the antigen panel. Matched saliva and serum IgG responses (n = 28) were significantly correlated. The salivary anti-N IgG response resulted in the highest sensitivity (100%), exhibiting a positive response in 24/24 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 cases sampled at >14 days post-symptom onset (DPSO), whereas the salivary anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG response yielded 100% specificity. Temporal kinetics of IgG in saliva were consistent with those observed in blood and indicated that most individuals seroconvert at around 10 DPSO. Algorithms employing a combination of the IgG responses to N and S antigens result in high diagnostic accuracy (100%) by as early as 10 DPSO. These results support the use of saliva-based antibody testing as a noninvasive and scalable alternative to blood-based antibody testing."
4408,Coronavirus-disease-2019-induced antiphospholipid-like syndrome: a case report.,"Background: This paper describes a case of antiphospholipid syndrome-like condition caused by coronavirus disease 2019. The medical community still faces many diagnostic and therapeutic challenges vis-Ã -vis coronavirus disease 2019. Ultimately, coronavirus disease 2019 is diagnosed on the basis of laboratory and radiological findings. Considering the high rate of mortality due to coagulation abnormalities and thrombosis among coronavirus disease 2019 patients, it is important to pay attention to the differential diagnoses of coronavirus disease 2019 and other diseases following thrombotic events. Case description: The patient was a 56-year-old Iranian man who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery and mitral valve repair. During hospitalization, the patient showed an elevated level of anticardiolipin antibody (immunoglobulin G isotype), antiphospholipid antibodies, and thrombosis in the brachial artery of the left hand, based on which a differential diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome was made. However, ultimately, the coronavirus disease 2019 polymerase chain reaction test and computed tomography scan of the lungs showed that the patient had coronavirus disease 2019. Conclusion: According to the few studies performed on coronavirus disease 2019 patients, elevated levels of the isotypes of antiphospholipid antibodies in coronavirus disease 2019 patients create conditions similar to antiphospholipid syndrome, which, in the absence of reliable coronavirus disease 2019 testing, can lead to misdiagnosis and consequently delayed or improper treatment. Therefore, to provide timely and appropriate treatment, it is important to pay attention to differential diagnosis."
