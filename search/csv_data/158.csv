1571,Laboratory Tests for COVID-19: A Review of Peer-Reviewed Publications and Implications for Clinical Use.,"Diagnostic tests for the coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) are critical for prompt diagnosis, treatment and isolation to break the cycle of transmission. A positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in conjunction with clinical and epidemiologic data, is the current standard for diagnosis, but several challenges still exist. Serological assays help to understand epidemiology better and to evaluate vaccine responses but they are unreliable for diagnosis in the acute phase of illness or assuming protective immunity. Serology is gaining attention, mainly because of convalescent plasma gaining importance as treatment for clinically worsening COVID-19 patients. We provide a narrative review of peer-reviewed research studies on RT-PCR, serology and antigen immune-assays for COVID-19, briefly describe their lab methods and discuss their limitations for clinical practice."

1573,Diagnostic accuracy of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress and the Abbott ID NOW assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Rapid and accurate diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is essential to prevent the spread of the virus. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert Xpress and the ID NOW assays for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 using a systemic review and meta-analysis approach. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests for detecting viruses in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were pooled. We used commercial and laboratory-developed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions as reference standards. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. We identified 11 studies involving 1734 subjects for the Xpert Xpress assay and 10 studies involving 1778 subjects for the ID NOW assay. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert Xpress assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 0.99) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.98), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the ID NOW assay were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.86) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.00), respectively. The studies included in our analysis seemed to have low methodological quality. The Xpert Xpress assay showed excellent diagnostic accuracy for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, as the ID NOW assay showed relatively low sensitivity, this test might miss several positive samples."
1574,Self-Collected Gargle Lavage Allows Reliable Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in an Outpatient Setting.,"Current procurement of specimens for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection requires trained personnel and dedicated equipment. We compared standard nasopharyngeal swabs with self-collected gargle lavage fluid obtained from 80 mostly symptomatic outpatients. After RNA extraction, RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 was performed. Qualitative results obtained with the paired samples from individual outpatients were 100% congruent. Therefore, self-collected gargle lavage fluid can serve as a suitable specimen for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing in outpatients. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still strains health care systems worldwide. While COVID-19 testing is considered an essential pillar in combating this infectious disease, shortages in supplies and trained health care personnel often limit the procurement of patient samples, in particular in outpatient settings. Here, we compared the simple self-collection of gargle lavage fluid with the gold standard nasopharyngeal swab as a specimen for COVID-19 testing. By finding complete congruence of results obtained with paired samples of a sizeable patient cohort, our results strongly support the idea that the painless self-collection of gargle lavage fluid provides a suitable and uncomplicated sample for reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection."
1575,Coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines in pregnancy.,"As of December 1, 2020, nearly 64 million people have been infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 worldwide with nearly 1.5 million global deaths. The impact of this virus has continued to overwhelm hospital infrastructure and demanded remodeling of healthcare systems. With rising concerns for a third, and possibly the largest, wave of individuals infected with the virus, national leaders are continuing to seek avenues by which we can further limit disease transmission and prevent infection with the use of vaccination. To our knowledge, no clinical trial evaluating vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 has included pregnant women. In December 2020, it was anticipated that the Food and Drug Administration will approve at least 1 or 2 mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine under the Emergency Use Authorization based on phase 3 clinical trial efficacy data. Both Pfizer and Moderna have manufactured mRNA-based vaccines with 95% and 94.1% efficacy against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. AstraZeneca has manufactured a vaccine using a viral vector demonstrating early efficacy as well, and this next-generation platform has previously been utilized with the Ebola vaccine and safely administered during pregnancy with an acceptable safety profile. Approval of these vaccines will have a tremendous impact on the ongoing pandemic, yet there remains a lack of data for use of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in pregnant women. In this article, we seek to discuss the available data regarding treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and address the growing questions regarding how best to approach vaccine access and administration in the pregnant population."

1578,Evaluation of the BioFire COVID-19 test and Respiratory Panel 2.1 for rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples.,"The BioFireÂ® COVID-19 Test and Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) are rapid, fully automated assays for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in nasopharyngeal swabs. In the case of the RP2.1, an additional 21 viral and bacterial pathogens can be detected. Both tests have received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration and Interim Order authorization from Health Canada for use in clinical laboratories. We evaluated the performance characteristics of these tests in comparison to a laboratory-developed real-time PCR assay targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and E genes. A total of 78 tests were performed using the BioFire COVID-19 Test, including 30 clinical specimens and 48 tests in a limit of detection study; 57 tests were performed using the RP2.1 for evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 detection, including 30 clinical specimens and 27 tests for limit of detection. Results showed 100% concordance between the BioFire assays and the laboratory-developed test for all clinical samples tested, and acceptable performance of both BioFire assays at their stated limits of detection. Conclusively, the BioFire COVID-19 Test and RP2.1 are highly sensitive assays that can be effectively used in the clinical laboratory for rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing."
1579,Role of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and its mitigation strategies for the development of vaccines and immunotherapies to counter COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global threat and death tolls are increasing worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 though shares similarities with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, immunopathology of the novel virus is not understood properly. Previous reports from SARS and MERS-CoV documents that preexisting, non-neutralizing or poorly neutralizing antibodies developed as a result of vaccine or infection enhance subsequent infection, a phenomenon called as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Since immunotherapy has been implicated for COVID-19 treatment and vaccine is under development, due consideration has to be provided on ADE to prevent untoward reactions. ADE mitigation strategies like the development of vaccine or immunotherapeutics targeting receptor binding motif can be designed to minimize ADE of SARS-CoV-2 since full-length protein-based approach can lead to ADE as reported in MERS-CoV. The present mini-review aims to address the phenomenon of ADE of SARS-CoV-2 through the lessons learned from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and ways to mitigate them so as to develop better vaccines and immunotherapeutics against SARS-CoV-2."
