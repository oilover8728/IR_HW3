6000,The devil in the details: Herd immunity and pandemic response.,"If enough individuals in a population are immune to a pathogen, it cannot cause an outbreak. Deliberately seeking such herd immunity through infection during a potentially lethal pandemic is contrary to all principles of public health, given the potential for uncontrolled outbreaks and risks to vulnerable populations."
6001,"[Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies in Borgosesia (Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) population: a surveillance strategy in post-lockdown period?].","Background: to avoid a new spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the post lockdown period requires the implementation of effective strategies for the case finding and contact tracing. The presence of asymptomatic subjects in the population, that are responsible for about 30% of the new infections, may complicate this phase. Serological tests for the measurement of immune response could represent an effective tool for the rapid monitoring of the population with asymptomatic infections and for estimating the proportion of immune in a territory, too. Objectives: to describe the distribution of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of the Municipality of Borgosesia (Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) and to estimate the efficacy of this strategy for the identification of asymptomatic cases. Design: Cross-sectional study with administration of a rapid test to assess the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. Setting and participants: all subjects resident in Borgosesia over the age of 18, where invited to participate. A rapid serological test was administered to enrolled participants to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies on peripheral blood. Subjects with IgG or IgM positivity were offered to perform a swab test for viral RNA research. Main outcome measures: the prevalence of IgM and IgG, and the relative risks of having positive swab test and of having symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 in the recent past has been estimated. Results: 4,987 subjects participated to study, 44.5% of the adult population of Borgosesia. The average age was 55 years. There was a greater participation of women (54.4%), of people with a higher education level (37.3%) and of people without specific previous symptoms (95.1%). 245 people had a positive test for IgM or IgG, and the estimated prevalence was of 4.9%. 209 out of 245 subjects who were positive to the rapid test underwent to the RT-PCR test and this allowed to isolate 24 positive subjects. Conclusions: the seroprevalence values ​​estimated for subjects residing in the city of Borgosesia which underwent the rapid test for the detection of type M and type G antibodies on peripheral blood, confirmed the population-based estimates reported in literature, in particular with the results of the Italian survey of seroprevalence. Furthermore, the implementation of this test allowed the identification and isolation of completely asymptomatic subjects, that could have been identified only through screening with tests for viral RNA."
6002,"Associations with COVID-19 Symptoms, Prevention Interest, and Testing Among Sexual and Gender Minority Adults in a Diverse National Sample.","Purpose: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) and racial/ethnic minority populations may differ in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention, testing, and vaccine interest, although little research has explored these disparities. It is critical to understand the differential experiences within minoritized communities to ensure effective intervention and vaccine rollout. Methods: In a national online survey of U.S. adult SGM individuals, conducted between April and August 2020, 932 participants responded about COVID-19 testing, symptoms, interest in vaccination, and interest in at-home testing. Bivariate associations between these outcomes and demographic factors, including sexual orientation, gender identity, endorsing intersex traits, gender modality, race/ethnicity, and HIV status were calculated. Results: Despite 24% of the sample reporting COVID-19 symptoms, testing was relatively low at 13.3%. Transgender and bisexual/pansexual individuals were more likely to be interested in a COVID-19 vaccine and an at-home test compared with cisgender and gay/lesbian respondents, respectively. Compared with cisgender individuals, transgender individuals were nearly twice as likely to report COVID-19 symptoms. Latinx individuals were less likely to be interested in a future COVID-19 vaccination and Black individuals were less likely to be interested in an at-home COVID-19 test compared with White participants. Both respondents who endorsed intersex traits and people with HIV were less likely to be interested in an at-home test compared with those who did not endorse having intersex traits and people without HIV, respectively. Conclusions: These results show critical disparities in COVID-19 symptomology and prevention interest within SGM populations that must be taken into account when designing or tailoring effective COVID-19 interventions."
6003,Will access to COVID-19 vaccine in Aotearoa be equitable for priority populations?,"Aim: This research examines the equity implications of the geographic distribution of COVID-19 vaccine delivery locations in Aotearoa New Zealand under five potential scenarios: (1) stadium mega-clinics; (2) Community Based Assessment Centres; (3) GP clinics; (4) community pharmacies; and (5) schools. Method: We mapped the distribution of Aotearoa New Zealand's population and the location of potential vaccine delivery facilities under each scenario. Geostatistical techniques identified population clusters for Māori, Pacific peoples and people aged 65 years and over. We calculated travel times between all potential facilities and each Statistical Area 1 in the country. Descriptive statistics indicate the size and proportion of populations that could face significant travel barriers when accessing COVID-19 vaccinations. Results: Several areas with significant travel times to potential vaccine delivery sites were also communities identified as having an elevated risk of COVID-19 disease and severity. All potential scenarios for vaccine delivery, with the exception of schools, resulted in travel barriers for a substantial proportion of the population. Overall, these travel time barriers disproportionately burden Māori, older communities and people living in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. Conclusion: The equitable delivery of COVID-19 vaccines is key to an elimination strategy. However, if current health services and facilities are used without well-designed and supported outreach services, then access to vaccination is likely to be inequitable."
6004,Cross-country evidence on the association between contact tracing and COVID-19 case fatality rates.,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has killed over a million people since its emergence in late 2019. However, there has been substantial variability in the policies and intensity of diagnostic efforts between countries. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the association between national contact tracing policies and case fatality rates of COVID-19 in 138 countries. Our regression analyses indicate that countries that implement comprehensive contact tracing have significantly lower case fatality rates. This association of contact tracing policy and case fatality rates is robust in our longitudinal regression models, even after controlling for the number of tests conducted and non-pharmaceutical control measures adopted by governments. Our results suggest that comprehensive contact tracing is instrumental not only to curtailing transmission but also to reducing case fatality rates. Contact tracing achieves the early detection and isolation of secondary cases which are particularly important given that the peak in infectiousness occurs during the presymptomatic phase. The early detection achieved by contact tracing accelerates the rate at which infected individuals receive medical care they need to maximize their chance of recovery. In addition, the combination of reduced transmission and more rapid recovery diminishes the burden on the healthcare system which in turn ensures that the resources remain available for individuals who do become infected."
6005,SARS-CoV-2: A comprehensive review from pathogenicity of the virus to clinical consequences.,"Nowadays, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, is the worldwide challenge. The virus is highly contagious, and clinical consequences were very divers. It is estimated that if no effective action is taken, COVID-19 could plague 90% of the world's population and kill over 40 million people. So, it is essential to understand the virus pathogenicity and follow the preventive methods to control the high morbidity and mortality rates. Meanwhile our current knowledge of COVID-19 is still limited, despite hard efforts of scientists and clinicians during last few months. In this review article, we have collected the latest data about characteristics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic methods of SARS-CoV-2."
6006,Neutralizing activity of Sputnik V vaccine sera against SARS-CoV-2 variants.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected at least 180 million people since its identification as the cause of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid pace of vaccine development has resulted in multiple vaccines already in use worldwide. The contemporaneous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 'variants of concern' (VOC) across diverse geographic locales underscores the need to monitor the efficacy of vaccines being administered globally. All WHO designated VOC carry spike (S) polymorphisms thought to enable escape from neutralizing antibodies. Here, we characterize the neutralizing activity of post-Sputnik V vaccination sera against the ensemble of S mutations present in alpha (B.1.1.7) and beta (B.1.351) VOC. Using de novo generated replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus expressing various SARS-CoV-2-S in place of VSV-G (rcVSV-CoV2-S), coupled with a clonal 293T-ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cell line optimized for highly efficient S-mediated infection, we determine that only 1 out of 12 post-vaccination serum samples shows effective neutralization (IC90) of rcVSV-CoV2-S: B.1.351 at full serum strength. The same set of sera efficiently neutralize S from B.1.1.7 and exhibit only moderately reduced activity against S carrying the E484K substitution alone. Taken together, our data suggest that control of some emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants may benefit from updated vaccines."
6007,How can nanotechnology help to combat COVID-19? Opportunities and urgent need.,"Incidents of viral outbreaks have increased at an alarming rate over the past decades. The most recent human coronavirus known as COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has already spread around the world and shown R0 values from 2.2 to 2.68. However, the ratio between mortality and number of infections seems to be lower in this case in comparison to other human coronaviruses (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)). These outbreaks have tested the limits of healthcare systems and have posed serious questions about management using conventional therapies and diagnostic tools. In this regard, the use of nanotechnology offers new opportunities for the development of novel strategies in terms of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and other viral infections. In this review, we discuss the use of nanotechnology for COVID-19 virus management by the development of nano-based materials, such as disinfectants, personal protective equipment, diagnostic systems and nanocarrier systems, for treatments and vaccine development, as well as the challenges and drawbacks that need addressing."
6008,Excess deaths reveal unequal impact of COVID-19 in Ecuador.,"Latin America has struggled to control the transmission of COVID-19. Comparison of excess death (ED) rates during the pandemic reveals that Ecuador is among the highest impacted countries. In this analysis, we update our previous findings with the most complete all-cause mortality records available for 2020, disaggregated by sex, age, ethnicity and geography. Our study shows that in 2020, Ecuador had a 64% ED rate (95% CI 63% to 65%) or 64% more deaths than expected. Men had a higher ED rate, 75% (95% CI 73% to 76%), than women's 51% (95% CI 49% to 52%), and this pattern of higher EDs for men than women held for most age groups. The only exception was the 20-29 age group, where women had 19% more deaths, compared to 10% more deaths for men, but that difference is not statistically significant. The analysis provides striking evidence of the lack of COVID-19 diagnostic testing in Ecuador: the confirmed COVID-19 deaths in 2020 accounted for only 21% of total EDs. Our significant finding is that indigenous populations, who typically account for about 5% of the deaths, show almost four times the ED rate of the majority mestizo group. Indigenous women in each age group have higher ED rates than the general population and, in ages between 20 and 49 years, they have higher ED rates than indigenous men. Indigenous women in the age group 20-29 years had an ED rate of 141%, which is commensurate to the ED rate of indigenous women older than 40 years."
6009,"""To Protect Myself, My Friends, Family, Workmates and Patients and to Play My Part"": COVID-19 Vaccination Perceptions among Health and Aged Care Workers in New South Wales, Australia.","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has globally caused widespread disruption, morbidity and mortality. The uptake of COVID-19 vaccination is critical for minimising further impacts of the pandemic. Health and aged care workers (HACWs) play a central role in public confidence in vaccines and are one of the priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination in Australia. Qualitative phone interviews with 19 HACWs aged 21-50 years old from New South Wales, Australia, were conducted, and the data were analysed thematically in order to understand the factors influencing HACWs' acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. We found that HACWs reported a continuum of COVID-19 vaccination intentions with 12 enthusiastically accepting and 7 hesitant. Using the Behavioral and Social Drivers of COVID-19 Vaccination (BeSD) Framework, we found that participants' acceptance of vaccination was primarily driven by their perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination (such as safety, risk and benefits) and by the information sources, people and norms they trusted. Informed by study findings, we propose several communication strategies which may be helpful in addressing HACWs vaccination acceptance. We note however that as the pandemic continues, further studies with HACWs from diverse backgrounds are needed in order to provide accurate data on diverse motivational and practical drivers of evolving perceptions and attitudes towards vaccination."
