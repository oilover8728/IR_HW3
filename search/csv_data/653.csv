6520,Survival in adult pneumonia inpatients fulfilling suspected COVID-19 criteria and baseline negative RT-qPCR.,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival experience of suspicion COVID-19 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and negative baseline reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test results. Study design: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in Mexico. Methods: Adult pneumonia inpatients fulfilling suspected COVID-19 criteria, and hospital entry from March to August 2020, were enrolled. The Kaplan-Meier method was to use to compare survival estimates among patients with negative RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs and those with a baseline positive test. Results: Data from 64,624 individuals fulfilling suspected COVID-19 criteria were analyzed and 1.6% of them had negative RT-qPCR tests. The overall mortality rate was higher among laboratory-positive patients (48.5% vs. 34.2%, P < 0.001) and, at any given threshold, the survival estimates were higher among RT-qPCR-negative pneumonia inpatients. Conclusions: The pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 remains poorly understood and suspected cases with pneumonia and negative laboratory results represent a major challenge for healthcare systems. Our findings suggest that RT-qPCR-negative inpatients may have an improved disease prognosis, but the in-hospital mortality was still high among them. However, further research is needed to clarify the clinical and epidemiological implications of our results."
6521,COVID-19 Vaccination in Patients with Autoimmune Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases: Clinical Guidance of the Korean College of Rheumatology.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused more than 100 million infections and 2 million deaths worldwide. In up to 20% of cases, COVID-19 infection can take a severe, life-threatening course. Therefore, preventive measures such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and social distancing are important. COVID-19 vaccines that use novel vaccine technology can prevent up to 95% of infections. However, the uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of vaccination in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease (AIIRD), who are immunocompromised due to underlying immune dysfunction and concomitant immunosuppressive treatment, warrants clear guidance. A task force of the Korean College of Rheumatology formulated a set of vaccination guidance based on the currently available data and expert consensus. The currently available COVID-19 vaccines are considered to be safe and effective. Every patient with AIIRD should receive one of the available COVID-19 vaccines unless contraindicated for medical reasons such as prior allergy/anaphylaxis to the COVID-19 vaccine or its components. Patients should continue immunosuppressive treatment for their underlying AIIRD, including biological and targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs). Corticosteroids should be reduced to the lowest dose possible without aggravating the AIIRD. To improve the vaccine response, methotrexate can be withheld for 1-2 weeks after each vaccination, and the timing of rituximab and abatacept infusion should be adjusted if clinically acceptable. Rheumatologists should play a leading role in educating and vaccinating patients with AIIRD."

6523,"Expanded Access Programs, compassionate drug use, and Emergency Use Authorizations during the COVID-19 pandemic.","The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Expanded Access (EA) Program, which allows for compassionate uses of unapproved therapeutics and diagnostics outside of clinical trials, has gained significant traction during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While development of vaccines has been the major focus, uncertainties around new vaccine safety and effectiveness have spawned interest in other pharmacological options. Experimental drugs can also be approved under the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) program, designed to combat infectious disease and other threats. Here, we review the US experience in 2020 with pharmacological EA and EUA approvals during the pandemic. We also provide a description of, and clinical rationale for, each of the EA- or EUA-approved drugs (e.g. remdesivir, convalescent plasma, propofol 2%, hydroxychloroquine, ruxolitinib, bamlanivimab, baricitinib, casirivimab plus imdevimab) during the pandemic and concluding reflections on the EA program and its potential future uses."

6526,Ct Values Do Not Predict Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Transmissibility in College Students.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious and has caused significant medical/socioeconomic impacts. Other than vaccination, effective public health measures, including contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, is critical for deterring viral transmission, preventing infection progression and resuming normal activities. Viral transmission is affected by many factors, but the viral load and vitality could be among the most important ones. Although in vitro studies have indicated that the amount of virus isolated from infected individuals affects the successful rate of virus isolation, whether the viral load carried at the individual level would determine the transmissibility was unknown. We examined whether the cycle threshold (Ct) value, a measurement of viral load by RT-PCR assay, could differentiate the spreaders from the non-spreaders in a population of college students. Our results indicate that while at the population level the Ct value is lower, suggesting a higher viral load, in the symptomatic spreaders than that in the asymptomatic non-spreaders, there is a significant overlap in the Ct values between the two groups. Thus, Ct value, or the viral load, at the individual level could not predict the transmissibility. Instead, a sensitive method to detect the presence of virus is needed to identify asymptomatic individuals who may carry a low viral load but can still be infectious."
6527,Responding to a COVID-19 Outbreak at a Long-Term Care Facility.,"This article describes an outbreak of COVID-19 in a long-term care facility (LTCF) in West Virginia that was the epicenter of the state's pandemic. Beginning with the index case, we describe the sequential order of procedures undertaken by the facility including testing, infection control, treatment, and communication with facility residents, staff, and family members. We also describe the lessons learned during the process and provide recommendations for handling an outbreak at other LTCFs."
6528,Role of the Healthcare Surface Environment in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Transmission and Potential Control Measures.,"The healthcare environment serves as one of the possible routes of transmission of epidemiologically important pathogens, but the role of the contaminated environment on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission remains unclear. We reviewed survival, contamination, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via environmental surfaces and shared medical devices as well as environmental disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have been demonstrated to survive for hours to days on environmental surfaces depending on experimental conditions. The healthcare environment is frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in most studies but without evidence of viable virus. Although direct exposure to respiratory droplets is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, the contaminated healthcare environment can potentially result in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as described with other coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses. It is important to improve thoroughness of cleaning/disinfection practices in healthcare facilities and select effective disinfectants to decontaminate inanimate surfaces and shared patient care items."
6529,The role of chemical biology in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.,"Since late 2019, biomedical labs all over the world have been struggling to cope with the 'new normal' and to find ways in which they can contribute to the fight against COVID-19. In this unique situation where a biomedical issue dominates people's lives and the news cycle, chemical biology has a great deal to contribute. This review will describe the importance of science at the chemistry/biology interface to both understand and combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."
