6360,SARS-CoV-2 virus infection: Targets and antiviral pharmacological strategies.,"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), transmitted person‐to‐person by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), poses a threat to global public health. To present, these are still no clinically approved antibodies or drugs specific for SARS‐CoV‐2, which makes it difficult for controlling the associated pandemic, limited to monitoring and containment. This situation generates a new need for the development of safe and effective treatments. Since SARS‐CoV‐2 shares phylogenetic traits with SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, antiviral medicines may provide some insight into the development of COVID‐19 therapeutics. Besides that, they are being prioritized several FDA‐approved drugs due to the pandemic state. Despite recent advances in the control of the current COVID‐19 pandemic, challenges such as the rapid virus spread and the socioeconomic cost of this outbreak remain for the inexistence of therapeutics agents against SARS‐CoV‐2. From this moment, the in vivo evaluation of FDA‐approved drugs, which until then appears to be effective are recommended, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, nitazoxanide, and ivermectin; besides new targets: Mpro, spike glycoprotein, and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Therefore, these investigations are needed to prove the efficacy and safety of these potential candidates, including their side effects."
6361,[COVID-19 associated pneumonia despite repeatedly negative PCR-analysis from oropharyngeal swabs].,"Patient history and clinical findings: A 46-year old construction worker presented at the emergency department with two orthostatic syncopes. The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient's general practitioner. Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension. Other vital signs without pathological findings. Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung. Findings and diagnosis: Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin. Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates. After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19. Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected. A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia. After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Therapy and course of events: The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending. Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated. While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days. Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis. The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation. Conclusion: This casuistic describes a case of COVID-19 associated pneumonia presenting with typical clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings. Detection of viral RNA was not successful from deep oral swab-samples despite repeated attempts. Finally, PCR-analysis of sputum confirmed the diagnosis. Analysis of deeper airway samples (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal secretions) or stool for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in cases of evident clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and negative PCR results from deep oral swabs."
6362,Challenges of Testing COVID-19 Cases in Bangladesh.,"Keeping the dynamic nature of Coronaviruses (COVID-19) pandemic in mind, we have opted to explore the importance of the decentralization of COVID-19 testing centers across the country of Bangladesh in order to combat the pandemic. In doing so, we considered quantitative, qualitative, and geographic information systems (GIS) datasets to identify the location of existing COVID-19 testing centers. Moreover, we attempted to collect data from the existing centers in order to demonstrate testing times at the divisional level of the country. Results show that the number of testing centers is not enough to cater to the vast population of the country. Additionally, we found that the number of days it takes to receive the results from the COVID-19 testing centers is not optimal at divisional cities, let alone the remote rural areas. Finally, we propose a set of recommendations in order to enhance the existing system to assist more people under a testing range of COVID-19 viruses at the local level."
6363,Production in Escherichia coli of recombinant COVID-19 spike protein fragments fused to CRM197.,"During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic affected almost 108 individuals. Quite a number of vaccines against COVID-19 were therefore developed, and a few recently received authorization for emergency use. Overall, these vaccines target specific viral proteins by antibodies whose synthesis is directly elicited or indirectly triggered by nucleic acids coding for the desired targets. Among these targets, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of COVID-19 spike protein (SP) does frequently occur in the repertoire of candidate vaccines. However, the immunogenicity of RBD per se is limited by its low molecular mass, and by a structural rearrangement of full-length SP accompanied by the detachment of RBD. Here we show that the RBD of COVID-19 SP can be conveniently produced in Escherichia coli when fused to a fragment of CRM197, a variant of diphtheria toxin currently used for a number of conjugated vaccines. In particular, we show that the CRM197-RBD chimera solubilized from inclusion bodies can be refolded and purified to a state featuring the 5 native disulphide bonds of the parental proteins, the competence in binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and a satisfactory stability at room temperature. Accordingly, our observations provide compulsory information for the development of a candidate vaccine directed against COVID-19."

6366,COVID-19 in a Patient Presenting with Syncope and a Normal Chest X-ray.,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has now affected hundreds of thousands of individuals across the world. Amidst this global pandemic, maintaining a high index of suspicion, rapid testing capacity, and infection control measures are required to curtail the virus' rapid spread. While fever and respiratory symptoms have been commonly used to identify COVID-19 suspects, we present an elderly female who arrived to the hospital after a syncopal episode. She was afebrile with a normal chest X-ray and there was no suspicion of COVID-19. She then developed a fever and tested positive for COVID-19. Our unique case underscores the increasing diversity of COVID-19 presentations and potential for initial mis- diagnosis and delay in implementing proper precautions."
6367,A Combination of N and S Antigens With IgA and IgG Measurement Strengthens the Accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 Serodiagnostics.,"Background: Primary diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is based on detection of virus RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples. In addition, analysis of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 has an important role in viral diagnostics and seroprevalence estimates. Methods: We developed and optimized an enzyme immunoassays (EIA) using SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), S1 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, and N proteins from SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and 4 low-pathogenic human CoVs. Neutralizing antibody activity was compared with SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM EIA results. Results: The sensitivity of EIA for detecting immune response in COVID-19 patients (n = 101) was 77% in the acute phase and 100% in the convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection when N and RBD were used as antigens in IgG and IgA specific EIAs. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased humoral immune responses against the 229E and NL63 N proteins. S1 and RBD-based EIA results had a strong correlation with microneutralization test results. Conclusions: The data indicate a combination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD and N proteins and analysis of IgG and IgA immunoglobulin classes in sera provide an excellent basis for specific and sensitive serological diagnostics of COVID-19."
6368,The COVID-19 Diagnostic Dilemma: a Clinician's Perspective.,"In this commentary, we provide a broad overview of how the rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostic landscape has impacted clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We review aspects of both molecular and serologic testing and discuss the logistical challenges faced with each. We also highlight the progress that has been made in the development and implementation of these assays as well as the need for ongoing improvement in diagnostic testing capabilities."
6369,"""No"" to placebo-controlled trials of Covid-19 vaccines.","Recently the WHO Ad Hoc Expert Group proposed that it is ethical to continue placebo-controlled Covid-19 vaccine trials in countries where vaccines are not available even if this vaccine is marketed and being used elsewhere. The reason for this proposal is the usual scientific argument claiming that these trials are the most efficient method to obtain reliable results, and individuals in these countries will continue to get the local standard of care, meaning no vaccination, and thus participants are not being left worse off. We refute this argument on two counts. First the global equity and justice issue, that the scarcity of vaccines in most countries is created by the rich nations that have hoarded vaccines. Second, the science versus research ethics issue, that there are valid scientific methods like non-inferiority trials which can give reliable results, and that applying a standard of care imposed by rich nations is both unethical and possibly exploitative. Thus, we feel that the WHO Ad Hoc Expert Group is wrong in proposing to continue placebo-controlled Covid-19 vaccine trials."
