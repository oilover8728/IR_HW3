760,Pitfall of Universal Pre-Admission Screening for SARS-CoV-2 in a Low Prevalence Country.,"It is unclear whether universal PCR screening for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals prior to admission is useful. From April to December 2020, the positive rate of universal pre-admission screening was 0.005% (4/76,521) in a tertiary care hospital in Korea. The positive rates were not different between the periods (period 1 (daily new patients of <1 per million inhabitants) vs. period 2 (1-8.3 per million inhabitants) vs. period 3 (10.3 to 20 per million inhabitants); P = 0.45). Universal pre-admission screening for SARS-CoV-2 had a lower positive rate than that of symptom-based screening (0.005% vs. 0.049% (53/109,257), p < 0.001). In addition, seven patients with negative pre-admission test results had subsequent positive PCR during hospitalization, and four patients had secondary transmission. Universal pre-admission PCR screening may not be practical in settings of low prevalence of COVID-19, and negative PCR results at admission should not serve as a basis for underestimating the risk of nosocomial spread from asymptomatic patients."
761,How Do We Manage Hematopoietic Cell Transplant during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic?,"Patients receiving a hematopoietic cell transplant are thought to be at increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus infectious disease 2019. Transplant activities at our center continue, and notably, no patient has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, social distancing, masking, and education for patients and donors are major pillars of prevention. We recommend potential transplant recipients and donors to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 with qRT-PCR, serum antibody detection, and a lung CT scan pretransplant. If possible, stem cells from HLA-matched unrelated donors by local processing laboratories should be cryopreserved and shipped before initiating pretransplant conditioning. An alternative HLA-haplotype-matched related donor should be identified and evaluated as a backup. The interval immediately after discharge is the time of greatest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection because of travel and exposure to infected persons. We recommend self-isolation and minimal contact with family members. Nonessential clinic visits should be deferred or substituted with telemedicine consultations if possible. These recommendations are based on our experience at a major transplant center in China. Although some recommendations are evidence based, other recommendations are not and warrant validation in controlled trials."
762,Utility of preoperative polymerase chain reaction testing during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: The challenge of evolving incidence.,"Introduction: Due to its high transmissibility, measures aimed at reducing the spread of SARS CoV2 have become mandatory. Different organizations have recommended performing polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) as part of the preoperative screening of surgical patients. We aimed to determine the performance of PCR testing to detect asymptomatic carriers. Methods: Observational study carried out at a tertiary care center. We compared the results of preoperative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR test (RT-PCR) performed on a cohort of patients pending surgery with the results we would have expected assuming the epidemiological data released by government offices. Results: We registered no positives in the 2,722 preoperative RT-PCR tests performed in our health care area between epidemiological Weeks 18 to 21, meaning a cumulative incidence trending to zero. Assuming public epidemiological data, the probabilistic projection of potential asymptomatic individuals ranged from 0.27 × 10e-4 (according to official data of new cases diagnosed by PCR) to 4.69 × 10e-4 if we assumed cases confirmed by IgG test in our province. Assuming a RT-PCR sensitivity of 95%, to obtain a positive result we should perform 38,461 and 2,028 tests respectively. Conclusions: In scenarios of very low prevalence and despite high sensitivity scores, indiscriminate preoperative RT-PCR screening is of a questionable effectiveness for detecting asymptomatic carriers. Our findings evidence the difficulty of establishing reliable predictive models for the episodic and rapidly evolving incidence of infections such as has characterized the SARS CoV2 pandemic."
763,Atypical presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 in a patient with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis.,"During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, China, we experienced a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with atypical presentations in a patient with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis (AOSC), who was initially admitted with jaundice and fever. The patient had no other typical symptoms of COVID-19 such as cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea except for fever, but her epidemiological history was clear. COVID-19 was finally confirmed by repeated viral nucleic acid testing, but her repetitive lungs CT imaging findings had been atypical. After endoscopic-related operations and antiviral treatment, the patient was subsequently recovered and discharged. This particular case is being reported to provide a reference and guidance for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in AOSC."
764,Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2: A Review on the Current Scenario and Future Outlook.,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has undoubtedly created an emerging disease of topmost public health priority spilling throughout the globe. The diagnosis currently relies on a multiplex of criteria including the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and in vitro diagnostics. Presently, the real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) is considered as the most reliable assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and is being supplemented by other auxiliary tests, including serology and radiology. Many of these molecular and immunological tests have been validated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and commercial kits have been introduced in the field. But, considering the sensitivity and specificity based shortcomings and the lacunae in monitoring the spread of the virus, there is an immense need to develop integrated smart devices based on novel, safe, rapid and accurate diagnostic techniques and implement them on a large scale to curb this outbreak in the country and the world as a whole.

765,How home anterior self-collected nasal swab simplifies SARS-CoV-2 testing: new surveillance horizons in public health and beyond.,"The sample collection procedure for SARS-CoV-2 has a strong impact on diagnostic capability, contact tracing approach, ultimately affecting the infection containment performance. This study demonstrates that self-collected nasal-swab has shown to be a valid and well tolerated procedure to SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in a healthcare system. More significantly, no performance adequacy difference was detected in self-administered swabs between healthcare worker (HCW) and non-HCW which allows to speculate that this procedure could be successfully extended to the entire population for mass screening."
766,COVID-19 vaccines: The status and perspectives in delivery points of view.,"Due to the high prevalence and long incubation periods often without symptoms, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of individuals globally, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Even with the recent approval of the anti-viral drug, remdesivir, and Emergency Use Authorization of monoclonal antibodies against S protein, bamlanivimab and casirimab/imdevimab, efficient and safe COVID-19 vaccines are still desperately demanded not only to prevent its spread but also to restore social and economic activities via generating mass immunization. Recent Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer and BioNTech's mRNA vaccine may provide a pathway forward, but monitoring of long-term immunity is still required, and diverse candidates are still under development. As the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and interactions with the immune system continues to evolve, a variety of drug candidates are under investigation and in clinical trials. Potential vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19 include repurposed drugs, monoclonal antibodies, antiviral and antigenic proteins, peptides, and genetically engineered viruses. This paper reviews the virology and immunology of SARS-CoV-2, alternative therapies for COVID-19 to vaccination, principles and design considerations in COVID-19 vaccine development, and the promises and roles of vaccine carriers in addressing the unique immunopathological challenges presented by the disease."
767,Recent progress on the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and suggestions for prevention and controlling of the pandemic.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has caused a global pandemic in the past year, which poses continuing threat to human beings. To date, more than 3561 mutations in the viral spike protein were identified, including 2434 mutations that cause amino acid changes with 343 amino acids located in the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD). Among these mutations, the most representative ones are substitution mutations such as D614G, N501Y, Y453F, N439K/R, P681H, K417N/T, and E484K, and deletion mutations of ΔH69/V70 and Δ242-244, which confer the virus with enhanced infectivity, transmissibility, and resistance to neutralization. In this review, we discussed the recent findings of SARS-CoV-2 for highlighting mutations and variants on virus transmissibility and pathogenicity. Moreover, several suggestions for prevention and controlling the pandemic are also proposed."
768,Clinical Endpoints for Evaluating Efficacy in COVID-19 Vaccine Trials.,"Several vaccine candidates to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have entered or will soon enter large-scale, phase 3, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials. To facilitate harmonized evaluation and comparison of the efficacy of these vaccines, a general set of clinical endpoints is proposed, along with considerations to guide the selection of the primary endpoints on the basis of clinical and statistical reasoning. The plausibility that vaccine protection against symptomatic COVID-19 could be accompanied by a shift toward more SARS-CoV-2 infections that are asymptomatic is highlighted, as well as the potential implications of such a shift."
769,Dual lateral flow optical/chemiluminescence immunosensors for the rapid detection of salivary and serum IgA in patients with COVID-19 disease.,"To accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection and its time-dependent progression, the rapid, sensitive, and noninvasive determination of immunoglobulins A specific to SARS-CoV-2 (IgA) in saliva and serum is needed to complement tests that detect immunoglobulins G and M. We have developed a dual optical/chemiluminescence format of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) immunosensor for IgA in serum and saliva. A recombinant nucleocapsid antigen specifically captures SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient specimens. A labelled anti-human IgA reveals the bound IgA fraction. A dual colorimetric and chemiluminescence detection enables the affordable and ultrasensitive determination of IgA to SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, a simple smartphone-camera-based device measures the colour signal provided by nanogold-labelled anti-human IgA. For the ultrasensitive chemiluminescence transduction, we used a contact imaging portable device based on cooled CCD, and measured the light signal resulting from the reaction of the HRP-labelled anti-human IgA with a H2O2/luminol/enhancers substrate. A total of 25 serum and 9 saliva samples from infected and/or recovered individuals were analysed by the colorimetric LFIA, which was sensitive and reproducible enough for the semi-quantification of IgA in subjects with a strong serological response and in the early stage of COVID-19 infection. Switching to CL detection, the same immunosensor exhibited higher detection capability, revealing the presence of salivary IgA in infected individuals. For the patients included in the study (n = 4), the level of salivary IgA correlated with the time elapsed from diagnosis and with the severity of the disease. This IgA-LFIA immunosensor could be useful for noninvasively monitoring early immune responses to COVID-19 and for investigating the diagnostic/prognostic utility of salivary IgA in the context of large-scale screening to assess the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."
