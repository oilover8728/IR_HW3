9000,Online learning and COVID-19: a meta-synthesis analysis.,"The COVID-19 pandemic demanded a quick shift from presential to e-learning processes. Unlike planned e-learning programs, medical schools have had to quickly deliver the entire medical curriculum using remote strategies. This study aimed to perform a meta-synthesis of previous pandemic situations and describe the experience of the São Paulo University School of Medicine. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, EMBASE, Lilacs, Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC, using the following keywords: (""SARS"" OR ""severe acute respiratory syndrome"" OR ""severe acute respiratory syndrome"" OR ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"" OR ""middle east respiratory syndrome*"" OR ""MERS-CoV"" OR ""Mers"" OR ""Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome*"" OR ""MERS-CoV*"" OR ""coronavirus"" OR ""Coronavirus Infections"" OR ""coronavirus*"" OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""online education"" OR ""Education, Distance"" OR ""e-learning"" OR ""course online"" OR ""flipped classroom"") AND (""lockdown"" OR ""social distance"" OR ""quarantine""). The endpoints were the online platforms used for online learning, the model of class, recorded versus online interaction, duration of online lectures, and students' and teachers' perceptions of online learning. We retrieved 38 records; only seven articles studied online education methods related to the pandemic and social distancing rules. The most frequently used online platform was Zoom®. The studies examined both synchronous and asynchronous approaches. There was no evidence regarding duration and students' and teachers' attitude. This study suggests that the online learning shift was feasible; however, because of the nature of the education shift (pandemic), future studies must further analyze the educational structure."
9001,[Pathological changes of fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the lungs: report of 10 cases by postmortem needle autopsy].,"Objectives: To observe the pulmonary changes with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in postmortem needle specimens, to detect the presence of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) in the lung tissues, and to analyze the clinicopathological characteristics. Methods: For 10 decedents with 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan, bilateral lungs underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous multi-point puncture autopsy, and pulmonary pathological changes were described in routine hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) slides. Electron microscopy was also performed. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to detect 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in lung tissue, and the pathological characteristics were demonstrated in combination with clinical data analysis. Results: Of the 10 deaths associated with COVID-19, 7 were male and 3 were female. The average age was 70 (39-87) years. Medical record showed that 7 patients had underlying diseases. The average course of disease was 30 (16-36) days. Nine cases showed fibrinous and suppurative exudation in the alveolar cavity accompanied by the formation of hyaline membrane, and fibroblastic proliferation of alveolar septum. Type Ⅱ alveolar epithelial cells showed reactive hyperplasia and desquamation. Many macrophages accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Capillary hyaline thrombus and intravascular mixed thrombus were noted. In some cases, acute bronchiolitis with mucous membrane exfoliation, accumulation of bronchiolar secretions, and bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia occurred. In the cohort, a large number of bacteria (cocci) were detected in 1 case and a large number of fungi (yeast type) were detected in 1 case. Nine cases were positive for the nucleic acids of 2019-nCoV while one case remained negative by RT-PCR. Coronavirus particles were detected in the cytoplasm of type Ⅱ alveolar epithelium. Conclusions: The pulmonary pathological changes of fatal COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), mainly in the acute exudative stage and the organic proliferative stage. There are fibrinous exudate aggregation in alveolar cavity with hyaline membrane formation, fibroblastic proliferation in alveolar septum, and alveolar epithelial cell injuries with reactive hyperplasia and desquamation of type Ⅱ alveolar epithelial cells. A large amount of neutrophils and monocytes infiltration is present in most cases and bacteria and fungi are detected in some cases, suggesting a serious bacterial or fungal infection secondary to the DAD."
9002,Clinical risk profile associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications in the emergency area of a pediatric COVID-19 center.,"Background: In February 2020, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was classified as a pandemic. In the pediatric population, coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 has a reported mortality of less than 6% in complicated cases; however, the clinical characteristics and severity are not the same as those presented in the adult population. This study aimed to describe the clinical manifestations of patients younger than 18 years old and their association with the confirmation of the test and outcomes. Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study of symptoms suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All subjects with a confirmatory test for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Initial symptoms, history of influenza vaccination, and previous contact were documented, and mortality and the requirement for assisted mechanical ventilation were identified. The proportions of the variables were compared with the χ2 test. The odds ratio for a positive test and the requirement of intubation was calculated. Results: Of a total of 510 subjects, 76 (15%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The associated symptoms were chest pain, sudden onset of symptoms, and general malaise. The variable most associated with contagion was the exposure to a relative with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Infants and subjects without the influenza vaccine showed an increased risk for respiratory complications. Conclusions: The frequency of positivity in the test was 15% (infants and adolescents represented 64% of the confirmed cases), and the associated factors identified were contact with a confirmed case, sudden onset of symptoms, and chest pain."
9003,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Immunodeficient Host: Necessary and Dispensable Immune Pathways.,"Since its outbreak in late December 2019 in Wuhan, coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has posed a therapeutic challenge for the world population, with a plenty of clinical pictures and a broad spectrum of severity of the manifestations. In spite of initial speculations on a direct role of primary or acquired immune deficiency in determining a worse disease outcome, recent studies have provided evidence that specific immune defects may either serve as an experimentum naturae entailing this risk or may not be relevant enough to impact the host defense against the virus. Taken together, these observations may help unveil pathogenetic mechanisms of the infection and suggest new therapeutic strategies. Thus, in this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and clinical manifestations with a special focus on children and patients presenting with congenital or acquired immune deficiency."
9004,Primary Immune Response Provides Protective Efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection.,"While there is absolutely no evidence to ensure recovered patients are either likely or unlikely to get reinfected. But studies in non-human primates indicate that reinfection of recovered patients is highly unlikely. It is also clear that primary immune responses or induced immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 remain in circulation for several months and at least temporarily confer immunity to protect from reinfection. In addition, negative virus culture analysis of re-positive suggests that positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions in recovered patients are more likely to be false-positive, or detection of genetic remnants of virus discharged from lesions of lungs or better sampling at the time of repeat analysis. However, emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants are likely to be causing the infections observed in some of the recovered patients."

9006,The diagnosis of pneumonia in a pregnant woman with coronavirus disease 2019 using maternal lung ultrasound.,"Lung ultrasound examination has been demonstrated to be an accurate imaging method to detect pulmonary and pleural conditions. During pregnancy, there is a need for rapid assessment of the maternal lung in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019. We report our experience on lung ultrasound examination in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in a pregnant woman. Typical ultrasound features of this pulmonary pathology, including diffuse hyperechoic vertical artifacts with thickened pleural line and ""white lung"" with patchy distribution, were observed. We suggest point-of-care lung ultrasound examination as a diagnostic imaging tool in pregnant women with suspected coronavirus disease 2019."
9007,SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Animals: Reservoirs for Reverse Zoonosis and Models for Study.,"The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought many questions over the origin of the virus, the threat it poses to animals both in the wild and captivity, and the risks of a permanent viral reservoir developing in animals. Animal experiments have shown that a variety of animals can become infected with the virus. While coronaviruses have been known to infect animals for decades, the true intermediate host of the virus has not been identified, with no cases of SARS-CoV-2 in wild animals. The screening of wild, farmed, and domesticated animals is necessary to help us understand the virus and its origins and prevent future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases. There is intriguing evidence that farmed mink infections (acquired from humans) have led to infection of other farm workers in turn, with a recent outbreak of a mink variant in humans in Denmark. A thorough examination of the current knowledge and evidence of the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect different animal species is therefore vital to evaluate the threat of animal to human transmission and reverse zoonosis."
9008,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adults (MIS-C/A): Case definition & guidelines for data collection, analysis, and presentation of immunization safety data.","This is a Brighton Collaboration Case Definition of the term ""Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and Adults (MIS-C/A)"" to be utilized in the evaluation of adverse events following immunization. The case definition was developed by topic experts convened by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in the context of active development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. The format of the Brighton Collaboration was followed, including an exhaustive review of the literature, to develop a consensus definition and defined levels of certainty. The document underwent peer review by the Brighton Collaboration Network and by selected expert external reviewers prior to submission. The comments of the reviewers were taken into consideration and edits incorporated into this final manuscript."
9009,"Main differences between the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Madrid, Spain.","Background: The emergence and rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a major challenge to health services, and has disrupted social and economic activities worldwide. In Spain, the first pandemic wave started in mid-March 2020 and lasted for 3 months, requiring home confinement and strict lockdown. Following relaxation of the measures during the summer, a second wave commenced in mid-September 2020 and extended until Christmas 2020. Methods: The two pandemic waves were compared using information collected from rapid diagnostic tests and polymerase chain reaction assays at one university clinic in Madrid, the epicentre of the pandemic in Spain. Results: In total, 1569 individuals (968 during the first wave and 601 during the second wave) were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using fingerprick capillary blood. In addition, during the second wave, 346 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antigen using either oral swabs or saliva. The overall seroprevalence of first-time-tested individuals was 12.6% during the first wave and 7.7% during the second wave (P < 0.01). Seroconversions and seroreversions within 6 months occurred at low rates, both below 5%. During the second wave, 3.5% of tested individuals were SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive, with two cases considered as re-infections. Severe clinical symptoms occurred in a greater proportion of cases during the first wave compared with the second wave (27.8% vs 10.6%, respectively; P = 0.03). Conclusion: The cumulative seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Madrid at the end of 2020 was approximately 20%. Seroreversions within 6 months occurred in 4% of cases. Seroconversions and re-infections were clinically less severe during the second wave than during the first wave. Hypothetically, a lower viral inoculum as a result of social distancing, increased use of face masks, promotion of outdoor activities and restrictions on gatherings may have contributed to this lower pathogenicity."
