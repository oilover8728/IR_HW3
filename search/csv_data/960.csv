9590,[Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children after SARS-CoV-2 infection].,"In the era of the coronavirus disease pandemic, a new disease entity named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children has emerged. This is a case report of a seven-year-old boy with hyperinflammation and cardiac involvement, compatible with this disease entity. Antibody tests and symptoms indicated previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The patient was treated according to international guidelines with full symptom resolution. Awareness of this inflammatory syndrome should prompt immediate treatment and could possibly avoid fatal outcomes."
9591,Geographical Distribution of Genetic Variants and Lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile.,"The pandemic caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a worldwide public health concern. First confined in China and then disseminated widely across Europe and America, SARS-CoV-2 has impacted and moved the scientific community around the world to working in a fast and coordinated way to collect all possible information about this virus and generate new strategies and protocols to try to stop the infection. During March 2020, more than 16,000 full viral genomes have been shared in public databases that allow the construction of genetic landscapes for tracking and monitoring the viral advances over time and study the genomic variations present in geographic regions. In this work, we present the occurrence of genetic variants and lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile during March to April 2020. Complete genome analysis of 141 viral samples from different regions of Chile revealed a predominance of variant D614G like in Europe and the USA and the major presence of lineage B.1. These findings could help take control measures due to the similarity of the viral variants present in Chile, compared with other countries, and monitor the dynamic change of virus variants in the country."
9592,The SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus and the COVID-19 Outbreak.,"The SARS-CoV-2, a newly identified Î²-coronavirus, is the causative agent of the third large-scale pandemic from the last two decades. The outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China. The patients presented clinical symptoms of dry cough, fever, dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltrates on imaging. By February 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognized and designated this virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 uses the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), used by SARS-CoV to infect humans. One hypothesis of SARSCoV-2 origin indicates that it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARSCoV-2, being the intermediate host not yet determined. The predominant route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is from human to human. As of May 10th 2020, the number of worldwide confirmed COVID-19 cases is over 4 million, while the number of global deaths is around 279.000 people. The United States of America (USA) has the highest number of COVID-19 cases with over 1.3 million cases followed by Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, Russia, France and Germany with over 223.000, 218.000, 215.000, 209.000, 176.000, and 171.000 cases, respectively."
9593,"Progress in Studies on Structural and Remedial Aspects of Newly Born Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.","The article highlights an up-to-date progress in studies on structural and the remedial aspects of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, renamed as SARS-CoV-2, leading to the disease COVID-19, a pandemic. In general, all CoVs including SARS-CoV-2 are spherical positive single-stranded RNA viruses containing spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, where S protein has a Receptor-binding Domain (RBD) that mediates the binding to host cell receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). The article details the repurposing of some drugs to be tried for COVID-19 and presents the status of vaccine development so far. Besides drugs and vaccines, the role of Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy to treat COVID-19 is also discussed."
9594,SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): Beginning to Understand a New Virus.,"Within the last two decades, several members of the Coronaviridae family demonstrated epidemic potential. In late 2019, an unnamed genetic relative, later named SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), erupted in the highly populous neighborhoods of Wuhan, China. Unchecked, COVID-19 spread rapidly among interconnected communities and related households before containment measures could be enacted. At present, the mortality rate of COVID-19 infection worldwide is 6.6%. In order to mitigate the number of infections, restrictions or recommendations on the number of people that can gather in a given area have been employed by governments worldwide. For governments to confidently lift these restrictions as well as counter a potential secondary wave of infections, alternative medications and diagnostic strategies against COVID-19 are urgently required. This review has focused on these issues."
9595,Influenza vaccine community outreach: Leveraging an interprofessional healthcare student workforce to immunize marginalized populations.,"Vulnerable populations such as the uninsured, unemployed, and unhoused face significant morbidity and mortality from influenza but are less likely to receive the annual vaccine and have limited access to medical care. We describe an interprofessional, student-run vaccine outreach program (VOP) in Davidson County, Tennessee that lowers barriers to vaccination through free vaccination events in nontraditional community locations. We provide this framework as a model to expand novel, seasonal, or outbreak-oriented vaccine outreach to resource-poor populations. Demographic data were collected from the patients who received an influenza vaccine between 2015 and 2019 through an optional survey to determine whether these events were reaching unhoused, uninsured, and/or unemployed individuals. Of 1,803 patients, 1,733 (96.1%) completed at least one field of the demographic form. Overall, 481 (27.8%) were individuals without homes or living in temporary housing and 673 (38.8%) were unemployed. Most patients, 1,109 (64.0%), did not have health insurance at any point during the prior two years. With the addition of a nurse practitioner student to VOP leadership, the 2018-2019 VOP reached the most unhoused or temporarily-housed (228, 32.3%), unemployed (313, 18.5%), and disabled (60, 8.5%) patients. The VOP can be adapted to meet community needs, funding, and volunteer interest. The VOP model may be applicable to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, especially since the economic impact of COVID-19 has increased unemployment rates and housing instability. Healthcare students serve as an eager, underutilized resource who can be leveraged to disseminate vaccines to individuals with limited access to care."
9596,EPICOVID19 protocol: repeated serological surveys on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Brazil.,"The first case of COVID-19 was reported in China in December 2019, and, as the virus has spread worldwide, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. Estimates on the number of COVID-19 cases do not reflect it real magnitude as testing is limited. Population based data on the proportion of the population with antibodies is relevant for planning public health policies. We aim to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, presence of signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and adherence to isolation measures. A random sample comprising 133 sentinel cities from all states of the country will be selected. Three serological surveys, three weeks apart, will be conducted. The most populous municipality in each intermediate region of the country, defined by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, was chosen as sentinel city. In each city, 25 census tracts will be selected, and 10 households will be systematically sampled in each tract, totaling 33,250 participants. In each household, one inhabitant will be randomly selected to be interviewed and tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, using WONDFO SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test. By evaluating a representative sample of Brazilian sentinel sites, this study will provide essential information for the design of health policies."
9597,D-Dimer Concentrations and COVID-19 Severity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recently described infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since late 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread in virtually all countries, imposing the adoption of significant lockdown and social distancing measures. The activation of the coagulation cascade is a common feature of disseminated intravascular coagulation and adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis aiming to investigate differences in serum D-dimer concentrations in patients with and without severe COVID-19 disease. An electronic search in Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science was performed with no language restrictions, and 13 articles were reporting on 1,807 patients (585, 32.4% with severe disease) were finally identified and included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results of all studies revealed that the D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher in patients with more severe COVID-19 (SMD: 0.91 mg/L; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.07 mg/L, p < 0.0001). The heterogeneity was moderate (I 2 = 46.5%; p = 0.033). Sensitivity analysis showed that the effect size was not modified when any single study was in turn removed (effect size range, 0.87 mg/L to 0.93 mg/L). The Begg's (p = 0.76) and Egger's tests (p = 0.38) showed no publication bias. In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis showed that serum D-dimer concentrations in patients with severe COVID-19 are significantly higher when compared to those with non-severe forms."
9598,Co-infection of COVID-19 and influenza A in a hemodialysis patient: a case report.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus that was first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. With the growing numbers of community spread cases worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Like influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be mainly transmitted by droplets and direct contact, and COVID-19 has a similar disease presentation to influenza. Here we present a case of influenza A and COVID-19 co-infection in a 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. Case presentation: A 60-year-old man with ESRD on hemodialysis presented for worsening cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The patient first developed a mild fever (37.8 Â°C) during hemodialysis 3 days prior to presentation and has been experiencing worsening flu-like symptoms, including fever of up to 38.6 Â°C, non-productive cough, generalized abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and liquid green diarrhea. He lives alone at home with no known sick contacts and denies any recent travel or visits to healthcare facilities other than the local dialysis center. Rapid flu test was positive for influenza A. Procalcitonin was elevated at 5.21 ng/mL with a normal white blood cell (WBC) count. Computed tomography (CT) chest demonstrated multifocal areas of consolidation and extensive mediastinal and hilar adenopathy concerning for pneumonia. He was admitted to the biocontainment unit of Nebraska Medicine for concerns of possible COVID-19 and was started on oseltamivir for influenza and vancomycin/cefepime for the probable bacterial cause of his pneumonia and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal (GI) pathogen panel and Clostridioides difficile toxin assay were negative. On the second day of admission, initial nasopharyngeal swab came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patient received supportive care and resumed bedside hemodialysis in strict isolation, and eventually fully recovered from COVID-19. Conclusions: We presented a case of co-infection of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in a hemodialysis patient. The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection should not be overlooked even when other viruses including influenza can explain the clinical symptoms, especially in high-risk patients."
9599,Postnatal SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunological reaction: A prospective family cohort study.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDâ19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSâCoVâ2) appears milder in children but little is known about neonates and about the chains of infections after delivery.1â3 When in early March 2020 a midwife in our large maternity and perinatal center returned from vacation in Ischgl, Austria, she triggered a COVIDâ19 outbreak affecting 36 midwives, nurses and doctors. We reported previously on the successful containment of this outbreak and characterized the clinical symptoms and immunoglobulin development in staff members exposed to SARSâCoVâ2.4â5"
