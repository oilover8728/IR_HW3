7500,Structure of Nonstructural Protein 1 from SARS-CoV-2.,"The periodic emergence of novel coronaviruses (CoVs) represents an ongoing public health concern with significant health and financial burdens worldwide. The most recent occurrence originated in the city of Wuhan, China, where a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) emerged causing severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. The continual emergence of novel coronaviruses underscores the importance of developing effective vaccines as well as novel therapeutic options that target either viral functions or host factors recruited to support coronavirus replication. The CoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) has been shown to promote cellular mRNA degradation, block host cell translation, and inhibit the innate immune response to virus infection. Interestingly, deletion of the nsp1-coding region in infectious clones prevented the virus from productively infecting cultured cells. Because of nsp1's importance in the CoV life cycle, it has been highlighted as a viable target for both antiviral therapy and vaccine development. However, the fundamental molecular and structural mechanisms that underlie nsp1 function remain poorly understood, despite its critical role in the viral life cycle. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the amino globular portion of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 (residues 10 to 127) at 1.77-Å resolution. A comparison of our structure with the SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 structure reveals how mutations alter the conformation of flexible loops, inducing the formation of novel secondary structural elements and new surface features. Paired with the recently published structure of the carboxyl end of nsp1 (residues 148 to 180), our results provide the groundwork for future studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 structure and function during the viral life cycle.IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. One protein known to play a critical role in the coronavirus life cycle is nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1). As such, it has been highlighted in numerous studies as a target for both the development of antivirals and the design of live-attenuated vaccines. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structure of nsp1 derived from SARS-CoV-2 at 1.77-Å resolution. This structure will facilitate future studies focusing on understanding the relationship between structure and function for nsp1. In turn, understanding these structure-function relationships will allow nsp1 to be fully exploited as a target for both antiviral development and vaccine design."
7501,Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor has come of age: From a vaccine adjuvant to antiviral immunotherapy.,"GM-CSF acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and a key growth factor produced by several immune cells such as macrophages and activated T cells. In this review, we discuss recent studies that point to the crucial role of GM-CSF in the immune response against infections. Upon induction, GM-CSF activates four main signalling networks including the JAK/STAT, PI3K, MAPK, and NFκB pathways. Many of these transduction pathways such as JAK/STAT signal via proteins commonly activated with other antiviral signalling cascades, such as those induced by IFNs. GM-CSF also helps defend against respiratory infections by regulating alveolar macrophage differentiation and enhancing innate immunity in the lungs. Here, we also summarize the numerous clinical trials that have taken advantage of GM-CSF's mechanistic attributes in immunotherapy. Moreover, we discuss how GM-CSF is used as an adjuvant in vaccines and how its activity is interfered with to reduce inflammation such as in the case of COVID-19. This review brings forth the current knowledge on the antiviral actions of GM-CSF, the associated signalling cascades, and its application in immunotherapy."
7502,Comparison of commercial realtime reverse transcription PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"The emergence of a new coronavirus in Wuhan China has triggered a global need for accurate diagnostic assays. Initially, mostly laboratory developed molecular tests were available but shortly thereafter different commercial assays started to appear and are still increasing in number. Although independent performance evaluations are ongoing, available data is still scarce. Here we provide a direct comparison of key performance characteristics of 13 commercial RT-PCR assays. Thirteen RT-PCR assays were selected based on the criteria that they can be used following generic RNA extraction protocols, on common PCR platforms and availability. Using a 10-fold and 2-fold dilution series of a quantified SARS-CoV-2 cell-cultured virus stock, performance was assessed compared to our in house validated assay. Specificity was tested by using RNA extracted from cultured common human coronaviruses. All RT-PCR kits included in this study exhibited PCR efficiencies > 90%, except for the Sentinel Diagnostics B E-gene RUO assay (80%). Analytical sensitivity varied between 3.3 RNA copies to 330 RNA copies. Only one assay cross reacted with another human coronavirus (MERS). This study provides a technical baseline of 13 different commercial PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection that can be used by laboratories interested in purchasing any of these for further full clinical validation."
7503,Odds Ratio Estimation of Medical Students' Attitudes towards COVID-19 Vaccination.,"This study investigated the attitudes of Slovak medical students to COVID-19 vaccination. A cross-sectional study was conducted between 10 March 2021 and 24 March 2021, as the second wave of coronavirus spread in Slovakia. It was performed in four medical faculties with students in years 1-6. An online anonymous questionnaire was distributed through official university platforms. The survey was completed by 1228 of 5374 medical students. The vaccinated group of students had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The study was conducted on 1228 students, of which 880 (71.7%) were vaccinated and 348 unvaccinated (28.3%). The median age was 22 years (range 18-33 years), and 70.6% were women. The lowest vaccination rate was among first (32.7%) and second-year students (61.6%), students living at home with their family (63.8%) and students living in urban areas (69.8%). Only 22.4% of medical students were concerned about serious side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine, and 38.8% were concerned that the COVID-19 vaccine may not be effective. This study provides key information related to medical student vaccination in Slovakia and education about COVID-19 vaccination."
7504,Development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) thermal inactivation method with preservation of diagnostic sensitivity.,"Various treatments and agents had been reported to inactivate RNA viruses. Of these, thermal inactivation is generally considered an effective and cheap method of sample preparation for downstream assays. The purpose of this study is to establish a safe inactivation method for SARS-CoV-2 without compromising the amount of amplifiable viral genome necessary for clinical diagnoses. In this study, we demonstrate the infectivity and genomic stability of SARSCoV- 2 by thermal inactivation at both 56°C and 65°C. The results substantiate that viable SARS-CoV-2 is readily inactivated when incubated at 56°C for 30 min or at 65°C for 10 min. qRT-PCR of specimens heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min or 65°C for 15 min revealed similar genomic RNA stability compared with non-heat inactivated specimens. Further, we demonstrate that 30 min of thermal inactivation at 56°C could inactivate viable viruses from clinical COVID-19 specimens without attenuating the qRT-PCR diagnostic sensitivity. Heat treatment of clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients at 56°C for 30 min or 65°C for 15 min could be a useful method for the inactivation of a highly contagious agent, SARS-CoV-2. Use of this method would reduce the potential for secondary infections in BSL2 conditions during diagnostic procedures. Importantly, infectious virus can be inactivated in clinical specimens without compromising the sensitivity of the diagnostic RT-PCR assay."
7505,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests with different antigen targets.,"Background: These last months, dozens of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests have become available with varying performances. A major effort was completed to compare 17 serological tests available in April 2020 in Switzerland. Methods: In a preliminary phase, we compared 17 IgG, IgM, IgA and pan Ig serological tests including ELISA, LFA, CLIA and ECLIA on a panel of 182 sera, comprising 113 sera from hospitalized patients with a positive RT-PCR, and 69 sampled before 1st November 2019, expected to give a positive and negative results, respectively. In a second phase, the five best performing and most available tests were further evaluated on a total of 582 sera (178 and 404 expected positive and negative, respectively), allowing the assessment of 20 possible cross-reactions with other viruses. Results: In the preliminary phase, among eight IgG/pan-Ig ELISA or CLIA/ECLIA tests, five had a sensitivity and specificity above 90 % and 98 % respectively, and on six IgM/IgA tests, only one was acceptable. Only one LFA test on three showed good performances for both IgG and IgM. For all the tests IgM and IgG aroused concomitantly. In the second phase, no test showed particular cross-reaction. We observed an important heterogeneity in the development of the antibody response. Conclusions: The majority of the evaluated tests exhibited high performances of IgG/pan-Ig sensitivity and specificity to detect the serological response of moderately to critically ill hospitalized patients. The IgM and IgA tests showed mostly insufficient performances with no added value for the early diagnostic on the cohort tested in this study."
7506,Vaccine allergy: evidence to consider for COVID-19 vaccines.,"Purpose of review: Whereas the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives worldwide, we hope that vaccination can combat the disease. We propose how to evaluate suspected severe allergic reactions to the vaccines so that as many as possible may be safely vaccinated. Recent findings: Rare cases of severe allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination have been observed, seemingly at a higher frequency than for other vaccines. Few excipients are likely to have caused these reactions. IgE-mediated reactions to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and its derivatives are the most suspected, albeit hitherto unproven, causes. We suggest to make a diagnosis based on skin tests with PEG and PEG derivatives and that these be considered in relation to the decisions required before the first and the second vaccine dose. A vaccine without these excipients is available, but published data about its side effects are limited. Summary: The underlying immunological mechanisms of the rare severe allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines are poorly understood and need to be clarified. Identifying those who have an undiagnosed allergy to PEG and PEG derivatives is crucial before vaccination, and these substances are found in laxatives, cosmetics and in 30% of all our medications today."
7507,First Report of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.251 lineage in Brazil.,"On 29 January 2021, we identified a new circulating lineage of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Brazil, located in Sergipe state, Northeast region. The B.1.1.251 lineage was identified in a 32-old-man with headache, sore throat and coryza. Further studies are needed to evaluate the transmissibility and virulence of this emergent coronavirus lineage in Brazil."
7508,The Sheba Medical Center healthcare workers' children's school: can we open schools safely?,"Objective: The role of school closure in mitigating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission has been questioned. In our medical centre, during a 9-week national lockdown, an alternative school was opened for health-care workers' (HCW) children with a small number of children per class and strict symptom surveillance. After lockdown was lifted we screened children and their parents for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serology. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCW parents and their children after one teacher contracted COVID-19 following exposure at home and 53 children were exposed, isolated and tested by RT-PCR. We compared families with children attending the alternative school with families whose children who remained at home during the 9-week lockdown. Epidemiological and medical data were collected using a short questionnaire; nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and blood was collected for SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG titres. Results: A total of 435 children attended the Sheba alternative school. Among the 53 children exposed to the infected teacher, none tested positive by RT-PCR. Of these, 18 children-parent pairs were tested for serology and all were negative. A total of 106/435 (24%) children and their 78 parents were recruited for the cross-sectional study; 70 attended the Sheba school and 36 did not. Approximately 16% of children in either group reported symptoms (11/70 in the school group and 6/36 in the 'stay home' group), but SARS-CoV-2 was not detected by PCR in any, and previous exposure, as determined by serological tests, was low and not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: In an alternative school for children of HCWs, active during COVID-19 national outbreak, we found no evidence of increased infection compared with children that stayed home."
7509,"Based on Principles and Insights of COVID-19 Epidemiology, Genome Sequencing, and Pathogenesis: Retrospective Analysis of Sinigrin and Prolixin(RX) (Fluphenazine) Provides Off-Label Drug Candidates.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative pathogen of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). So far, no approved therapy has been developed to halt the spread of the pathogen, and unfortunately, the strategies for developing a new therapy will require a long time and very extensive resources. Therefore, drug repurposing has emerged as an ideal strategy toward a smart, versatile, quick way to confine the lethal disease. In this endeavor, natural products have been an untapped source for new drugs. This review represents the confederated experience of multidisciplinary researchers of 99 articles using several databases: Google Scholar, Science Direct, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. To establish the hypothesis, a Bayesian perspective of a systematic review was used to outline evidence synthesis. Our docking documentation of 69 compounds and future research agenda assumptions were directed toward finding an effective and economic anti-COVID-19 treatment from natural products. Glucosinolate, flavones, and sulfated nitrogenous compounds demonstrate direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity through inhibition protease enzymes and may be considered potential candidates against coronavirus. These findings could be a starting point to initiate an integrative study that may encompass interested scientists and research institutes to test the hypothesis in vitro, in vivo, and in clinics after satisfying all ethical requirements."
