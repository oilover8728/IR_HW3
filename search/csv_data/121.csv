1200,Validation of a One-Step Reverse Transcription-Droplet Digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) Approach to Detect and Quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Nasopharyngeal Swabs.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has rapidly spread worldwide from the beginning of 2020. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) is, to this day, the preferred methodology for viral RNA detection, even if not without problems. To overcome some of the limitations still existing for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids in various applications, the use of one-step reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) has been established. The purpose of this study was, then, to evaluate the efficacy of ddPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, optimizing the detection of low-viral load-burdened samples. Methods: The RT-ddPCR workflow was validated for sensitivity, specificity, linearity, reproducibility, and precision using samples from 90 COVID-19-infected patients referred to the Department of Laboratory Medicine of the University Hospital of Udine (Italy). Results: The present study shows that RT-ddPCR allows the detection of as low as 10.3 copies of a SARS-COV-2 E-gene per sample with a higher level of accuracy and precision, especially at low concentration. Conclusion: During the postpeak phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is essential to rely on a highly robust molecular biology method to identify infected subjects, whether they have symptoms or not, in order to prepare appropriate containment measures."
1201,"Interim Estimates of Vaccine Effectiveness of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Health Care Personnel, First Responders, and Other Essential and Frontline Workers - Eight U.S. Locations, December 2020-March 2021.","Messenger RNA (mRNA) BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trials (1,2); however, the benefits of these vaccines for preventing asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection, particularly when administered in real-world conditions, is less well understood. Using prospective cohorts of health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers* in eight U.S. locations during December 14, 2020-March 13, 2021, CDC routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 infections every week regardless of symptom status and at the onset of symptoms consistent with COVID-19-associated illness. Among 3,950 participants with no previous laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,479 (62.8%) received both recommended mRNA doses and 477 (12.1%) received only one dose of mRNA vaccine.† Among unvaccinated participants, 1.38 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) per 1,000 person-days.§ In contrast, among fully immunized (≥14 days after second dose) persons, 0.04 infections per 1,000 person-days were reported, and among partially immunized (≥14 days after first dose and before second dose) persons, 0.19 infections per 1,000 person-days were reported. Estimated mRNA vaccine effectiveness for prevention of infection, adjusted for study site, was 90% for full immunization and 80% for partial immunization. These findings indicate that authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are effective for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of symptom status, among working-age adults in real-world conditions. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all eligible persons."
1202,Serological response to a single dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.,"The delays in the production and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines and the growing number of fatal infections across the globe raised the question whether it would be more advantageous to vaccinate a larger group of individuals with one dose instead of a smaller one with two doses. Through a group of vaccinated healthcare workers, we describe the qualitative and quantitative serological response to a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. We found that, before the second dose inoculation, 95.3 % (182/191) already had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and, half of them, antibodies concentrations against RBD (the key target of neutralizing antibodies) that reached maximum values for the used evaluation immunoassay. In order to improve the execution of vaccination programs, further studies are needed to assess whether there are individuals for whom a single dose of mRNA vaccine or a delay in the inoculation of the second dose, produce a sufficient immune response. Additionally, follow-up studies will help in understanding post-vaccination immunity, how long it lasts and how it relates to infection and reinfection."
1203,A preliminary report of a randomized controlled phase 2 trial of the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.,"Background: Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 8 sites in the USA, in healthy adults aged ≥18 years with no known history or risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had not previously received an investigational CoV vaccine or treatment. Participants were stratified into two age cohorts (≥18-<55 and ≥55) and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either 50 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273, or placebo administered as two intramuscular injections 28 days apart. The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding antibody level (bAb). Secondary outcome was immunogenicity assessed by SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) response. Results: Between 29 May and 8 July 2020, 600 participants were randomized, 300 per age cohort. The most common solicited adverse reactions were pain at injection site, headache, and fatigue following each vaccination in both age cohorts. One serious adverse event deemed unrelated by the site investigator occurred 33 days post-vaccination one. mRNA-1273 induced bAb and nAb by 28 days post-vaccination one that were higher at the 100 µg dose relative to the 50 µg dose; this difference was less apparent post-vaccination two. Binding antibodies and nAb increased substantially by 14 days following the second vaccination (day 43) to levels exceeding those of convalescent sera and remained elevated through day 57. Conclusions: Vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in participants 18 years and older, with an acceptable safety profile, confirming the safety and immunogenicity of 50 and 100 µg mRNA-1273 given as a 2 dose-regimen.

1204,JMM Profile: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is the cause of an infection known as coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 has become a global source of morbidity, mortality and social disruption since its emergence in East Asia in late 2019 and subsequent pandemic spread. Typical symptoms include cough, sore throat, fever, and sudden loss of taste and smell. Persistent, post-infection sequelae have been noted in a minority of cases. Severe complications and deaths occur mostly in older adults. Laboratory confirmation can be performed by viral RNA and antigen detection in nasal swabs or by detecting specific neutralizing antibodies. There is no effective and approved antiviral treatment, but several vaccines with favourable safety and efficacy profiles are being used in mass vaccination programmes. Vaccine-based COVID control should be seen as an addition to existing hygiene measures such as physical distancing, increased hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and barrier protection with personal protective equipment for frontline healthcare workers and other high-risk professions."
1205,Considerations for diagnostic COVID-19 tests.,"During the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, design, development, validation, verification and implementation of diagnostic tests were actively addressed by a large number of diagnostic test manufacturers. Hundreds of molecular tests and immunoassays were rapidly developed, albeit many still await clinical validation and formal approval. In this Review, we summarize the crucial role of diagnostic tests during the first global wave of COVID-19. We explore the technical and implementation problems encountered during this early phase in the pandemic, and try to define future directions for the progressive and better use of (syndromic) diagnostics during a possible resurgence of COVID-19 in future global waves or regional outbreaks. Continuous global improvement in diagnostic test preparedness is essential for more rapid detection of patients, possibly at the point of care, and for optimized prevention and treatment, in both industrialized countries and low-resource settings."
1206,SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence worldwide: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Objectives: COVID-19 has been arguably the most important public health concern worldwide in 2020, and efforts are now escalating to suppress or eliminate its spread. In this study we undertook a meta-analysis to estimate the global and regional seroprevalence rates in humans of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and to assess whether seroprevalence is associated with geographical, climatic and/or sociodemographic factors. Methods: We systematically reviewed PubMed, Scopus, Embase, medRxiv and bioRxiv databases for preprints or peer-reviewed articles (up to 14 August 2020). Study eligibility criteria were population-based studies describing the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG and/or IgM) serum antibodies. Participants were people from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds (from the general population), whose prior COVID-19 status was unknown and who were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. We used a random-effects model to estimate pooled seroprevalence, and then extrapolated the findings to the global population (for 2020). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses explored potential sources of heterogeneity in the data, and relationships between seroprevalence and sociodemographic, geographical and/or climatic factors. Results: In total, 47 studies involving 399 265 people from 23 countries met the inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity (I2 = 99.4%, p < 0.001) was seen among studies; SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the general population varied from 0.37% to 22.1%, with a pooled estimate of 3.38% (95%CI 3.05-3.72%; 15 879/399 265). On a regional level, seroprevalence varied from 1.45% (0.95-1.94%, South America) to 5.27% (3.97-6.57%, Northern Europe), although some variation appeared to relate to the serological assay used. The findings suggested an association of seroprevalence with income levels, human development indices, geographic latitudes and/or climate. Extrapolating to the 2020 world population, we estimated that 263.5 million individuals had been exposed or infected at the time of this study. Conclusions: This study showed that SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence varied markedly among geographic regions, as might be expected early in a pandemic. Longitudinal surveys to continually monitor seroprevalence around the globe will be critical to support prevention and control efforts, and might indicate levels of endemic stability or instability in particular countries and regions."
1207,SARS-CoV-2 worldwide replication drives rapid rise and selection of mutations across the viral genome: a time-course study - potential challenge for vaccines and therapies.,"Scientists and the public were alarmed at the first large viral variant of SARS-CoV-2 reported in December 2020. We have followed the time course of emerging viral mutants and variants during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in ten countries on four continents. We examined > 383,500 complete SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences in GISAID (Global Initiative of Sharing All Influenza Data) with sampling dates extending until April 05, 2021. These sequences originated from ten different countries: United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, United States, India, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and China. Among the 77 to 100 novel mutations, some previously reported mutations waned and some of them increased in prevalence over time. VUI2012/01 (B.1.1.7) and 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), the so-called UK and South Africa variants, respectively, and two variants from Brazil, 484K.V2, now called P.1 and P.2, increased in prevalence. Despite lockdowns, worldwide active replication in genetically and socio-economically diverse populations facilitated selection of new mutations. The data on mutant and variant SARS-CoV-2 strains provided here comprise a global resource for easy access to the myriad mutations and variants detected to date globally. Rapidly evolving new variant and mutant strains might give rise to escape variants, capable of limiting the efficacy of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostic tests."
1208,Symptoms and Functional Impairment Assessed 8 Months After Mild COVID-19 Among Health Care Workers.,"This cohort study describes COVID-19–related symptoms persisting 8 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection among Swedish health care workers and self-reported effects of the residual symptoms on respondents’ home, work, and social function."
1209,Evaluation of the Aptima transcription-mediated amplification assay (Hologic) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens.,"Background: The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which appeared in late 2019, has been limited by isolating infected individuals. However, identifying such individuals requires accurate diagnostic tools. Objective: This study evaluates the capacity of the Aptima™ Transcription-Mediated Amplification (TMA) assay (Hologic® Panther System) to detect the virus in clinical samples. Study design: We compared the Aptima™ assay to two in-house real-time RT-PCR techniques, one running on the Panther Fusion™ module and the other on the MagNA Pure 96 and Light-Cycler 480 instruments. We included a total of 200 respiratory specimens: 100 tested prospectively and 100 retrospectively (25 -ve/75 +ve). Results: The final Cohen's kappa coefficients were: κ = 0.978 between the Aptima™ and Panther Fusion™ assays, κ = 0.945 between the Aptima™ and MagNA/LC480 assays and κ = 0.956 between the MagNA/LC480 and Panther Fusion™ assays. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the Aptima™ SARS-CoV-2 TMA assay data agree well with those obtained with our routine methods and that this assay can be used to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
