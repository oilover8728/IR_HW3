200,Digital PCR assay for the effective detection of COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 low viral load.,"Objective: Viral nucleic acid detection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the current standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to low viral load in some COVID-19 patients, false negative results from this method have been repeatedly reported. Method: In this study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of digital PCR (dPCR) in simulated samples and clinical samples with qPCR assay through a series of vigorous tests. Results: The results showed that dPCR was more sensitive than qPCR especially for samples with low viral load (≤3 copies). In addition, dPCR had similar specificity as qPCR and could effectively distinguish other human coronaviruses and influenza virus from SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, dPCR was more sensitive than qPCR in detecting the virus in the ""negative"" samples from recurrent COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: In summary, dPCR could serve as a powerful complement to the current qPCR method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, especially for the samples with extremely low viral load, such as recurrent COVID-19 patients."
201,"Mass testing after a single suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in London care homes, April-May 2020: implications for policy and practice.","Introduction: Previous investigations have identified high rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among residents and staff in care homes reporting an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We investigated care homes reporting a single suspected or confirmed case to assess whether early mass testing might reduce risk of transmission during the peak of the pandemic in London. Methods: Between 18 and 27 April 2020, residents and staff in care homes reporting a single case of COVID-19 to Public Health England had a nasal swab to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and subsequent whole-genome sequencing. Residents and staff in two care homes were re-tested 8 days later. Results: Four care homes were investigated. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 20% (65/333) overall, ranging between 3 and 59%. Among residents, positivity ranged between 3 and 76% compared with 3 and 40% in staff. Half of the SARS-CoV-2-positive residents (23/46, 50%) and 63% of staff (12/19) reported symptoms within 14 days before or after testing. Repeat testing 8 days later in two care homes with the highest infection rates identified only two new cases. Genomic analysis demonstrated a small number of introduction of the virus into care homes, and distinct clusters within three of the care homes. Conclusions: We found extensive but variable rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents and staff in care homes reporting a single case of COVID-19. Although routine whole-home testing has now been adopted into practice, care homes must remain vigilant and should be encouraged to report a single suspected case, which should trigger appropriate outbreak control measures."
202,Assessment of the Diagnostic Ability of Four Detection Methods Using Three Sample Types of COVID-19 Patients.,"Background: Viral nucleic acid detection is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, unsuitable sample types and laboratory detection kits/methods lead to misdiagnosis, which delays the prevention and control of the pandemic. Methods: We compared four nucleic acid detection methods [two kinds of reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR A: ORF1ab and N testing; RT-PCRB: only ORF1ab testing), reverse transcription recombinase aided amplification (RT-RAA) and droplet digital RT-PCR (dd-RT-PCR)] using 404 samples of 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including oropharyngeal swab (OPS), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva after deep cough, to evaluate the best sample type and method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results: Among the four methods, dd-RT-PCR exhibited the highest positivity rate (93.0%), followed by RT-PCR B (91.2%) and RT-RAA (91.2%), while the positivity rate of RT-PCR A was only 71.9%. The viral load in OPS [24.90 copies/test (IQR 15.58-129.85)] was significantly lower than that in saliva [292.30 copies/test (IQR 20.20-8628.55)] and NPS [274.40 copies/test (IQR 33.10-2836.45)]. In addition, if OPS samples were tested alone by RT-PCR A, only 21.4% of the COVID-19 patients would be considered positive. The accuracy of all methods reached nearly 100% when saliva and NPS samples from the same patient were tested simultaneously. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection methods should be fully evaluated before use. High-positivity rate methods such as RT-RAA and dd-RT-PCR should be considered when possible. Furthermore, saliva after deep cough and NPS can greatly improve the accuracy of the diagnosis, and testing OPS alone is not recommended."
203,A Highly Automated Mobile Laboratory for On-site Molecular Diagnostics in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Background: Infectious disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic call for rapid response and complete screening of the suspected community population to identify potential carriers of pathogens. Central laboratories rely on time-consuming sample collection methods that are rarely available in resource-limited settings. Methods: We present a highly automated and fully integrated mobile laboratory for fast deployment in response to infectious disease outbreaks. The mobile laboratory was equipped with a 6-axis robot arm for automated oropharyngeal swab specimen collection; virus in the collected specimen was inactivated rapidly using an infrared heating module. Nucleic acid extraction and nested isothermal amplification were performed by a ""sample in, answer out"" laboratory-on-a-chip system, and the result was automatically reported by the onboard information platform. Each module was evaluated using pseudovirus or clinical samples. Results: The mobile laboratory was stand-alone and self-sustaining and capable of on-site specimen collection, inactivation, analysis, and reporting. The automated sampling robot arm achieved sampling efficiency comparable to manual collection. The collected samples were inactivated in as short as 12 min with efficiency comparable to a water bath without damage to nucleic acid integrity. The limit of detection of the integrated microfluidic nucleic acid analyzer reached 150 copies/mL within 45 min. Clinical evaluation of the onboard microfluidic nucleic acid analyzer demonstrated good consistency with reverse transcription quantitative PCR with a κ coefficient of 0.979. Conclusions: The mobile laboratory provides a promising solution for fast deployment of medical diagnostic resources at critical junctions of infectious disease outbreaks and facilitates local containment of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) transmission."
204,"An ultra-portable, self-contained point-of-care nucleic acid amplification test for diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection.","There is currently a high level of demand for rapid COVID-19 tests, that can detect the onset of the disease at point of care settings. We have developed an ultra-portable, self-contained, point-of-care nucleic acid amplification test for diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection, based on the principle of loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The LAMP assay is 100% sensitive and specific to detect a minimum of 300 RNA copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2. All of the required sample transportation, lysing and amplification steps are performed in a standalone disposable cartridge, which is controlled by a battery operated, pocket size (6x9x4cm3) unit. The test is easy to operate and does not require skilled personnel. The total time from sample to answer is approximately 35 min; a colorimetric readout indicates positive or negative results. This portable diagnostic platform has significant potential for rapid and effective testing in community settings. This will accelerate clinical decision making, in terms of effective triage and timely therapeutic and infection control interventions."

206,SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Fecal Sample from a Patient with Typical Findings of COVID-19 Pneumonia on CT but Negative to Multiple SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Tests on Oropharyngeal and Nasopharyngeal Swab Samples.,"Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negative results in the upper respiratory tract represent a major concern for the clinical management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Herein, we report the case of a 43-years-old man with a strong clinical suspicion of COVID-19, who resulted in being negative to multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR tests performed on different oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, despite serology having confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM. The patient underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) that showed typical imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. The presence of viral SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed only by performing a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test on stool. Performing of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test on fecal samples can be a rapid and useful approach to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis in cases where there is an apparent discrepancy between COVID-19 clinical symptoms coupled with chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests' results on samples from the upper respiratory tract."
207,Laboratory diagnosis of novel corona virus (2019-nCoV)-present and the future.,"Background: In December 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, China, and soon became a global health problem. Since its outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 has had a major impact on clinical diagnostic laboratories. The scientific community has quickly risen to the occasion and reports of new developments have arrived at an unprecedented scale. At present, there is a growing list of over 400 SARC-CoV-2 diagnostic tests either in development or approved for clinical use. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing COVID- 19 in microbiology laboratories and also provides an insight into the future diagnostics approaches. Methods: Proper respiratory specimen collected at the appropriate time and from the right anatomical site is critical in the accurate and timely diagnosis of SARSCoV2. While oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs are recommended for the detection of early infection, other lower respiratory tract specimens like the sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage are used for late detection and monitoring of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Results and conclusion: Real-time RT-PCR based molecular assay remains the test of choice for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 while serological tests are being introduced as supplementary tools. Finally, there is an urgent need for scaling up the diagnostic capacity by the introduction of reliable and accurate point-of-care tests which will assist in effective control of this outbreak. These assays can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients."
208,"Biochemical composition, transmission and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization in March 2020 for its continuous and rapid spread worldwide. Rapidly emerging COVID-19 epicenters and mutants of concerns have created mammoth chaos in healthcare sectors across the globe. With over 185 million infections and approximately 4 million deaths globally, COVID-19 continues its unchecked spread despite all mitigation measures. Until effective and affordable antiretroviral drugs are made available and the population at large is vaccinated, timely diagnosis of the infection and adoption of COVID-appropriate behavior remains major tool available to curtail the still escalating COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides an updated overview of various techniques of COVID-19 testing in human samples and also discusses, in brief, the biochemical composition and mode of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Technological advancement in various molecular, serological and immunological techniques including mainly the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), CRISPR, lateral flow assays (LFAs), and immunosensors are reviewed."
209,Molecular Diagnostic Tools for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"The pandemic causing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has globally infected more than 50 million people and ∼1.2 million have succumbed to this deadly pathogen. With the vaccine trials still in clinical phases, mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies primarily on robust virus detection methods and subsequent quarantine measures. Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and encoded proteins. Currently, COVID-19 detection is performed using various molecular platforms as well as serodiagnostics that exhibit approximately 71% sensitivity. These methods encounter several limitations including sensitivity, specificity, availability of skilled expertise and instrument access. Saliva-based COVID-19 diagnostics are emerging as a superior alternative to nasal swabs because of the ease of sample collection, no interaction during sampling, and high viral titers during early stages of infection. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the environment as aerosols associated with suspended particulate matter. Designing virus detection strategies in diverse samples will allow timely monitoring of virus spread in humans and its persistence in the environment. With the passage of time, advanced technologies are overcoming limitations associated with detection. Enhanced sensitivity and specificity of next-generation diagnostics are key features enabling improved prognostic care. In this comprehensive review, we analyze currently adopted advanced technologies and their concurrent use in the development of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 detection."
