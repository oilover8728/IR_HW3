990,Optimizing the diagnostic capacity for COVID-19 PCR testing for low resource and high demand settings: The development of information-dependent pooling protocol.,"Aim: To compare different pooling methods in an attempt to improve the COVID-19 PCR diagnostic capacities. Method: We developed a novel information-dependent pooling protocol (indept), based on transmission of less informative sequential pools on to the next pooling cycle to maximize savings. We then compared it to the halving, generalized halving, splitting and hypercube protocols in a simulation study, across variety of scenarios. Results: All five methods yielded various amount of test savings, which mostly depended on the virus prevalence in the population. In situations of low prevalence (up to 5%), indept had the best performance, requiring on average 20% of tests needed for singular testing across scenarios that were analyzed. Nevertheless, this comes at the expense of speed, with the worst-case scenario of indept protocol requiring up to twice the time needed to test the same number of samples in comparison to the hypercube protocol. In order to offset this, we developed a faster version of the protocol (indeptSp), which minimizes the number of terminal pools and manages to retain savings compared to other protocols, despite marginally longer processing times. Conclusion: The increasing demand for more testing globally can benefit from application of pooling, especially in resource-restrained situations of the low- and middle-income countries or situations of high testing demand. Singular testing in situations of low prevalence should be systematically discouraged."
991,"Comparison of Throat Washings, Nasopharyngeal Swabs and Oropharyngeal Swabs for Detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is detected by reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) from respiratory specimens. This study compares throat washings (TW), nasopharyngeal swabs (NS) and oropharyngeal swabs (OS). A total of 102 samples from 34 adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were analysed by RT-qPCR with absolute quantification. The median concentrations and diagnostic sensitivities were 5.8×104 copies/mL, 85% (NS), 1.4×104, 79% (OS) and 4.3×103, 85% (TW). Concentration differences were significant between NS and TW (P = 0.019). Saliva (SA) was available from 21 patients (median 3.4×103). OS and TW can be considered for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, although with slightly lower concentrations."
992,Low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in plasma of COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department.,"Correct and reliable identification of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 suspected patients is essential for diagnosis. Respiratory samples should always be tested with real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, blood samples have been tested, but without consistent results and therefore the added value of this sample type is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR in blood samples obtained from PCR-proven COVID-19 patients and in addition to elaborate on the potential use of blood for diagnostics. In this single center study, blood samples drawn from patients at the emergency department with proven COVID-19 infection based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in respiratory samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Samples from 118 patients were selected, of which 102 could be included in the study (median age was 65 (IQR 10), 65.7 % men). In six (5.9 %) of the tested samples, SARS-CoV-2 was identified by real-time PCR. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected by real-time PCR in plasma samples from patients with proven COVID-19, but only in a minority of the patients. Plasma should therefore not be used as primary sample in an acute phase setting to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are important to complete the knowledge on possible sample types to test to diagnose COVID-19."
993,A Comparative Study of Real-Time RT-PCR-Based SARS-CoV-2 Detection Methods and Its Application to Human-Derived and Surface Swabbed Material.,"Real-time RT-PCR remains a gold standard in the detection of various viral diseases. In the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, multiple RT-PCR-based tests were developed to screen for viral infection. As an emergency response to increasing testing demand, we established a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR diagnostics platform for which we compared different commercial and in-house RT-PCR protocols. Four commercial, one customized, and one in-house RT-PCR protocols were evaluated with 92 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 92 SARS-CoV-2-negative samples. Furthermore, economical and practical characteristics of these protocols were compared. In addition, a highly sensitive digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) method was developed, and application of RT-PCR and ddPCR methods on SARS-CoV-2 environmental samples was examined. Very low limits of detection (1 or 2 viral copies/μL), high sensitivities (93.6% to 97.8%), and high specificities (98.7% to 100%) for the tested RT-PCR protocols were found. Furthermore, the feasibility of downscaling two of the commercial protocols, which could optimize testing capacity, was demonstrated. Tested commercial and customized RT-PCR detection kits show very good and comparable sensitivity and specificity, and the kits could be further optimized for use on SARS-CoV-2 viral samples derived from human and surface swabbed samples."
994,Longitudinal evaluation of laboratory-based serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.,"Serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection are now widely available for use in diagnostic laboratories. Limited data are available on the performance characteristics in different settings, and at time periods remote from the initial infection. Validation of the Abbott (Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG), DiaSorin (Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG) and Roche (Cobas Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2) assays was undertaken utilising 217 serum samples from 131 participants up to 7 months following COVID-19 infection. The Abbott and DiaSorin assays were implemented into routine laboratory workflow, with outcomes reported for 2764 clinical specimens. Sensitivity and specificity were concordant with the range reported by the manufacturers for all assays. Sensitivity across the convalescent period was highest for the Roche at 95.2-100% (95% CI 81.0-100%), then the DiaSorin at 88.1-100% (95% CI 76.0-100%), followed by the Abbott 68.2-100% (95% CI 53.4-100%). Sensitivity of the Abbott assay fell from approximately 5 months; on this assay paired serum samples for 45 participants showed a significant drop in the signal-to-cut-off ratio and 10 sero-reversion events. When used in clinical practice, all samples testing positive by both DiaSorin and Abbott assays were confirmed as true positive results. In this low prevalence setting, despite high laboratory specificity, the positive predictive value of a single positive assay was low. Comprehensive validation of serological assays is necessary to determine the optimal assay for each diagnostic setting. In this low prevalence setting we found implementation of two assays with different antibody targets maximised sensitivity and specificity, with confirmatory testing necessary for any sample which was positive in only one assay."
995,Evidence of escape of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 from natural and vaccine-induced sera.,"The race to produce vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began when the first sequence was published, and this forms the basis for vaccines currently deployed globally. Independent lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported: UK, B.1.1.7; South Africa, B.1.351; and Brazil, P.1. These variants have multiple changes in the immunodominant spike protein that facilitates viral cell entry via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. Mutations in the receptor recognition site on the spike are of great concern for their potential for immune escape. Here, we describe a structure-function analysis of B.1.351 using a large cohort of convalescent and vaccinee serum samples. The receptor-binding domain mutations provide tighter ACE2 binding and widespread escape from monoclonal antibody neutralization largely driven by E484K, although K417N and N501Y act together against some important antibody classes. In a number of cases, it would appear that convalescent and some vaccine serum offers limited protection against this variant."

997,Lung ultrasound in the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Lung ultrasound has been described for over a decade and international protocols exist for its application. It is a controversial area among pulmonologists and has had more uptake with emergency as well as intensive care physicians. We discuss the basics and evidence behind the use of lung ultrasound in respiratory failure, and what role we see it playing in the current 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic."
998,SARS-CoV-2 detection by extraction-free qRT-PCR for massive and rapid COVID-19 diagnosis during a pandemic in Armenia.,"COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the healthcare and economy on a global scale. It is widely recognized that mass testing is an efficient way to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as aid in the development of informed policies for disease management. However, the current COVID-19 worldwide infection rates increased the demand for rapid and reliable screening of infection. We compared the performance of qRT-PCR in direct heat-inactivated (H), heat-inactivated and pelleted (HC) samples against RNA in a group of 74 subjects (44 positive and 30 negative). Then we compared the sensitivity of HC in a larger group of 196 COVID-19 positive samples. Our study suggests that HC samples show higher accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection PCR assay compared to direct H (89 % vs 83 % of the detection in RNA). The sensitivity of detection using direct samples varied depending on the sample transport and storage media as well as the viral loads (as measured by qRT-PCR Ct levels). Altogether, all the data suggest that purified RNA provides more accurate results, however, direct sample testing with qRT-PCR may help to significantly increase testing capacity. Switching to the direct sample testing is justified if the number of tests is doubled at least."
999,Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of upper respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients by virus isolation using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.,"Background: An outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-associated respiratory infectious diseases (COVID-19) emerged in 2019 and has spread rapidly in humans around the world. The demonstration of in vitro infectiousness of respiratory specimens is an informative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 transmission from patients with COVID-19; accordingly, viral isolation assays in cell culture are an important aspect of laboratory diagnostics for COVID-19. Methods: We developed a simple and rapid protocol for isolating SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory specimens using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, a cell line that is highly susceptible to the virus. We also investigated a correlation between isolation of SARS-CoV-2 and viral load detected by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using N2 primer/probe set that has been developed for testing of COVID-19 in Japan. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 isolation protocol did not require blind passage of inoculated cells and yielded the results of viral isolation within 7 days after inoculation. Specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) values of <20.2, determined by rRT-PCR, were predicted to be isolation-positive. On the other hand, 6.9% of specimens with Ct values >35 were virus isolation-positive, indicating that low viral loads (high Ct values) in upper respiratory specimens do not always indicate no risk of containing transmissible virus. Conclusion: In combination with rRT-PCR, the SARS-CoV-2 isolation protocol provides a means for assessing the potential risk of transmissible virus in upper respiratory specimens."
