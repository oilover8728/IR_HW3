9020,Feasibility of using point-of-care lung ultrasound for early triage of COVID-19 patients in the emergency room.,"Purpose: Diagnostic value of point-of-care lung ultrasound (POCUS) in detection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in an emergency setting is currently unclear. In this study, we aimed to compare diagnostic performance, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy, of POCUS lung, chest CT, and RT-PCR for clinically suspected COVID-19 infections in patients submitting to the emergency room (ER). Material and methods: This retrospective study enrolled 93 patients with a suspected COVID-19 infection, admitted to the ER between March 28th and April 20th, 2020. Test subjects showed one or more symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, for which consequent COVID-19 testing was achieved using POCUS lung, chest CT, and RT-PCR. CT images were analyzed by 2 radiologists blinded to RT-PCR results. POCUS lung was performed by three emergency medical doctors, and reports were analyzed by the researcher, blinded to clinical information, US imaging, CT, and RT-PCR test results. Results: Compared with RT-PCR, POCUS lung demonstrated outstanding sensitivity and NPV (93.3% and 94.1% respectively) while showing poor values for specificity, PPV, and accuracy (21.3%, 19.2%, and 33.3% respectively). In contrast, similar inquiries using chest CT as index test, excellent sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and accuracy (80.0%, 86.7%, 95.6%, and 85.6%, respectively) were reported, beside a moderate value for PPV (54.5%). Conclusion: POCUS may provide early ER triage with a useful, rapid, low-threshold, and safe screening tool in evaluating possible COVID-19 infections. Due to limited specificity, suggestive POCUS lung findings should be confirmed with RT-PCR or chest CT."
9021,"An update on COVID-19 pandemic: the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention and treatment strategies.","Introduction: To date, the transmission of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is still uncontrollable with the fact that the numbers of confirmed and death cases are still increasing. Up to 1st October 2020, 33,842,281 confirmed cases and 1,010,634 confirmed deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization from 216 different countries, areas and territories. Despite the urgent demand for effective treatment strategies, there is still no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and the treatment guidelines for COVID-19 vary between countries. Area covered: In this article, we summarized the current knowledge on COVID-19 and the pandemic worldwide. Moreover, the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention and different treatment options will be discussed so that we shall prepare ourselves better to fight with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Expert opinion: The situation of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unpredictable. There is no effective vaccine or specific anti-viral drug to treat serve COVID-19 patients. Combination therapies have shown promising clinical improvement. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs might be one of possible treatment options. Without specific treatment and vaccines for COVID-19, the most effective way to prevent from being infected is to generate an ecosystem with effective protection, precautions and preventive measures."
9022,Effect of different human tissue processing techniques on SARS-CoV-2 inactivation-review.,"The safety of the tissue transplant recipient is a top priority for tissue banks, and the emergence of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has raised significant concerns about the risks of releasing tissue for clinical use. In the present study, we conducted a literature review about the potential infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in different biological tissues and the influence of various tissue processing and sterilization procedures on viral inactivation. The search revealed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor to penetrate human cells. These receptors are present in skin cells, musculoskeletal tissue, amniotic membranes, cardiovascular tissue and ocular tissues, including the cornea. In general, we found that coronaviruses are stable at low temperatures, and inactivated upon exposure to extreme heat and pH. Notably, gamma irradiation, which has already been employed to inactivate SARS and MERS, could be useful for sterilizing skin, amnion and musculoskeletal tissues against SARS-CoV-2. We conclude that due to the limited information about the effects of physical and chemical tissue processing methods on viral neutralization, rigorous donor screening is still essential for tissue transplant recipient safety."
9023,COVID-19: Does the infectious inoculum dose-response relationship contribute to understanding heterogeneity in disease severity and transmission dynamics?,"The variation in the speed and intensity of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and severity of the resulting COVID-19 disease are still imperfectly understood. We postulate a dose-response relationship in COVID-19, and that ""the dose of virus in the initial inoculum"" is an important missing link in understanding several incompletely explained observations in COVID-19 as a factor in transmission dynamics and severity of disease. We hypothesize that: (1) Viral dose in inoculum is related to severity of disease, (2) Severity of disease is related to transmission potential, and (3) In certain contexts, chains of severe cases can build up to severe local outbreaks, and large-scale intensive epidemics. Considerable evidence from other infectious diseases substantiates this hypothesis and recent evidence from COVID-19 points in the same direction. We suggest research avenues to validate the hypothesis. If proven, our hypothesis could strengthen the scientific basis for deciding priority containment measures in various contexts in particular the importance of avoiding super-spreading events and the benefits of mass masking."
9024,"The COVID-19 and Influenza ""Twindemic"": Barriers to Influenza Vaccination and Potential Acceptance of SARS-CoV2 Vaccination in African Americans.","Influenza is a contagious respiratory virus that causes a significant annual health burden in the United States (US). In spite of effective yearly vaccinations to protect individuals against influenza-related health complications, especially with certain chronic co-morbid illnesses, persistent racial/ethnic disparities exist in influenza immunization. African Americans continue to experience low vaccination uptake, stemming, at least in part, from years of bias in and mistrust of orthodox medicine, safety concerns, and environmental barriers to vaccine access. The novel respiratory coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, causes COVID-19, leading to a pandemic that in the U.S. has exerted severe physical, psychological, and economic tolls on the African Americans and other disadvantaged communities. These two respiratory-borne virus' cause disparate effects in the black community, unmasking persistent disparities in healthcare. Unfortunately, suboptimal influenza immunization acceptance exacerbates flu-related adverse health outcomes, similar to difficulties from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In consideration of the impending influenza-COVID-19 ""twindemic"", robust educational campaigns, policy initiatives, and novel approaches to influenza immunization must be considered for the African American community to build trust in the health benefits of the influenza vaccination and, ultimately, to trust in the health benefits of potential SARS-CoV2 vaccines, when available for the general public."
9025,Zinc and SARS-CoV-2: A molecular modeling study of Zn interactions with RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and 3C-like proteinase enzymes.,"RNA‑dependent RNA‑polymerase (RdRp) and 3C‑like proteinase (3CLpro) are two main enzymes that play a key role in the replication of SARS‑CoV‑2. Zinc (Zn) has strong immunogenic properties and is known to bind to a number of proteins, modulating their activities. Zn also has a history of use in viral infection control. Thus, the present study models potential Zn binding to RdRp and the 3CLpro. Through molecular modeling, the Zn binding sites in the aforementioned two important enzymes of viral replication were found to be conserved between severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‑coronavirus (CoV) and SARS‑CoV‑2. The location of these sites may influence the enzymatic activity of 3CLpro and RdRp in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Since Zn has established immune health benefits, is readily available, non‑expensive and a safe food supplement, with the comparisons presented here between SARS‑CoV and COVID‑19, the present study proposes that Zn could help ameliorate the disease process of COVID‑19 infection."
9026,COVID-19 and immunity: quo vadis?,"Understanding the precise nature and durability of protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential in order to gain insight into the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to develop novel treatment strategies to this disease. Here, I succinctly summarize what is currently known and unknown about the immune response during COVID-19 and discuss whether natural infections can lead to herd immunity."
9027,Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 That Recovered from Respiratory Failure by Treatment That Included High-dose Intravenous Immunoglobulin.,"We herein report a case of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in which high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment achieved significant clinical improvement of deterioration of pulmonary inflammation after temporary clinical improvement. In the present case, clinical and radiological deterioration occurred despite a decrease in viral load, suggesting that deterioration was caused by reactivation of proinflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, rather than direct viral effects. IVIg treatment may provide not only immunosuppressive effects but also inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, indicating that treatment including IVIg may be effective by inhibiting cytokine storm in severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection."
9028,Collateral damage caused by COVID-19: Change in volume and spectrum of neurosurgery patients.,"Background: There has been a dramatic change in the pattern of patients being seen in hospitals and surgeries performed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study is to study the change in the volume and spectrum of surgeries performed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19 era. Methods: Details of all patients who were operated under department of neurosurgery at our institute since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in India were collected and compared to the same time period last year. The demographic profile, diagnosis, surgery performed, type of surgery (routine/emergency, cranial/spinal and major/minor) in these two groups were compared. They were further categorized into various categories [neuro-oncology (brain and spine tumors), neuro-trauma (head injury and spinal trauma), congenital cases, degenerative spine, neuro-vascular, CSF diversion procedures, etc.] and compared between the two groups. Results: Our study showed a drastic fall (52.2%) in the number of surgeries performed during the pandemic compared to pre-COVID era. 11.3% of patients operated during COVID-19 pandemic were non-emergent surgeries compared to 57.7% earlier (p = 0.000). There was increase in proportion of minor cases from 28.8% to 41.5% (p = 0.106). The proportion of spinal cases decreased from 27.9% to 11.3% during the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.043). Conclusions: The drastic decrease in the number of surgeries performed will result in large backlog of patients waiting for 'elective' surgery. There is a risk of these patients presenting at a later stage with progressed disease and the best way forward would be to resume work with necessary precautions and universal effective COVID-19 testing."
9029,The Evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 during Pandemic and Adaptation to the Host.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 is a zoonotic virus with a possible origin in bats and potential transmission to humans through an intermediate host. When zoonotic viruses jump to a new host, they undergo both mutational and natural selective pressures that result in non-synonymous and synonymous adaptive changes, necessary for efficient replication and rapid spread of diseases in new host species. The nucleotide composition and codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 indicate the presence of a highly conserved, gene-specific codon usage bias. The codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is mostly antagonistic to human and bat codon usage. SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias is mainly shaped by the natural selection, while mutational pressure plays a minor role. The time-series analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates that the virus is slowly evolving. Virus isolates from later stages of the outbreak have more biased codon usage and nucleotide composition than virus isolates from early stages of the outbreak."
