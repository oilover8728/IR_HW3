460,Real-time SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and variants tracking over multiple candidates using nanopore DNA sequencing.,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is accountable for a major pandemic situation. The emergence of the B.1.1.7 strain, as a highly transmissible variant has accelerated the world-wide interest in tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants' occurrence. Similarly, other extremely infectious variants, were described and further others are expected to be discovered due to the long period of time on which the pandemic situation is lasting. All described SARS-CoV-2 variants present several mutations within the gene encoding the Spike protein, involved in host receptor recognition and entry into the cell. Hence, instead of sequencing the whole viral genome for variants' tracking, herein we propose to focus on the SPIKE region to increase the number of candidate samples to screen at once; an essential aspect to accelerate diagnostics, but also variants' emergence/progression surveillance. This proof of concept study accomplishes both at once, population-scale diagnostics and variants' tracking. This strategy relies on (1) the use of the portable MinION DNA sequencer; (2) a DNA barcoding and a SPIKE gene-centered variant's tracking, increasing the number of candidates per assay; and (3) a real-time diagnostics and variant's tracking monitoring thanks to our software RETIVAD. This strategy represents an optimal solution for addressing the current needs on SARS-CoV-2 progression surveillance, notably due to its affordable implementation, allowing its implantation even in remote places over the world."

463,Implementation of an efficient SARS-CoV-2 specimen pooling strategy for high throughput diagnostic testing.,"The rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals remains a key strategy for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Frequent testing of populations to detect infection early in asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals can be a powerful tool for intercepting transmission, especially when the viral prevalence is low. However, RT-PCR testing-the gold standard of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis-is expensive, making regular testing of every individual unfeasible. Sample pooling is one approach to lowering costs. By combining samples and testing them in groups the number of tests required is reduced, substantially lowering costs. Here we report on the implementation of pooling strategies using 3-d and 4-d hypercubes to test a professional sports team in South Africa. We have shown that infected samples can be reliably detected in groups of 27 and 81, with minimal loss of assay sensitivity for samples with individual Ct values of up to 32. We report on the automation of sample pooling, using a liquid-handling robot and an automated web interface to identify positive samples. We conclude that hypercube pooling allows for the reliable RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, at significantly lower costs than lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests."
464,Emulsion-based isothermal nucleic acid amplification for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection via angle-dependent light scatter analysis.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an ongoing global health crisis, has revealed the need for new technologies that integrate the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR tests with a faster time-to-detection. Here, an emulsion loop-mediated isothermal amplification (eLAMP) platform was developed to allow for the compartmentalization of LAMP reactions, leading to faster changes in emulsion characteristics, and thus lowering time-to-detection. Within these droplets, ongoing LAMP reactions lead to adsorption of amplicons to the water-oil interface, causing a decrease in interfacial tension, resulting in smaller emulsion diameters. Changes in emulsion diameter allow for the monitoring of the reaction by use of angle-dependent light scatter (based off Mie scatter theory). Mie scatter simulations confirmed that light scatter intensity is diameter-dependent and smaller colloids have lower intensity values compared to larger colloids. Via spectrophotometers and fiber optic cables placed at 30° and 60°, light scatter intensity was monitored. Scatter intensities collected at 5 min, 30° could statistically differentiate 10, 103, and 105 copies/μL initial concentrations compared to NTC. Similarly, 5 min scatter intensities collected at 60° could statistically differentiate 105 copies/μL initial concentrations in comparison to NTC. The use of both angles during the eLAMP assay allows for distinction between high and low initial target concentrations. The efficacy of a smartphone-based platform was also tested and had a similar limit of detection and assay time of less than 10 min. Furthermore, fluorescence-labeled primers were used to validate target nucleic acid amplification. Compared to existing LAMP assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection, these times-to-detections are very rapid."
465,Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients attending an acute hospital ambulatory assessment unit.,"To describe the factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in mild-to-moderate patients attending for assessment. This observational study was conducted in a Model 4 tertiary referral center in Ireland. All patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 assessment over a 4-week period were included. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, medications, and outcomes (including length of stay, discharge, and mortality) were collected. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients were assessed. These patients were predominantly female (62%) with a median age of 50 years (SD 16.9). Nineteen (6.8%) patients had SARS-CoV-2 detected. Dysgeusia was associated with a 16-fold increased prediction of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (p = .001; OR, 16.8; 95% CI, 3.82-73.84). Thirteen patients with SARS-COV-2 detected (68.4%) were admitted, in contrast with 38.1% (99/260) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 non-detectable or not tested (p = .001). Female patients were more likely to be hospitalized (p = .01) as were current and ex-smokers (p = .05). We describe olfactory disturbance and fever as the main presenting features in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These patients are more likely to be hospitalized with increased length of stay; however, they make up a minority of the patients assessed. ""Non-detectable"" patients remain likely to require prolonged hospitalization. Knowledge of predictors of hospitalization in a ""non-detectable"" cohort will aid future planning and discussion of patient assessment in a SARS-CoV-2 era."
466,"Simple, Inexpensive RNA Isolation and One-Step RT-qPCR Methods for SARS-CoV-2 Detection and General Use.","The most common method for RNA detection involves reverse transcription followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Commercial one-step master mixes-which include both a reverse transcriptase and a thermostable polymerase and thus allow performing both the RT and qPCR steps consecutively in a sealed well-are key reagents for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing; yet, these are typically expensive and have been affected by supply shortages in periods of high demand. As an alternative, we describe here how to express and purify Taq polymerase and M-MLV reverse transcriptase and assemble a homemade one-step RT-qPCR master mix. This mix can be easily assembled from scratch in any laboratory equipped for protein purification. We also describe two simple alternative methods to prepare clinical swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-qPCR: heat-inactivation for direct addition, and concentration of RNA by isopropanol precipitation. Finally, we describe how to perform RT-qPCR using the homemade master mix, how to prepare in vitro-transcribed RNA standards, and how to use a fluorescence imager for endpoint detection of RT-PCR amplification in the absence of a qPCR machine In addition to being useful for diagnostics, these versatile protocols may be adapted for nucleic acid quantification in basic research. © 2021 The Authors.

467,A high-throughput microfluidic nanoimmunoassay for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or ultralow-volume blood samples.,"Novel technologies are needed to facilitate large-scale detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies in human blood samples. Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence studies and vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a microfluidic nanoimmunoassay (NIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1,024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultralow-volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 μL of whole blood easily obtainable from a simple finger prick. The NIA platform achieves high throughput, high sensitivity, and specificity based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples, and negligible reagent consumption. We furthermore demonstrate the possibility to combine NIA with decentralized and simple approaches to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be applicable to current and future SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker analysis in general."
468,"A simple, safe and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation and RNA extraction for RT-qPCR.","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent need for diagnostic tests to detect viral RNA. Commercial RNA extraction kits are often expensive, in limited supply, and do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for SARS-CoV-2 extraction that utilize readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We optimized and simplified a RNA extraction method combining a high molar acidic guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) solution, phenol and chloroform. First, we determined the GITC/RNA dilution thresholds compatible with an efficient two-step RT-qPCR for B2M mRNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples. Second, we optimized a one-step RT-qPCR against SARS-CoV-2 using NP and OP samples. We furthermore tested a SARS-CoV-2 dilution series to determine the detection threshold. The method enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). The protocol is simple, safe, and expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method takes about 30 min from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA and circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits."
469,A Prospective Evaluation of the Analytical Performance of GENECUBE() HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE() FLU A/B.,"Background: Molecular tests are the mainstay of detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, their accessibility can be limited by the long examination time and inability to evaluate multiple samples at once. Objective: This study evaluated the analytical performance of the newly developed rapid molecular assays GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE® FLU A/B. Method: This prospective study was conducted between 14 December 2020 and 9 January 2021 at a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) center. Samples were collected from the nasopharynx with flocked swabs. Molecular tests were performed with the GENECUBE® system and reference reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and the results of the two assays were compared. Result: Among 1065 samples, 81 (7.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the reference RT-PCR. Three showed discordance between GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the reference RT-PCR; the total, positive, and negative samples of concordance for the two assays were 99.7%, 100%, and 99.7%, respectively. All discordant cases were positive with GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and negative with the reference RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all three samples using another molecular assay for SARS-CoV-2. For GENECUBE® FLU A/B, the total, positive, and negative samples of concordance for the two assays were 99.5%, 100%, and 99.1%. Conclusion: The GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE® FLU A/B demonstrated sufficient analytical performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus A/B."
