9680,Interactomes of SARS-CoV-2 and human coronaviruses reveal host factors potentially affecting pathogenesis.,"Host-virus protein-protein interactions play key roles in the life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We conducted a comprehensive interactome study between the virus and host cells using tandem affinity purification and proximity-labeling strategies and identified 437 human proteins as the high-confidence interacting proteins. Further characterization of these interactions and comparison to other large-scale study of cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection elucidated how distinct SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins participate in its life cycle. With these data mining, we discovered potential drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19. The interactomes of two key SARS-CoV-2-encoded viral proteins, NSP1 and N, were compared with the interactomes of their counterparts in other human coronaviruses. These comparisons not only revealed common host pathways these viruses manipulate for their survival, but also showed divergent protein-protein interactions that may explain differences in disease pathology. This comprehensive interactome of SARS-CoV-2 provides valuable resources for the understanding and treating of this disease."
9681,Pancreatic injury in the course of coronavirus disease 2019: A not-so-rare occurrence.,"Despite respiratory symptoms are typically found during the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), gastrointestinal manifestations are increasingly described. However, data regarding COVID‐19‐associated pancreatic injury are still limited, as well as the mechanisms underlying COVID‐19 induced‐pancreatic damage have not been completely clarified. Herein, we described pancreatic abnormalities in six (8.5%) out of 70 patients with COVID‐19 hospitalized in our unit from February 25, 2020 to May 10, 2020. We hypothesized that pancreatic damage may be associated with several factors including direct effect of SARS‐CoV‐2, inflammatory cascade, dehydration and multiple organ dysfunction.

9682,The impact of COVID-19 on neglected parasitic diseases: what to expect?,"Here we highlight coinfections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with ectoparasites, helminths, and protozoa, described in the literature, and the urgent need to understand the conditions of these associated pathologies. We emphasize the notion that such information is crucial for the continuity of measures that have been used for decades to control neglected parasitic diseases."
9683,[Follow-up testing of viral nucleic acid in discharged patients with moderate type of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)].,"Objective: To investigate the clinical outcome of patients with moderate type of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after discharge by retesting viral nucleic acid. Methods: Seven patients with moderate COVID-19 met the discharge criteria enacted by National Health Commission were quarantine in hospital for 7 days, then continuously quarantined at home for 4 weeks after discharged. During the three weeks of quarantined period, the symptoms and signs were documented; and sputum or nasal swab and feces samples were collected to test SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid by RT-PCR method. Results: There were no symptoms and signs during the quarantine period in all 7 patients. However, respiratory swabs from 3 patients were confirmed positive of SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid at 5 to 7 days after they met the discharge criteria. Conclusions: The study indicates that there is a relatively high incidence of positive viral nucleic acid in patients met the discharge criteria, and it is suggested that patients met the current discharge criteria should be quarantined in hospital for another 7 days and the follow-up viral testing is necessary."

9688,"Dose-response Relation Deduced for Coronaviruses From Coronavirus Disease 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: Meta-analysis Results and its Application for Infection Risk Assessment of Aerosol Transmission.","Background: A comprehensive understanding of the transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great importance to effectively control the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the fundamental dose-response relation is missing for evaluation of the infection risk. Methods: We developed a simple framework to integrate the a priori dose-response relation for SARS-CoV-2 based on mice experiments, the recent data on infection risk from a meta-analysis, and respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath to shed light on the dose-response relation for humans. The aerosol transmission infection risk was evaluated based on the dose-response model for a typical indoor environment. Results: The developed dose-response relation is an exponential function with a constant k in the range of about 6.4 × 104 to 9.8 × 105 virus copies, which means that the infection risk caused by 1 virus copy in viral shedding is on the order of 10-6 to 10-5. The median infection risk via aerosol transmission with 1-hour exposure (10-6 to 10-4) was significantly lower than the risk caused by close contact (10-1) in a room with an area of 10 to 400 m2 with 1 infected individual in it and with a typical ventilation rate of 1 air change per hour. Conclusions: The infection risk caused by aerosol transmission was significantly lower than the risk caused by close contact. It is still necessary to be cautious for the potential aerosol transmission risk in small rooms with prolonged exposure duration."
9689,The Production of Standardized Samples with Known Concentrations for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 RT-qPCR Testing Validation for Developing Countries in the Period of the Pandemic Era.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic of pneumonia spreading around the world, leading to serious threats to public health and attracting enormous attention. There is an urgent need for sensitive diagnostic testing implementation to control and manage SARS-CoV-2 in public health laboratories. The quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay is the gold standard method, but the sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 testing are dependent on a number of factors. Methods: We synthesized RNA based on the genes published to estimate the concentration of inactivated virus samples in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. The limit of detection (LOD), linearity, accuracy, and precision were evaluated according to the bioanalytical method validation guidelines. Results: We found that the LOD reached around 3 copies/reaction. Furthermore, intra-assay precision, accuracy, and linearity met the accepted criterion with an RSD for copies of less than 25%, and linear regression met the accepted R 2 of 0.98. Conclusions: We suggest that synthesized RNA based on the database of the NCBI gene bank for estimating the concentration of inactivated virus samples provides a potential opportunity for reliable testing to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as limit the spread of the disease. This method may be relatively quick and inexpensive, and it may be useful for developing countries during the pandemic era. In the long term, it is also applicable for evaluation, verification, validation, and external quality assessment."
