2080,Analytical performances of five SARS-CoV-2 whole-blood finger-stick IgG-IgM combined antibody rapid tests.,"Facing the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for serological assays identifying individuals previously infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). We herein compared five new CE-IVD-labeled commercially available SARS-CoV-2 whole-blood finger-stick IgG/IgM combined RDTs, in parallel according to the manufacturers' instructions, with two serum panels obtained from 48 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (panel I) and from a group of 52 patients randomly selected, for whom serum samples collected before the COVID-19 epidemic (from October 1 to November 30, 2019) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (panel II). We found a sensitivity of 95.8 %, 91.6 %, 92.3 %, 97.9 % and 91.4 %, and a specificity of 98.1 %, 86.5 %, 100 %, 98.1 % and 84.6 %, for BIOSYNEX COVID-19 BSS (IgG/IgM) (Biosynex Swiss SA, Freiburg, Switzerland), Humasis COVID-19 IgG/IgM Test (Humasis Co., Ltd., Gyneonggi, Republic of Korea), LYHER COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test (Medakit Ltd, Hong Kong, China), SIENNAâ„¢ COVID-19 (IgG/IgM) Rapid Test Cassette (Salofa Oy, Salo, Finland) and NG-BIOTECH COVID-19 (IgG/IgM) (NG-Biotech, Guipry, France), respectively. Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM combined RDTs have a sufficient sensitivity for identifying individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infection, but some RDTs may lack of specificity, with risk of false positivity mainly for the IgM band."
2081,Immunotherapy for COVID-19: Evolving treatment of viral infection and associated adverse immunological reactions.,"This review on COVID-19 immunotherapy enables a comparative analysis of the short-list of currently approved major vaccines. These include the Pfizer and Moderna first mRNA vaccines under FDA purview and the Oxford/AstraZeneca simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine (under UK-MHPRA guidance), all produced in record time, being safe and effective. The Pfizer and Moderna double dose vaccines have the clear edge in treatment efficacy, being in the 90% range compared to AstraZeneca in the average 70%. However, the AZ double dose vaccine has significant advantages with respect to lower cost and stability in storage. We enumerate several potential advances in the technology of the manufacturers: (1) combination vaccines such as testing AstraZeneca's product with a component of the Russian's Sputnik V to achieve durable immunity; (2) the potential for single dose vaccines coming on-line, and with Johnson & Johnson/Janssen; and (3) the need for refined thermotolerant formulations obviating the need for cold storage. As an adjunct to vaccinotherapy, affinity adsorption column technology is another facet recruited in the processing of corona convalescent plasma/cryosupernatant to concentrate neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Clinical trials, to date, of infected patients have been indeterminate as to whether plasmapheresis-based products are effective or not. This is due to the failure to standardize the composition of the plasma derived component, ambiguous clinical indications for use in human subjects, and inconsistent timing of administration in the course of the infection. Known T-cell lymphopenia, which is attendant to progressive viral infection and immune driven inflammation, may be a quantitative surrogate biological marker as to when to start treatment. This is not only for initiating plasmapheresis-based therapeutics but also the judicious selection of ancillary pharmaceuticals, ie. monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins and anti-viral drugs."
2082,Elucidating reasons of COVID-19 re-infection and its management strategies.,"Background and aims: Reinfection is gradually being recognised after symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. We try to elucidate various explanations behind COVID-19 reinfection and suggest possible strategies to counteract this threat. Methods: We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as 'COVID-19', 'Pandemics', 'Reinfection', 'Vaccines' and 'India' on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in March 2021 and first half of April 2021 during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiology, risk factors and trends of reinfection were assessed. Results: A multitude of factors have been associated with rising incidence of COVID-19 reinfection in India and across the world. Emergence of 'Variants of Concern (VOC)', pandemic fatigue and disregard of infection prevention strategies appear to be the most obvious reasons. Conclusions: COVID-19 reinfection is an emerging concern amongst the worldwide population with newer mutant strains demonstrating increasing transmissibility and responsible for continuing waves of the pandemic. COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB), improvised vaccines and enhanced vaccination drives are necessary to mitigate global threat."

2085,Disparities in Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin Antibodies in a Large Midwestern Health Care System.,"Objectives: Increased exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a result of having an essential job is compounded by factors such as age, race, and ethnicity. We used a cross-sectional study design to describe disparities in the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) test results by demographic characteristics and clinical roles among a cohort of health care workers employed by the largest Midwestern health care system in the United States. Methods: We collected 16 233 SARS-CoV-2 IgG serum samples from June 8 through July 10, 2020, from a convenience sample of Illinois- and Wisconsin-based adult health care workers. The research team, in collaboration with ACL Laboratories, used a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Study data included SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay results and demographic characteristics of workers (age, sex, race, ethnicity, clinical role, zip code). We generated crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) to describe disparities in seroprevalence distribution among demographic and social factors. Results: Of 16 233 IgG serum samples tested, 622 (3.8%) test results were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found significant disparities in SARS-CoV-2 positivity by age, race, ethnicity, and clinical role. Participants aged 32-82 had lower adjusted ORs (aORs) of positive IgG than participants aged 18-31 (aOR range, 0.54-0.66). Odds of positivity were higher among Black (aOR = 3.86), Asian (aOR = 1.42), and mixed-race (aOR = 1.99) workers than among White workers; among Hispanic workers (aOR = 1.80) than among non-Hispanic workers; and among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical workers (aOR = 1.86) than among nonclinical workers. Conclusions: Public health efforts should focus on increasing COVID-19 safety messaging, testing, vaccination, and other prevention efforts for people who are young, non-White, Hispanic, and working in COVID-19-clinical units."
2086,Admission COVID-19 clinical risk assessment for guiding patient placement and diagnostic testing strategy.,"Introduction: Without universal access to point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 testing, many hospitals rely on clinical judgement alone for identifying cases of COVID-19 early. Methods: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust introduced a 'traffic light' clinical judgement aid to the COVID-19 admissions unit in mid-March 2020. Ability to accurately predict COVID-19 was audited retrospectively across different stages of the epidemic. Results: One SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patient (1/41, 2%) was misallocated to a 'green' (non-COVID-19) area during the first period of observation, and no patients (0/32, 0%) were mislabelled 'green' during the second period. 33 of 62 (53%) labelled 'red' (high risk) tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive during the first period, while 5 of 22 (23%) 'red' patients were PCR positive in the second. Conclusion: COVID-19 clinical risk stratification on initial assessment effectively identifies non-COVID-19 patients. However, diagnosing COVID-19 is challenging and risk of overcalling COVID-19 should be recognised, especially when background prevalence is low."
2087,Interest of the cellular population data analysis as an aid in the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a high contagiousness requiring isolation measures. At this time, diagnosis is based on the positivity of specific RT-PCR and/or chest computed tomography scan, which are time-consuming and may delay diagnosis. Complete blood count (CBC) can potentially contribute to the diagnosis of COVID-19. We studied whether the analysis of cellular population data (CPD), provided as part of CBC-Diff analysis by the DxH 800 analyzers (Beckman Coulter), can help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Cellular population data of the different leukocyte subpopulations were analyzed in 137 controls, 322 patients with proven COVID-19 (COVID+), and 285 patients for whom investigations were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-). When CPD of COVID+ were different from controls and COVID- patients, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to test the discriminating capacity of the individual parameters. Using a random forest classifier, we developed the algorithm based on the combination of 4 monocyte CPD to discriminate COVID+ from COVID- patients. This algorithm was tested prospectively in a series of 222 patients referred to the emergency unit. Results: Among the 222 patients, 86 were diagnosed as COVID-19 and 60.5% were correctly identified using the discriminating protocol. Among the 136 COVID- patients, 10.3% were misclassified (specificity 89.7%, sensitivity 60.5%). False negatives were observed mainly in patients with a low inflammatory state whereas false positives were mainly seen in patients with sepsis. Conclusion: Consideration of CPD could constitute a first step and potentially aid in the early diagnosis of COVID-19."
2088,Presence of viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab specimens of COVID-19 patients.,"Purpose: To detect the presence of viral RNA of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in conjunctival swab specimens of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: Forty-five COVID-19 patients positive for real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab with or without ocular manifestations were included in the study. The conjunctival swab of each patient was collected by an ophthalmologist posted for COVID duty. Results: Out of 45 patients, 35 (77.77%) were males and the rest were females. The mean age was 31.26 Â± 12.81 years. None of the patients had any ocular manifestations. One (2.23%) out of 45 patients was positive for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival swab. Conclusion: This study shows that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in conjunctival swabs of confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients. Though the positivity rate of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swabs is very less, care should be exercised during the ocular examination of patients of COVID-19."
