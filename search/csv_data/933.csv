9320,"Proactive Engagement of the Expert Meeting in Managing the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Epidemic, Japan, February-June 2020.","To deal with the risk of emerging diseases with many unknowns, close and timely collaboration and communication between science experts and policymakers are crucial to developing and implementing an effective science-based intervention strategy. The Expert Meeting, an ad hoc medical advisory body, was established in February 2020 to advise Japan's COVID-19 Response Headquarters. The group played an important role in the policymaking process, promoting timely situation awareness and developing science-based proposals on interventions that were promptly reflected in government actions. However, this expert group may have been overly proactive in taking on the government's role in crisis management. For the next stage of managing the coronavirus disease pandemic and future pandemics, the respective roles of the government and its advisory bodies need to be clearly defined. Leadership and strategic risk communication by the government are key."
9321,New perspective towards therapeutic regimen against SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The ongoing enormous loss of human life owing to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global crisis ranging from the collapse of health - care systems to socio-economic instability. As SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, very little information is available from researchers and therefore, a rigorous effort is required to decode its pathogenicity. There are no licenced treatment options available for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections and the development of a new antiviral drug targeting coronavirus cannot happen soon. Consequently, drug repurposing is a promising solution for combating the present pandemic. In this review, we have thoroughly discussed all the proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome; their importance in pathogenicity and their potential role in drug discovery. Also, the budding threat of co-infections by other pathogenic microbes has been highlighted. Furthermore, the advances made in the medicinal field for the treatment and prevention of this viral infection is explained. Altogether, this review will provide some insightful discussions about this infectious disease and will meet certain of the knowledge gaps which exist by presenting an exhaustive and extensive scientific report on the ongoing mission for COVID-19 drug discovery."

9323,Computational Insight Into the Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Membrane Fusion.,"Membrane fusion, a key step in the early stages of virus propagation, allows the release of the viral genome in the host cell cytoplasm. The process is initiated by fusion peptides that are small, hydrophobic components of viral membrane-embedded glycoproteins and are typically conserved within virus families. Here, we attempted to identify the correct fusion peptide region in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of dual membrane systems with varied oligomeric units of putative candidate peptides. Of all of the systems tested, only a trimeric unit of a 40-amino-acid region (residues 816-855 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike) was effective in triggering the initial stages of membrane fusion, within 200 ns of simulation time. Association of this trimeric unit with dual membranes resulted in the migration of lipids from the upper leaflet of the lower bilayer toward the lower leaflet of the upper bilayer to create a structural unit reminiscent of a fusion bridge. We submit that residues 816-855 of Spike represent the bona fide fusion peptide of SARS-CoV-2 and that computational methods represent an effective way to identify fusion peptides in viral glycoproteins."
9324,"Prolonged viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in two immunocompromised patients, a case report.","Background: The duration of viable Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding in immunocompromised patients is still unknown. This case report describes the duration of viable SARS-CoV-2 in two immunocompromised patients with completely different clinical courses and further addresses the immunological aspects. Case presentations: Oropharyngeal swaps were collected continuously during hospitalization for two immunocompromised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and sent for analysis to real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral culture assessed by plaque assay and full genome sequencing. Blood samples for flow cytometry and further immunological analysis were taken once during admission. One patient was without symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) whereas the other had severe respiratory symptoms requiring a stay at an intensive care unit (ICU) and treatment with remdesivir and dexamethasone. Despite their difference in clinical courses, they both continuously shed SARS-CoV-2 with high viral loads in culture. Both patients had undetectable anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels about 2 weeks after the first positive real time RT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2, marked expansions of virus reactive CD8+ T cells but cellular markers indicative of attenuated humoral immunity. Conclusions: Our case illustrates the importance of distinguishing isolation guidelines for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 according to their immunological status. Furthermore, it demonstrates the need for immune markers relating to viral shedding in immunocompromised patients."
9325,Dynamic anti-spike protein antibody profiles in COVID-19 patients.,"Objectives: This study intended to investigate the dynamics of anti-spike (S) IgG and IgM antibodies in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-S IgG/IgM was determined by a semi-quantitative fluorescence immunoassay in the plasma of COVID-19 patients at the manifestation and rehabilitation stages. The immunoreactivity to full-length S proteins, C-terminal domain (CTD), and N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 fragments were determined by an ELISA assay. Clinical properties at admission and discharge were collected simultaneously. Results: The positive rates of anti-S IgG/IgM in COVID-19 patients were elevated after rehabilitation compared to the in-patients. Anti-S IgG and IgM were not apparent until day 14 and day ten, respectively, according to Simple Moving Average analysis with five days' slide window deduction. More than 90% of the rehabilitation patients exhibited IgG and IgM responses targeting CTD-S1 fragments. Decreased total peripheral lymphocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts were seen in COVID-19 patients at admission and recovered after the rehabilitation. Conclusions: Anti-S IgG and IgM do not appear at the onset with the decrease in T cells, making early serological screening less significant. However, the presence of high IgG and IgM to S1-CTD in the recovered patients highlights humoral responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be associated with efficient immune protection in COVID-19 patients."
9326,Emergency management at the health and security interface.,"The world has recently witnessed the global impact of natural disease outbreaks, such as those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and the lasting impact of the accidental spread of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom. Natural outbreaks, of both emerging and re-emerging diseases, can have significant impacts on local, national and regional communities. An effective response to these outbreaks relies heavily on the coordination of both public health and Veterinary Services to identify the signs, symptoms and patterns of disease quickly and respond accordingly. The future global risks related to infectious disease are influenced by several factors, including human migration, urban development, agricultural development and climate change. As technology advances, we are more aware of the potential risks associated with dual-use equipment and research (defined as equipment or research that can be used for legitimate as well as nefarious purposes), synthetic biology, the engineering of biological systems, and the evolving modus operandi of criminals and terrorist groups. The ability to detect natural, accidental or deliberate outbreaks and incidents will rely heavily on cross-agency communication, establishment of informationsharing platforms, development of joint investigative strategies, and recognition that effective response requires a strong health and security agency interface. Therefore, the management of a suspicious biological incident requires intersectoral and interregional cooperation employing a comprehensive approach which considers prevention, preparedness, response and recovery and identifies and considers the unique characteristics and requirements of the incident."
9327,Cerebrospinal fluid in COVID-19: A systematic review of the literature.,"Objective: We sought to review the literature on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing in patients with COVID-19 for evidence of viral neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase between December 1, 2019 and November 18, 2020 to identify case reports or series of patients who had COVID-19 diagnosed based on positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serologic testing and had CSF testing due to a neurologic symptom. Results: We identified 242 relevant documents which included 430 patients with COVID-19 who had acute neurological symptoms prompting CSF testing. Of those, 321 (75%) patients had symptoms that localized to the central nervous system (CNS). Of 304 patients whose CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 PCR, there were 17 (6%) whose test was positive, all of whom had symptoms that localized to the central nervous system (CNS). The majority (13/17, 76%) of these patients were admitted to the hospital because of neurological symptoms. Of 58 patients whose CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, 7 (12%) had positive antibodies with evidence of intrathecal synthesis, all of whom had symptoms that localized to the CNS. Of 132 patients who had oligoclonal bands evaluated, 3 (2%) had evidence of intrathecal antibody synthesis. Of 77 patients tested for autoimmune antibodies in the CSF, 4 (5%) had positive findings. Conclusion: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF via PCR or evaluation for intrathecal antibody synthesis appears to be rare. Most neurological complications associated with SARS- CoV-2 are unlikely to be related to direct viral neuroinvasion."

9329,Phase 1/2 trial of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with a booster dose induces multifunctional antibody responses.,"More than 190 vaccines are currently in development to prevent infection by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Animal studies suggest that while neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein may correlate with protection, additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection. Previously, we reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18-55 years ( NCT04324606 ). Now we describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in that trial, who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; n = 20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; n = 32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56 d following prime vaccination. Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; n = 10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; n = 10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose. These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials."
