6310,COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in pregnant women.,"Objective: To determine vaccine acceptance and hesitancy attitudes toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in pregnant women. Methods: Three hundred pregnant women were surveyed face to face with 40 questions. Sociodemographic characteristics, vaccination history, perception of risk for the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and acceptance of and attitude toward future COVID-19 vaccination were prospectively evaluated. Results: Among all participants, 111 (37%) stated their intent to receive the vaccine if it were recommended for pregnant women. Most common refusal reasons were lack of data about COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant populations and possibility of harm to the fetus. There was a weak positive correlation between COVID-19 vaccine acceptancy and number of school-age children. Pregnant women in the first trimester expressed higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination than those in the second and third trimesters. Conclusion: The present study reported low acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in a sample of pregnant women. Concern about vaccine safety was the major reason for hesitancy. Identifying attitudes among priority groups will be useful for creating vaccination strategies that increase uptake during the current pandemic."
6311,Challenges in evaluating SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.,
6312,SARS-CoV-2 spike variants exhibit differential infectivity and neutralization resistance to convalescent or post-vaccination sera.,"Toward eradicating the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines that induce high humoral and cellular immune responses are essential. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants have begun to emerge and raise concerns, as they may potentially compromise vaccine efficiency. Here, we monitored neutralization potency of convalescent or Pfizer-BTN162b2 post-vaccination sera against pseudoviruses displaying spike proteins derived from wild-type SARS-CoV-2, or its UK-B.1.1.7 and SA-B.1.351 variants. Compared to convalescent sera, vaccination induces high titers of neutralizing antibodies, which exhibit efficient neutralization potential against pseudovirus carrying wild-type SARS-CoV-2. However, while wild-type and UK-N501Y pseudoviruses were similarly neutralized, those displaying SA-N501Y/K417N/E484K spike mutations moderately resist neutralization. Contribution of single or combined spike mutations to neutralization and infectivity were monitored, highlighting mechanisms by which viral infectivity and neutralization resistance are enhanced by N501Y or E484K/K417N mutations. Our study validates the importance of the Pfizer vaccine but raises concerns regarding its efficacy against specific SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants."
6313,Group testing as a strategy for COVID-19 epidemiological monitoring and community surveillance.,We propose an analysis and applications of sample pooling to the epidemiologic monitoring of COVID-19. We first introduce a model of the RT-qPCR process used to test for the presence of virus in a sample and construct a statistical model for the viral load in a typical infected individual inspired by large-scale clinical datasets. We present an application of group testing for the prevention of epidemic outbreak in closed connected communities. We then propose a method for the measure of the prevalence in a population taking into account the increased number of false negatives associated with the group testing method.

6315,Factors associated with high compliance behaviour against COVID-19 in the early phase of pandemic: a cross-sectional study in 12 Asian countries.,"Introduction: Regardless of having effective vaccines against COVID-19, containment measures such as enhanced physical distancing and good practice of personal hygiene remain the mainstay of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries across Asia have imposed these containment measures to varying extents. However, residents in different countries would have a differing degree of compliance to these containment measures potentially due to differences in the level of awareness and motivation in the early phase of pandemic. Objectives: In our study, we aimed to describe and correlate the level of knowledge and attitude with the level of compliance with personal hygiene and physical distancing practices among Asian countries in the early phase of pandemic. Methods: A multinational cross-sectional study was carried out using electronic surveys between May and June 2020 across 14 geographical areas. Subjects aged 21 years and above were invited to participate through social media, word of mouth and electronic mail. Results: Among the 2574 responses obtained, 762 (29.6%) participants were from East Asia and 1812 (70.4%) were from Southeast Asia (SEA). A greater proportion of participants from SEA will practise physical distancing as long as it takes (72.8% vs 60.6%). Having safe distancing practices such as standing more than 1 or 2 m apart (AdjOR 5.09 95% CI (1.08 to 24.01)) or more than 3 or 4 m apart (AdjOR 7.05 95% CI (1.32 to 37.67)), wearing a mask when they had influenza-like symptoms before the COVID-19 pandemic, preferring online news channels such as online news websites/applications (AdjOR 1.73 95% CI (1.21 to 2.49)) and social media (AdjOR 1.68 95% CI (1.13 to 2.50) as sources of obtaining information about COVID-19 and high psychological well-being (AdjOR 1.39 95% CI (1.04 to 1.87)) were independent factors associated with high compliance. Conclusions: We found factors associated with high compliance behaviour against COVID-19 in the early phase of pandemic and it will be useful to consider them in risk assessment, communication and pandemic preparedness."
6316,Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme 2 and Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors in COVID-19: An Update.,"Ever since its outbreak, Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 26 million individuals in more than 200 countries. Although the mortality rate of COVID-19 is low, but several clinical studies showed, patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) or other major complication at high risk of COVID-19 and reported more severe disease and increased fatality. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of renin-angiotensin-system (RAS); acts on ACE/Ang-II/AT1recptor axis, and regulates pathological processes like hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) etc. The progression of T2DM and hypertension show decreased expression and activity of ACE2. There are several treatment strategies for controlling diabetes, hypertension, etc; like ACE2 gene therapies, endogenous ACE2 activators, human recombinant ACE2 (hrACE2), Angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors (ACEi) medications. ACE2, the receptors for SARS-CoV2, facilitates virus entry inside host cell. Clinicians are using two classes of medications for the treatment of COVID-19; one targets the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interaction, while other targets human immune system. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of ACE2 in diabetes and in COVID-19 and to provide an analysis of data proposing harm and benefit of RAS inhibitor treatment in COVID-19 infection as well as showing no association whatsoever. This review also highlights some candidate vaccines which are undergoing clinical trials."

6318,[CME/Answers: Hypertension and the COVID-19 Pandemic: What to Consider in Medical Practice].,"CME/Answers: Hypertension and the COVID-19 Pandemic: What to Consider in Medical Practice Abstract. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health problem. A fraction of the population is at increased risk of developing complications of this disease, in particular older subjects as well as diabetic, obese and hypertensive patients. With regard to patients with high blood pressure, the existence of an increased risk remains to be confirmed in large controlled trials. So far the findings regarding this question are reassuring, whether these patients are treated or not. There seems to be no reason to worry when using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. The observations available to date suggest that COVID-19 vaccine can be administered safely to hypertensive patients. In conclusion, there is no reason to implement changes in the care of hypertensive patients due to the pandemic."
6319,Assessment of Effectiveness of 1 Dose of BNT162b2 Vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 Infection 13 to 24 Days After Immunization.,"Importance: The BNT162b2 vaccine showed high efficacy against COVID-19 in a phase III randomized clinical trial. A vaccine effectiveness evaluation in a real-world setting is needed. Objective: To assess the short-term effectiveness of the first dose of the BNT162b2-vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection 13 to 24 days after immunization in a real-world setting. Design, setting, and participants: This comparative effectiveness study used data from a 2.6 million-member state-mandated health care system in Israel. Participants included all individuals aged 16 years and older who received 1 dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine between December 19, 2020, and January 15, 2021. Data were analyzed in March 2021. Exposure: Receipt of 1 dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Main outcomes and measures: Information was collected regarding medical history and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test and COVID-19 symptoms from 1 day after first vaccine to January 17, 2021. Daily and cumulative infection rates in days 13 to 24 were compared with days 1 to 12 after the first dose using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and generalized linear models. Results: Data for 503 875 individuals (mean [SD] age, 59.7 [14.7] years; 263 228 [52.4%] women) were analyzed, of whom 351 897 had follow-up data for days 13 to 24. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2484 individuals (0.57%) during days 1 through 12 and 614 individuals (0.27%) in days 13 through 24. The weighted mean (SE) daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in days 1 through 12 was 43.41 (12.07) infections per 100 000 population and 21.08 (6.16) infections per 100 000 population in days 13 through 24, a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 51.4% (95% CI, 16.3%-71.8%). The decrease in incidence was evident from day 18 after the first dose. Similar RRRs were calculated in individuals aged 60 years or older (44.5%; 95% CI, 4.1%-67.9%), those younger than 60 years (50.2%; 95% CI, 14.1%-71.2%), women (50.0%; 95% CI, 13.5%-71.0%), and men (52.1%; 95% CI, 17.3%-72.2%). Findings were similar in subpopulations (eg, ultraorthodox Jewish: RRR, 53.5% [95% CI, 19.2%-73.2%]) and patients with various comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular diseases: RRR, 47.2% [95% CI, 7.8%-69.8%]). Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 was 54.4% (95% CI, 21.4%-73.6%). Conclusions and relevance: In this comparative effectiveness study of a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, results were comparable to that of the phase III randomized clinical trial."
