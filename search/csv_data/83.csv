820,Adding saliva testing to oropharyngeal and deep nasal swab testing increases PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in primary care and children.,"Objective: To compare the concordance and acceptability of saliva testing with standard-of-care oropharyngeal and bilateral deep nasal swab testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children and in general practice. Design: Prospective multicentre diagnostic validation study. Setting: Royal Children's Hospital, and two general practices (cohealth, West Melbourne; Cirqit Health, Altona North) in Melbourne, July-October 2020. Participants: 1050 people who provided paired saliva and oropharyngeal-nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Main outcome measures: Numbers of cases in which SARS-CoV-2 was detected in either specimen type by real-time polymerase chain reaction; concordance of results for paired specimens; positive percent agreement (PPA) for virus detection, by specimen type. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 54 of 1050 people with assessable specimens (5%), including 19 cases (35%) in which both specimens were positive. The overall PPA was 72% (95% CI, 58-84%) for saliva and 63% (95% CI, 49-76%) for oropharyngeal-nasal swabs. For the 35 positive specimens from people aged 10 years or more, PPA was 86% (95% CI, 70-95%) for saliva and 63% (95% CI, 45-79%) for oropharyngeal-nasal swabs. Adding saliva testing to standard-of-care oropharyngeal-nasal swab testing increased overall case detection by 59% (95% CI, 29-95%). Providing saliva was preferred to an oropharyngeal-nasal swab by most participants (75%), including 141 of 153 children under 10 years of age (92%). Conclusion: In children over 10 years of age and adults, saliva testing alone may be suitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection, while for children under 10, saliva testing may be suitable as an adjunct to oropharyngeal-nasal swab testing for increasing case detection."

822,SARS-CoV-2 serology testing: Progress and challenges.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the most devasting social and economic impact of this century. The current pandemic will end only after a safe, effective vaccine becomes available and protective herd immunity has been achieved through vaccination. The key parameter to gauge protective immunity is neutralizing antibody levels. Thus, reliable serology testing is essential to diagnose whether an individual has been previously infected, as a large proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is asymptomatic. For both naturally infected and vaccinated individuals, it is critical to monitor their neutralizing antibody titers over time. This is because, when neutralizing antibody levels wane below a threshold which remains to be determined, they become vulnerable to reinfection. Due to the importance of serology testing, academia and industry have developed different platforms for serological diagnosis, many of which have achieved the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA). Here we summarize the status of COVID-19 serology testing, discuss challenges, and provide future directions for improvement."
823,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vaginal swabs of women with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection: a prospective study.,"Objective: To determine whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is present in the vaginal secretions of both reproductive-aged and postmenopausal women during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design: Prospective study. Setting: A single tertiary, university-affiliated medical centre in Israel. Time period, 1 June 2020 through to 31 July 2020. Population: Women who were hospitalised in a single tertiary medical centre, who were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection by a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test. Methods: Women were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection by a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test. Vaginal RT-PCR swabs were obtained from all study participants after a proper cleansing of the perineum. Main outcome measures: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal RT-PCR swabs. Results: Vaginal and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 35 women, aged 21-93 years. Twenty-one women (60%) were in their reproductive years, of whom, five were in their third trimester of pregnancy. Most of the participants (57%) were healthy without any underlying medical conditions. Of the 35 patients sampled, 2 (5.7%) had a positive vaginal RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, one was premenopausal and the other was a postmenopausal woman. Both women had mild disease. Conclusion: Our findings contradict most previous reports, which did not detect the presence of viral colonisation in the vagina. Although passage through the birth canal exposes neonates to the vaginal polymicrobial flora, an acquisition of pathogens does not necessarily mandate neonatal infection or clinical disease. Nevertheless, when delivering the infant of a woman with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, a clinician should consider the possibility of vaginal colonisation, even if it is uncommon. Tweetable abstract: When delivering the infant of a woman with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, a clinician should consider the possibility of vaginal colonisation."

825,COVID-19 among healthcare workers in a Southern Brazilian Hospital and evaluation of a diagnostic strategy based on the RT-PCR test and retest for Sars-CoV-2.,"Objective: Healthcare workers are at risk for COVID-19 contamination. It is important to protect them in order to reduce nosocomial transmission and maintain the assistance capacity of health systems. To evaluate the diagnostic test and retest strategy with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and factors associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 among healthcare workers. Patients and methods: Cross-sectional study carried out in a Brazilian hospital. From April 27 to June 16, 2020, symptomatic healthcare workers underwent an RT-PCR test on upper respiratory tract specimens as soon as possible and, if negative, it was repeated close to the 5th day of symptom evolution. Working areas were divided into assistance areas dedicated or not dedicated to COVID-19 and non-assistance areas. The type of activity was divided into assistance or non-assistance activity. Results: 775 individuals were evaluated. 114 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 101 followed the testing protocol. A second RT-PCR identified five (4.9%) of the positive cases. Working in an area dedicated to patients with COVID-19 was more prevalent among positive cases (35.1% x 19.8%, p=0.001) as well as working in an assistance activity (80.7% x 70.8%, p=0.031). Conclusions: A second RT-PCR test after the 5th day of symptom evolution showed limited diagnostic improvement. The adoption of a single test-based strategy, carried out at the right time after the onset of symptoms, allows the optimal use of resources. Working in a COVID-19 dedicated area and in direct contact with patients is related to a higher prevalence of COVID-19 among symptomatic healthcare workers."
826,Biosensor and molecular-based methods for the detection of human coronaviruses: A review.,"The ongoing crisis due to the global pandemic caused by a highly contagious coronavirus (Coronavirus disease - 2019; COVID-19) and the lack of either proven effective therapy or a vaccine has made diagnostic a valuable tool in disease tracking and prevention. The complex nature of this newly emerging virus calls for scientists' attention to find the most reliable, highly sensitive, and selective detection techniques for better control or spread of the disease. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology-based tests are currently being used. However, the speed and accuracy of these tests may not meet the current demand; thus, alternative technology platforms are being developed. Nano biosensor technology platforms have been established as a promising diagnostic tool for rapid and accurate detection of viruses as well as other life-threatening diseases even in resource-limited settings. This review aims to provide a short overview of recent advancements in molecular and biosensor-based diagnosis of viruses, including the human coronaviruses, and highlight the challenges and future perspectives of these detection technologies."
827,CRISPR systems: Novel approaches for detection and combating COVID-19.,"Type V and VI CRISPR enzymes are RNA-guided, DNA and RNA-targeting effectors that allow specific gene knockdown. Cas12 and Cas13 are CRISPR proteins that are efficient agents for diagnosis and combating single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses. The programmability of these proteins paves the way for the detection and degradation of RNA viruses by targeting RNAs complementary to its CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Approximately two-thirds of viruses causing diseases contain ssRNA genomes. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has infected more than 88 million people worldwide with near 2 million deaths since December 2019. Thus, accurate and rapid diagnostic and therapeutic tools are essential for early detection and treatment of this widespread infectious disease. For us, the CRISPR based platforms seem to be a plausible new approach for an accurate detection and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we talk about Cas12 and Cas13 CRISPR systems and their applications in diagnosis and treatment of RNA virus mediated diseases. In continue, the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, and its conventional diagnostics and antivirals will be discussed. Moreover, we highlight novel CRISPR based diagnostic platforms and therapies for COVID-19. We also discuss the challenges of diagnostic CRISPR based platforms as well as clarifying the proposed solution for high efficient selective in vivo delivery of CRISPR components into SARS-CoV-2-infected cells."
828,Shedding of Viable Virus in Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Carriers.,"Information regarding the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in asymptomatic carriers is scarce. In order to determine the duration of infectivity and its correlation with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) results and time since initial positive PCR test in this population, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 cell infectivity in nasopharyngeal samples longitudinally obtained from asymptomatic carriers who disembarked from a cruise ship during a COVID-19 outbreak. Of 166 nasopharyngeal samples collected from 39 asymptomatic carriers every 48 h until two consecutive negative PCR test results were obtained, SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from 9 PCR-positive samples which were obtained from 7 persons (18%; 7/39). Viable viruses were isolated predominantly within 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, except for one person who shed viable virus until day 15. The median crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR of culture-positive samples was 24.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 20.4 to 25.8; range, 17.9 to 30.3), and Cp values were significantly associated with isolation of viable virus (odds ratio, 0.496; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.329 to 0.747; P value, 0.001), which was consistent with existing data for symptomatic patients. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 samples consecutively obtained from a person who shed viable virus for 15 days identified the emergence of two novel single nucleotide variants (C8626T transition and C18452T transition) in the sample collected on day 15, with the latter corresponding to an amino acid substitution in nonstructural protein 14. The impact of these mutations on prolonged viable-virus shedding is unclear. These findings underscore the potential role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission.IMPORTANCE A growing number of studies suggest the potential role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers as a major driver of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, virological assessment of asymptomatic infection has largely been limited to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), which can be persistently positive without necessarily indicating the presence of viable virus (e.g., replication-competent virus). Here, we evaluated the infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers by detecting SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects on Vero cells using longitudinally obtained nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic carriers. We show that asymptomatic carriers can shed viable virus until 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, with one outlier shedding until day 15. The crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR was the leading predictive factor for virus viability. These findings provide additional insights into the role of asymptomatic carriers as a source of transmission and highlight the importance of universal source control measures, along with isolation policy for asymptomatic carriers."
829,Prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in elective surgical patients in Australia: a prospective surveillance study.,"Background: The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of active or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic adults admitted for elective surgery in Australian hospitals. This surveillance activity was established as part of the National Pandemic Health Intelligence Plan. Methods: Participants (n = 3037) were recruited from 11 public and private hospitals in four states (NSW, Vic, SA and WA) between 2 June and 17 July 2020, with an overall 66% participation rate. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was assessed by Reverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs taken after induction of anaesthesia. Presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was assessed by analysis of serum collected at the same time using a novel dual-antigen ELISA assay. Results: No patient (0/3010) returned a positive RT-PCR result. The Bayesian estimated prevalence of active infection of 0.02% (95% probability interval 0.00-0.11%), with the upper endpoint being 1 in 918. Positive serology (IgG) was observed in 15 of 2991 patients, with a strong positive in five of those individuals (Bayesian estimated seroprevalence 0.16%; 95% probability interval 0.00-0.47%). Conclusion: These results confirm that during periods of low community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 elective surgery patients without fever or respiratory symptoms had a very low prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection."
