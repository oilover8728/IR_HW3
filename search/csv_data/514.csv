5130,COVID-19 vaccine and the cold chain implications for global adoption.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally with 190.8 million infected cases and 4.1 million deaths as of July 18, 2021. In absence of any definite antiviral agent availability and therapeutic armamentarium, vaccines are considered critical. While 20 vaccines are in use, about 295 vaccines are underdevelopment globally using eleven technological platforms. While the vaccines have >80% efficacy, the ultracold (-70°C and -20°C) storage and logistics requirements for some raise concerns for implementation, especially in developing countries. The Ebola vaccination in African countries, which required an ultracold chain provided lessons for these COVID-19 vaccines. The existing vaccine cold chain system suffers from temperature excursions at cold chain stores and during transportations in different countries suggests careful assessment and addressing the gaps for effective vaccine introduction. Appropriate attention for cold chain storage, logistics (especially the last mile), and vaccine management and upgradation is needed to achieve optimal vaccine effectiveness for curtailing the pandemic."

5133,"[Rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigenic test: definition, legislation of use, technological principles, analytical and clinical performance comparison].","The SARS-CoV-2 has emerged in China at the end of 2019. In order to meet the growing demand in laboratories for RT-PCR testing for viral genome detection, rapid tests detecting a SARS-CoV-2 protein (antigenic rapid test) have been developed. In this review, we present for different SARS-CoV-2 antigenic rapid tests authorized in France: legislation, technological principle, and analytical and clinical performances. Data bellow are those provided by the manufacturer/distributor. From the list of tests authorized by the French Ministry of Health, we have selected 25 for which the distributors/manufacturers have provided the technical data essential to their comparative analysis. The kits use immunochromatography technology, with detection of the nucleocapsid protein (n = 24) or the spike protein (n = 1). The matrix used is a nasopharyngeal (n = 23), oropharyngeal (n = 9) or nasal (n = 3) swab. According to the test, the reading of the result is done from 15 to 30 minutes after it is performed. The clinical sensitivity, for the more performant tests is conversely linked to the Ct of RT-PCR, ranging from 80.2% to 98.4%, according to the quantity of virus present in the sample. This percentage is inversely proportional to the Ct obtained using RT-PCR. The limit of detection ranges from 31.55 to 7200 TCID50/mL. The clinical specificity, compared to a negative result of RT-PCR, is between 99.2% and 100%. Analytical specificity evaluated on other microorganisms is 100%, except for 3 kits that show cross-reactivities with SARS-CoV-1 (n = 3) and MERS-CoV (n = 1). Positive and negative predictive values range from 96.3% to 100% and 95% to 99.4%, respectively."

5135,Acute acral cutaneous manifestations during the COVID-19 pandemic: a single-centre experience.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), was first reported in China on December 2019. Almost 5 months into the pandemic, little is still known about cutaneous manifestations in COVID‐19. In fact, the prevalence of cutaneous signs varies greatly in the literature, ranging from 0.2% to 20.4%. Given their potential association with COVID‐19, acral lesions have received special attention worldwide, both in the medical literature and the media. Our aim is to share our experience regarding acral manifestations during this pandemic."
5136,Editorial: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Pregnancy Outcomes from Current Global Study Data.,"During the global COVID-19 pandemic, data from clinical studies, systematic review, and population registry data have shown that when compared with non-pregnant women, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is associated with a small increase in risk to the mother. Large cohort studies and registry data collected from 2020 have included the US Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET), COVI-PREG, the UK and Global Pregnancy and Neonatal Outcomes in COVID-19 (PAN-COVID) study, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine (SONPM) National Perinatal COVID-19 Registry, the Swedish Pregnancy Register, and the Canadian Surveillance of COVID-19 in Pregnancy (CANCOVID-Preg) registry. Recently published data have shown that most maternal infections with SARS-CoV-2 occur during the third trimester and result in a small increase in hospital admission, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, preterm birth, and increased cesarean sections in mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, currently approved vaccines given in pregnancy result in an immune response to current SARS-CoV-2 variants. Transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the fetus can occur, but the immediate and long-term effects on the newborn infant remain unclear. Therefore, women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy should be managed according to current clinical guidelines with timely vaccination to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2. This Editorial summarizes what is currently known about maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and pregnancy outcomes from multinational studies."

5138,Pregnancy Outcomes Among Women With and Without Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection.,"Importance: Published data suggest that there are increased hospitalizations, placental abnormalities, and rare neonatal transmission among pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objectives: To evaluate adverse outcomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy and to describe clinical management, disease progression, hospital admission, placental abnormalities, and neonatal outcomes. Design, setting, and participants: This observational cohort study of maternal and neonatal outcomes among delivered women with and without SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy was conducted from March 18 through August 22, 2020, at Parkland Health and Hospital System (Dallas, Texas), a high-volume prenatal clinic system and public maternity hospital with widespread access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings. Women were included if they were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and delivered. For placental analysis, the pathologist was blinded to illness severity. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was a composite of preterm birth, preeclampsia with severe features, or cesarean delivery for abnormal fetal heart rate among women delivered after 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal illness severity, neonatal infection, and placental abnormalities were described. Results: From March 18 through August 22, 2020, 3374 pregnant women (mean [SD] age, 27.6 [6] years) tested for SARS-CoV-2 were delivered, including 252 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 3122 who tested negative. The cohort included 2520 Hispanic (75%), 619 Black (18%), and 125 White (4%) women. There were no differences in age, parity, body mass index, or diabetes among women with or without SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was more common among Hispanic women (230 [91%] positive vs 2290 [73%] negative; difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 12.3%-23.5%; P < .001). There was no difference in the composite primary outcome (52 women [21%] vs 684 women [23%]; relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.73-1.21; P = .64). Early neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 6 of 188 tested infants (3%), primarily born to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. There were no placental pathologic differences by illness severity. Maternal illness at initial presentation was asymptomatic or mild in 239 women (95%), and 6 of those women (3%) developed severe or critical illness. Fourteen women (6%) were hospitalized for the indication of COVID-19. Conclusions and relevance: In a large, single-institution cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Neonatal infection may be as high as 3% and may occur predominantly among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. Placental abnormalities were not associated with disease severity, and hospitalization frequency was similar to rates among nonpregnant women."
5139,Experimental SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Bank Voles.,"After experimental inoculation, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was confirmed in bank voles by seroconversion within 8 days and detection of viral RNA in nasal tissue for up to 21 days. However, transmission to contact animals was not detected. Thus, bank voles are unlikely to establish effective transmission cycles in nature."
