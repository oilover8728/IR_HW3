6501,"COVID-19 prevalence, symptoms, and sociodemographic disparities in infection among insured pregnant women in Northern California.","Background: Research on COVID-19 during pregnancy has mainly focused on women hospitalized for COVID-19 or other reasons during their pregnancy. Little is known about COVID-19 in the general population of pregnant women. Objective: To describe the prevalence of COVID-19, symptoms, consequent healthcare use, and possible sources of COVID-19 exposure among a population-based sample of pregnant women residing in Northern California. Methods: We analyzed data from 19,458 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were pregnant between January 2020 and April 2021 and responded to an online survey about COVID-19 testing, diagnosis, symptoms, and their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical diagnosis of COVID-19 during pregnancy was defined separately by self-report and by documentation in electronic health records (EHR). We examined relationships of COVID-19 with sociodemographic factors, underlying comorbidities, and survey measures of COVID-19-like symptoms, consequent healthcare utilization, and possible COVID-19 exposures. Results: Among 19,458 respondents, the crude prevalence of COVID-19 was 2.5% (n = 494) according to self-report and 1.4% (n = 276) according to EHR. After adjustment, the prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was higher among women aged <25 years compared with women aged ≥35 years (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.75, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.49) and among Hispanic women compared with White women (PR, 1.91, 95% CI: 1.53, 2.37). Prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was higher among women affected by personal or partner job loss during the pandemic (PR, 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.47) and among women living in areas of high vs. low neighborhood deprivation (PR, 1.74, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.27). We did not observe differences in self-reported COVID-19 between women with and without underlying comorbidities. Results were similar for EHR-documented COVID-19. Loss of smell or taste was a unique and common symptom reported among women with COVID-19 (42.3% in self-reported; 54.0% in EHR-documented). Among women with symptomatic COVID-19, approximately 2% were hospitalized, 71% had a telehealth visit, and 75% quarantined at home. Over a third of women with COVID-19 reported no known exposure to someone with COVID-19. Conclusions: Observed COVID-19 prevalence differences by sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors underscore social and health inequities among reproductive-aged women. Women with COVID-19 reported unique symptoms and low frequency of hospitalization. Many were not aware of an exposure to someone with COVID-19."

6503,A reverse-transcription recombinase-aided amplification assay for the rapid detection of N gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2).,"The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in China firstly. A rapid, highly sensitive, specific, and simple operational method was needed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we established a real-time reverse-transcription recombinase-aided amplification assay (RT-RAA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 rapidly. The primers and probe were designed based on the nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene) sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The detection limit was 10 copies per reaction in this assay, which could be conducted within 15 min at a constant temperature (39 °C), without any cross-reactions with other respiratory tract pathogens, such as other coronaviruses. Furthermore, compared with commercial real-time RT-PCR assay, it showed a kappa value of 0.959 (p < 0.001) from 150 clinical specimens. These results indicated that this real-time RT-RAA assay may be a valuable tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2."
6504,SARS-CoV-2 Human Challenge Trials: Rethinking the Recruitment of Healthy Young Adults First.,"In the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, researchers across the globe are still working to develop effective vaccines. To expedite this process even further, human challenge trials have been proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an alternative to conventional approaches. In such trials, healthy volunteers are deliberately infected with the pathogen of interest, enabling scientists to study the infection process and facilitate further research on treatments or prophylactics, including vaccines. While human challenge trials would offer a collective benefit to society, minimizing the risks is always difficult. Ethical controversy thus inevitably surrounds these trials. Typically, healthy young adults are recruited to serve as the first candidate subjects for human challenge trials because they are generally considered to represent a low-risk population. Here, we present three reasons for doubt about this healthy-young-adults-first criterion and give justification for also recruiting healthy older adults (or not-young adults), meaning those over 30 years of age, to participate in such trials for SARS-CoV-2."
6505,The CHIR Score for Evaluating the Hyperimmune Response in COVID-19: A Preliminary Concept.,"Similar to SARS and MERS, the host immune response to COVID-19 is implicated in the severity of the disease itself. Here, we investigate the possible use of scoring systems to help guide clinicians in their determination as to when to commence immunosuppressive treatment in COVID-19. We utilized the relatively established clinical and biochemical severity indicators from large cohort studies to develop a potential scoring system for the hyperimmune response in COVID-19."
6506,"SARS-CoV-2: basic concepts, origin and treatment advances.","The first cases of COVID-19, caused by the virus called SARS-CoV-2, were recorded in Wuhan, China, in December 2019; however, its transmission ability caused for the infection to be practically present throughout the world six months later. The origin of the virus appears to be zoonotic; it has been proposed that it comes from a bat and that it may have had an intermediate host that led to its introduction in the human population. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, with a positive single-stranded RNA genome, and it binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme, present in susceptible cells, to infect the human respiratory system. Although other coronaviruses have been previously known, they have not had the same impact, and, therefore, research on pharmacological treatments is not sufficiently developed to face the current challenge. Almost since the beginning of the epidemic, several molecules have been proposed for the treatment of infection; however, there is not yet a drug available with sufficient effectiveness for treatment. This review describes SARS-CoV-2 main characteristics, its replicative cycle, its possible origin and some advances in the development of antiviral treatments."
6507,Animal Hosts and Experimental Models of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Viruses arise through cross-species transmission and can cause potentially fatal diseases in humans. This is the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which recently appeared in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread worldwide, causing the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and posing a global health emergency. Sequence analysis and epidemiological investigations suggest that the most likely original source of SARS-CoV-2 is a spillover from an animal reservoir, probably bats, that infected humans either directly or through intermediate animal hosts. The role of animals as reservoirs and natural hosts in SARS-CoV-2 has to be explored, and animal models for COVID-19 are needed as well to be evaluated for countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Experimental cells, tissues, and animal models that are currently being used and developed in COVID-19 research will be presented."
6508,Impaired anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in non-severe COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus: A preliminary report.,"Background and aims: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) often demonstrate impaired antibody response to influenza/hepatitis B vaccines. Hence, we compared anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in non-severe COVID-19 patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: Records of non-severe COVID-19 patients admitted at our institution between April 10, 2020 and May 20, 2020 were retrieved. Qualitative detection of total (IgG + IgM) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was performed using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in plasma samples collected at least 14 days post-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation of diagnosis. Results: Thirty-one non-severe COVID-19 patients were included. Nine patients (29%) had T2DM with mean HbA1c at admission of 8.3 ± 1.0%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was estimated at a median of 16 (14-17) days post-PCR confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis. Only three patients (10%) were seronegative, and all had T2DM. Patients with T2DM were more likely to have non-detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than those without DM (p = 0.019). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with T2DM may not undergo seroconversion even after two weeks of diagnosis. Impaired seroconversion could theoretically increase the risk of reinfections in patients with DM. However, the finding requires validation in large-scale studies involving serial estimations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with and without DM."
6509,"Stem cell therapy in COVID-19: Pooled evidence from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and ARDS: A systematic review.","Background: SARS-CoV-2, which majorly affects the lungs and respiratory tract is thought due to dysregulation of the immune system which causes an immense imbalance of the cytokines. However, till now no standard treatment has been developed in treating the disease. On the other hand, it becomes important to prevent the acute respiratory tract infection due to COVID-19 which is the most dangerous phase leading to increased mortality. Hence this systematic review has been framed by pooling the available data of the use of stem cells in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and ARDS. Methods: 6 literature databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Clinical trial registry of India) were searched for relevant studies till 10th August 2020 using keywords stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, cell therapy, SARS CoV-2, SARS Coronavirus, Coronavirus 2, COVID-19, nCoV-19, Novel Coronavirus, MERS CoV, ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome. Results: The observations of this systematic review suggest capability of MSCs in reducing the systemic inflammation and protecting against SARS-CoV-2 as evidenced by the available clinical data. Conclusion: MSCs can overcome the clinical challenges currently faced by SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, specifically who are seriously ill and not responding to conventional therapies. Though the available clinical data is motivating, still predicting the therapeutic potential of MSCs will be too early in COVID-19. Hence, further studies in a larger cohort of patients becomes a prerequisite to validate their potential efficacy."
