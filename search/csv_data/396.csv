3950,[Analysis of low positive rate of nucleic acid detection method used for diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia].,"新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）是由2019新型冠状病毒（2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV）感染引起的一种急性传染性疾病，基于实时荧光逆转录-聚合酶链反应（RT-PCR）方法的病毒核酸检测是临床确诊的重要手段，但目前临床通过2019-nCoV的核酸检测结果确诊COVID-19存在阳性率偏低的现象。为明确这一问题出现的原因，本文在充分肯定核酸检测用于确诊COVID-19应用价值的基础上，从患者病程、标本采集、标本运输与保存、标本处理、核酸提取与扩增、病毒核酸变异等方面进行了分析，找出了影响核酸检测结果准确可靠的可能因素并提出了相应的建议。."

3956,Management of Unilateral Axillary Lymphadenopathy Detected on Breast MRI in the Era of COVID-19 Vaccination.,"Early clinical experience with COVID-19 vaccination suggests that approved COVID-19 vaccines cause a notably higher incidence of axillary lymphadenopathy on breast MRI compared with other vaccines. Guidelines are needed to appropriately manage unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy detected by MRI in the era of COVID-19 vaccination and to avoid biopsies of benign reactive nodes. This article examines the available data on vaccine-related lymphadenopathy and offers a basic strategy for assessing axillary lymphadenopathy on MRI and guiding management. At our institution, we are adding questions regarding the date(s) and laterality of administration of COVID-19 vaccination to the intake form given to patients before all breast imaging examinations. We consider MRI-detected isolated unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy ipsilateral to the vaccination arm to most likely be related to the COVID-19 vaccine if it develops within 4 weeks of administration of either dose. In these cases, we assess the lymphadenopathy as BI-RADS 3 and recommend that follow-up ultrasound be performed within 6-8 weeks after administration of the second dose. These guidelines may be refined as we acquire further data on the expected time course of axillary lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination. Until that time, this management pathway will help avoid unnecessary biopsies of benign vaccine-related reactive lymphadenopathy."

3958,Considerations for Pooled Testing of Employees for SARS-CoV-2.,"Objectives: To identify important background information on pooled tested of employees that employers workers, and health authorities should consider. Methods: This paper is a commentary based on the review by the authors of pertinent literature generally from preprints in medrixiv.org prior to August 2020. Results/conclusions: Pooled testing may be particularly useful to employers in communities with low prevalence of COVID-19. It can be used to reduce the number of tests and associated financial costs. For effective and efficient pooled testing employers should consider it as part of a broader, more comprehensive workplace COVID-19 prevention and control program. Pooled testing of asymptomatic employees can prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and help assure employers and customers that employees are not infectious."
3959,Immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in heart transplant recipients - a prospective cohort study.,"Aims: To assess the short-term immunogenicity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccine in a population of heart transplant (HTx) recipients. A prospective single-centre cohort study of HTx recipients who received a two-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech). Methods and results: Whole blood for anti-spike IgG (S-IgG) antibodies was drawn at days 21-26 and at days 35-40 after the first vaccine dose. Geometric mean titres (GMT) ≥50 AU/mL were interpreted positive. Included were 42 HTx recipients at a median age of 61 [interquartile range (IQR) 44-69] years. Median time from HTx to the first vaccine dose was 9.1 (IQR 2.6-14) years. Only 15% of HTx recipients demonstrated the presence of positive S-IgG antibody titres in response to the first vaccine dose [GMT 90 (IQR 54-229) AU/mL]. Overall, 49% of HTx recipients induced S-IgG antibodies in response to either the first or the full two-dose vaccine schedule [GMT 426 (IQR 106-884) AU/mL]. Older age [68 (IQR 59-70) years vs. 46 (IQR 34-63) years, P = 0.034] and anti-metabolite-based immunosuppression protocols (89% vs. 44%, P = 0.011) were associated with low immunogenicity. Importantly, 36% of HTx recipients who were non-responders to the first vaccine dose became S-IgG seropositive in response to the second vaccine dose. Approximately a half of HTx recipients did not generate S-IgG antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 two-dose vaccine. Conclusions: The generally achieved protection from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination should be regarded with caution in the population of HTx recipients. The possible benefit of additive vaccine should be further studied."
