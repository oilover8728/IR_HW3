7121,Diagnosis of COVID-19 using multiple antibody assays in two cases with negative PCR results from nasopharyngeal swabs.,"We report of two cases of progressed COVID-19 with negative PCR tests from nasopharyngeal swabs, in whom diagnosis was made by different antibody assays, including a lateral flow rapid test and multiple commercial ELISAs, finally confirmed by comprehensive serological assays. These cases highlight that commercial ELISAs and even rapid tests might significantly aid the diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly, if a combination of serological assays is used with a specific clinical question, in severely ill patients after seroconversion and when comprehensive serological methods are used for confirmation."

7123,Biodistribution and serologic response in SARS-CoV-2 induced ARDS: A cohort study.,"Background: The viral load and tissue distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain important questions. The current study investigated SARS-CoV-2 viral load, biodistribution and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in patients suffering from severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Methods: This is a retrospective single-center study in 23 patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Data were collected within routine intensive care. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Overall, 478 virology samples were taken. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody detection of blood samples was performed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Most patients (91%) suffered from severe ARDS during ICU treatment with a 30-day mortality of 30%. None of the patients received antiviral treatment. Tracheal aspirates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 100% of the cases, oropharyngeal swabs only in 77%. Blood samples were positive in 26% of the patients. No difference of viral load was found in tracheal or blood samples with regard to 30-day survival or disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 was never found in dialysate. Serologic testing revealed significantly lower concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgM and IgA antibodies in survivors compared to non-survivors (p = 0.009). Conclusions: COVID-19 induced ARDS is accompanied by a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in tracheal aspirates, which remained detectable in the majority throughout intensive care treatment. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was never detected in dialysate even in patients with RNAemia. Viral load or the buildup of neutralizing antibodies was not associated with 30-day survival or disease severity."
7124,Cytosorb filter: An adjunct for survival in the COVID-19 patient in cytokine storm? a case report.,"COVID-19 is a pandemic that has affected not only the United States, but the entire world. The impact it has had has overwhelmed the entire healthcare system, from the unknown carrier status, poor testing capabilities to hospitals running out of ventilators for severely ill patients. There has been a variety of potential treatment modalities for the various forms of illness ranging from asymptomatic carriers to the ventilated ICU patients. These include anti-inflammatory medications, antibiotics, immune-modulators, convalescent plasma, and others. The cytokine storm that inflicts some patients can be devastating to the vital organs of the human body in the form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, coagulopathy, and death. CytosorbentsÂ® cytokine filter is a potential treatment methodology aimed at reducing the cytokine storm, thus serving as a bridge for therapy in the acutely ill patients infected with COVID-19. The following case report demonstrates the utility in a critically ill patient who survived the cytokine storm after receiving the cytokine filter via continuous renal replacement therapy bridging him to further definitive therapy."

7126,Factors associated with the duration of hospitalisation among COVID-19 patients in Vietnam: A survival analysis.,"Background: The median duration of hospital stays due to COVID-19 has been reported in several studies on China as 10-13 days. Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study. The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020. Method: We used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay. Results: There were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions. Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died. The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16-34) days. The multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, residence and sources of contamination were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation. Conclusion: A close look at how long COVID-19 patients stayed in the hospital could provide an overview of their treatment process in Vietnam, and support the country's National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control in the efficient allocation of resources over the next stages of the COVID-19 prevention period."
7127,Fractured aluminum nasopharyngeal swab during drive-through testing for COVID-19: radiographic detection of a retained foreign body.,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the need for safe and efficient testing as a key containment strategy. Drive-through testing with nasopharyngeal swab has been implemented in many places in the USA as it allows for expeditious testing of large numbers of patients, limits healthcare workers' risk of exposure, and minimizes the use of personal protective equipment. We present a case where the aluminum shaft of the nasopharyngeal swab fractured during specimen collection at a drive-through testing facility and was suspected to have remained in the asymptomatic patient. Initial evaluation with a series of radiographs covering the skull base, neck, chest, and abdomen did not reveal the swab. On further clinical evaluation, the swab was found endoscopically, lodged between the left inferior turbinate and nasal floor, and was removed by an otorhinolaryngologist. Using a phantom model, we aimed to delineate an imaging technique to better visualize the aluminum shaft of the nasopharyngeal swab on radiographs to help in identification. A technique using lower tube voltage (kVp) with tight collimation centered at the nasal bones area produced the best visualization of the aluminum shaft of the swab. Recognition that aluminum foreign bodies may be difficult to visualize radiographically and optimization of radiograph acquisition technique may help guide clinical management in unusual cases. Further evaluation with computed tomography or endoscopy should be considered in suspected cases where radiographs are negative."
7128,COVID-2019 among dentists in the United States: A 6-month longitudinal report of accumulative prevalence and incidence.,"Background: In 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the America Dental Association released COVID-19 infection control interim guidance for US dentists, advising the use of optimal personal protection equipment during aerosol-generating procedures. The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine the cumulative prevalence and incidence rates of COVID-19 among dentists and to assess their level of engagement in specific infection control practices. Methods: US dentists were invited to participate in a monthly web-based survey from June through November 2020. Approximately one-third of initial respondents (n = 785) participated in all 6 surveys, and they were asked about COVID-19 testing received, symptoms experienced, and infection prevention procedures followed in their primary practice. Results: Over a 6-month period, the cumulative COVID-19 infection prevalence rate was 2.6%, representing 57 dentists who ever received a diagnosis of COVID-19. The incidence rates ranged from 0.2% through 1.1% each month. The proportion of dentists tested for COVID-19 increased over time, as did the rate of dentists performing aerosol-generating procedures. Enhanced infection prevention and control strategies in the dental practice were reported by nearly every participant monthly, and rates of personal protection equipment optimization, such as changing masks after each patient, dropped over time. Conclusions: US dentists continue to show a high level of adherence to enhanced infection control procedures in response to the ongoing pandemic, resulting in low rates of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19. Dentists are showing adherence to a strict protocol for enhanced infection control, which should help protect their patients, their dental team members, and themselves. Practical implications: COVID-19 infections among practicing dentists will likely remain low if dentists continue to adhere to guidance."
7129,COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma: from donation to treatment - A Systematic Review & Single Center Experience.,"Convalescent plasma is an old treatment for a new disease. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused the analysis of convalescent plasma to reemerge as a possible treatment. First, a systematic review summarizes the available research examining the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Second, we describe our experience in establishing a single-center convalescent plasma donation program."
