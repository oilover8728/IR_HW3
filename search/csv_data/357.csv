3562,Effect of a hospital-wide campaign on COVID-19 vaccination uptake among healthcare workers in the context of raised concerns for life-threatening side effects.,"Background: All healthcare workers (HCWs) in Yongin Severance Hospital were allocated to receive the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine according to national policy. A report of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 led to hesitancy about receiving the second dose among HCWs who had received the first dose. Methods: From 7 to 14 May, 2021, we performed a survey to identify the factors associated with hesitancy about receiving the second vaccine dose among HCWs at the hospital who had received the first dose of the vaccine. Based on survey results, a hospital-wide campaign was implemented on 18 May 2021 to improve vaccine coverage. HCWs who completed the second dose completed a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the effect of the campaign. Findings: Of 1,171 HCWs who had received the first dose of the vaccine, 71.5% completed the online survey, of whom 3.7% refused to take the second dose and 22.3% showed hesitancy. Hesitancy to receive a second dose was significantly associated with age under 30 years and concerns about TTS, and was less common among those who trusted effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. Among HCWs who received the first dose, 96.2% completed vaccination with the second dose between 27 May and 4 June, 2021. Of those who answered the questionnaire asked about the timing of their decision to receive the second dose, 57.1% reported that they were motivated by the hospital-wide campaign. Conclusion: A tailored intervention strategy based on a survey can improve COVID-19 vaccination uptake among HCWs."

3564,Towards effective diagnostic assays for COVID-19: a review.,"Countries globally are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly two million cases and 120 000 deaths occurring within 4 months of the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in December 2019 in China. Accurate diagnoses of cases is key in managing the pandemic by identification, isolation and treatment of patients and defining the epidemiology of the virus. By mid-January 2020, a scientist from China published the full genome of the virus, which facilitated the development of accurate molecular diagnostic assays. By the end of January 2020, the WHO, in collaboration with laboratories in Asia, Europe and the USA, published several real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rtRT-PCR) protocols that allowed identification of cases and development of commercial assays. Clinical investigations facilitated development of accurate case definition and guidance for laboratories on the optimum specimens and procedures for diagnoses. Currently, laboratory-based rtRT-PCR is the recommended test for diagnoses of acute cases to ensure patients can be identified and isolated and to facilitate the public health response. However, due to delays in diagnoses, severe shortage of tests and laboratory capacity, point-of-care molecular or antigen tests are becoming more attractive. Although serological tests are not suitable for diagnoses of acute cases, they are important to define epidemiological questions, including attack rate in the population, and to identify immune individuals. This review aimed to summarise the current available information for diagnoses of cases and to aid laboratories and healthcare workers to select the best assays and procedures."

3567,Mounting evidence for immunizing previously infected subjects with a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.,"Efforts to best protect the world from SARS-CoV-2 as variants emerge and despite limited vaccine supply are ongoing. One strategy that may maximize vaccine coverage and expedite immunization campaigns involves providing single mRNA vaccine doses to individuals with previous COVID-19. In this issue of the JCI, two independent studies, one by Levi and Azzolini et al. and another by Mazzoni and Di Lauria et al., explored vaccine responses in individuals previously infected with the virus. Levi and Azzolini and colleagues used multilinear regression models to correlate exposure and symptoms with antibody response to the vaccine. Mazzoni and Di Lauria and colleagues characterized B cell and T cell kinetics in whole blood after one and two doses of vaccine in health care workers with and without previous infection. Both studies indicated that one vaccine dose may sufficiently protect individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Implementing a single-dose mRNA vaccine protocol in previously symptomatic individuals may facilitate and expedite immunization campaigns."
3568,COVID-19 vaccination: Recommendations for management of patients with allergy or immune-based diseases.,"As South Africa continues to battle the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the imminent arrival of vaccines against COVID-19 offers hope. Vaccine roll-out has been accompanied by heightened media coverage that has created both excitement and anxiety, reporting on the shortened timeline of vaccine trials and approvals, as well as the recent series of anaphylaxis cases associated with the two approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Patients with allergic and other immune-based diseases are subgroups especially concerned about vaccine safety and efficacy. This practice guideline offers broad recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in various subgroups of allergic and immunebased disease, highlighting risk/benefit evaluation, and where and how routine vaccination should be altered."
