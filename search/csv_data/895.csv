8940,Detectable Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Human Breast Milk of a Mildly Symptomatic Patient With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus and causative pathogen to the pandemic illness COVID-19. Although RNA has been detected in various clinical samples, no reports to date have documented SARS-CoV-2 in human milk. This case report describes an actively breastfeeding patient with COVID-19 infection with detectable viral RNA in human milk."
8941,Single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces neutralising antibody and polyfunctional T-cell responses in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia.,"Patients receiving targeted cancer treatments such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been classified in the clinically extremely vulnerable group to develop severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), including patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) taking TKIs. In addition, concerns that immunocompromised individuals with solid and haematological malignancies may not mount an adequate immune response to a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine have been raised. In the present study, we evaluated humoral and cellular immune responses after a first injection of BNT162b2 vaccine in 16 patients with CML. Seroconversion and cellular immune response before and after vaccination were assessed. By day 21 after vaccination, anti-Spike immunoglobulin G was detected in 14/16 (87·5%) of the patients with CML and all developed a neutralising antibody response [serum dilution that inhibits 50% infection (ID50 ) >50], including medium (ID50 of 200-500) or high (ID50 of 501-2000) neutralising antibodies titres in nine of the 16 (56·25%) patients. T-cell response was seen in 14/15 (93·3%) evaluable patients, with polyfunctional responses seen in 12/15 (80%) patients (polyfunctional CD4+ response nine of 15, polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell response nine of 15). These data demonstrate the immunogenicity of a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine in most patients with CML, with both neutralising antibodies and polyfunctional T-cell responses seen in contrast to patients with solid tumour or lymphoid haematological malignancies."
8942,The interplay between inflammatory pathways and COVID-19: A critical review on pathogenesis and therapeutic options.,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerged as the deadliest outbreak that has now become a serious health issue to mankind. Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine storm are crucial factors that lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. Excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines leads to the dysregulation of the innate immune system. The cytokine storm attracts many inflammatory cells that infiltrate into the lung tissues and ultimately cause immune damage. In addition to the dysregulation of the immune system, dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) due to the downregulation of ACE2 is also associated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Both the mechanisms are directly or indirectly associated with cytokine storm that promotes vascular hyperpermeability, vascular edema leading to hypercoagulation and hence multiorgan damage. As of now, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19, but scientists have purposed several treatment options including cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, immunomodulators, plasma therapy, etc. In this article, we have provided the detailed mechanism of occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory storm and its connection with the pre-existing inflammatory conditions. Possible treatment options to cope up with the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are also discussed."
8943,[Epidemiological study design of asymptomatic infection of the 2019 novel coronavirus].,"COVID-19 is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). COVID-19 clinical cases are considered as the principal source of infection, however, asymptomatic cases may also play a role in the transmission. Significant gap exists in terms of the proportion or prevalence and transmissibility of asymptomatic cases. This study design plans to use data from areas with different epidemiological profiles to investigate the COVID-19 epidemic in China. In each selected region, both general community residents and key populations at high risk of COVID-19 infection, including recovered COVID-19 cases, close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, medical professionals, investigators at CDCs, and visitors to fever clinics, will be recruited and examined for viral RNA of 2019-nCoV and serum antibodies. Prevalence and characterization of asymptomatic cases will be determined, stratified by varied demographics and exposure risk. During the follow-up, the change in the serum antibodies will be studied prospectively in the symptomatic and asymptomatic cases to address the scientific and public health concerns of infectivity and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV."
8944,[COVID-19-associated coagulopathy].,"In 2020, infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread across the world to become a global pandemic. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a high rate of coagulopathy and thrombotic complications. The underlying mechanisms involved in these processes are complex. In addition to the low physical activity, blood coagulation activation accompanied by excessive immune/inflammatory reactions and vascular endothelialitis associated with the presence of intracellular SARS-CoV-2 and disrupted cell membranes contribute substantially to the complexity of the mechanisms. The types of thrombosis that occur include arterial thrombosis and venous thromboembolism. Microthrombi in alveolar capillaries are observed in COVID-19 patients. Considering the possible involvement of thrombosis in the worsening of COVID-19, prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, such as low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin, is essential for patients with moderate and severe infections. Even with prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, the incidence of thrombosis remains high. Consequently, control of the underlying inflammation and vascular endothelial protection may be required in combination with anticoagulant therapy."
8945,[COVID-19 and the central and peripheral nervous system].,"The health effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the infection of SARS-CoV‑2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) are becoming increasingly clear as the pandemic spreads. In addition to the lungs, other organs are also affected, which can significantly influence morbidity and mortality. In particular, neurological symptoms involving the central nervous system can lead to acute or long-term consequences. The mechanisms of this neuropathogenesis of SARS-CoV‑2 infection and its relation to acute and chronic neurological symptoms are the subject of current studies investigating a potential direct and indirect viral infection of the nervous system. The following review summarizes the current status of neuropathological manifestations, molecular pathogenesis, possible infection pathways in the nervous system, and systemic effects. In addition, an overview of the Germany-wide CNS-COVID19 registry and collaborations is presented, which should contribute to a better understanding of the neurological symptoms of COVID-19."
8946,Retrospective analysis of the first 50 emergency/elective surgical cases in terms of mortality and morbidity in CoVid-19 Pandemic Hospital in Istanbul.,"2019-nCoV currently named SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic Coronavirus identified in Wuhan China in December 2019. Turkey declared the first case relatively late compared to Asian and European countries on March 11, as the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Turkey. In this study, we aimed to determine patients' outcomes in 50 surgeries done in the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 in our hospital. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 50 patients who underwent surgeries during the incubation period of CoVid-19 at Istinye University Gaziosmanpasa Medical Park Hospital in Istanbul, from March 2 to April 11, 2020. Results: The age of 50 patients range was 21 to 73, and the median age was 43.32 (64%) patients were women. The median length of hospital stay is 2.6 days (1-21). Operations at various difficulty levels were also performed on patients with co-morbidities. No complication or mortality was observed except for 1 patient, and the ICU requirement of that patient was also due to high energy trauma. Conclusion: Although contrary claims have been made in various studies; it is the primary duty of us surgeons to operate CoVid-19 positive/suspicious patients safely and without any contamination, and on the other hand, to continue their operations without victimizing negative patients. In this pilot study, we would like to emphasize with necessary and adequate measures these can be achieved. Key words: CoVid-19, SARS-CoV-2, Surgery."

8948,Comprehensive overview of COVID-19 clinical trials.,"Here, we present an overview of the clinical trials that are currently being conducted or have concluded to date on COVID-19 globally. A comprehensive search was conducted to present 16 trial registries from around the world. Collectively, there are 1,528 trials reported for COVID-19 to date. Out of them, 50 studies included paediatric age group from day 0 to less than or equal to 18 years of age. A few 18 studies involve only females and 20 only males. There are 2 trials currently underway in Bangladesh, 4 in Pakistan and 13 in India. Overall, 940 trials are related to medicines and/or interventions. They include standard of care for any viral illness, antivirals, anti-inflammatory and immune altering medications. Two out of 10 vaccine trials are novel vaccines. It is knowledgeable and resourceful to reach out to the concerned sponsor if a physician thinks his patient can benefit from the trials in the region."
8949,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Genome Sequencing from Post-Mortem Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Lung Tissues.","Implementation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in the daily practice of pathology laboratories requires procedure adaptation to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. So far, one study reported the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing on FFPE tissues with only one contributory case of two. This study optimized SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing using the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Panel on 22 FFPE lung tissues from 16 deceased coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all FFPE blocks using a real-time RT-qPCR targeting the E gene with crossing point (Cp) values ranging from 16.02 to 34.16. Sequencing was considered as contributory (i.e. with a uniformity >55%) for 17 FFPE blocks. Adapting the number of target amplification PCR cycles according to the RT-qPCR Cp values allowed optimization of the sequencing quality for the contributory blocks (i.e. 20 PCR cycles for blocks with a Cp value <28 and 25 PCR cycles for blocks with a Cp value between 28 and 30). Most blocks with a Cp value >30 were non-contributory. Comparison of matched frozen and FFPE tissues revealed discordance for only three FFPE blocks, all with a Cp value >28. Variant identification and clade classification was possible for 13 patients. This study validates SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing on FFPE blocks and opens the possibility to explore correlation between virus genotype and histopathologic lesions."
