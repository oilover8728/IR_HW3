7770,Pangolins Harbor SARS-CoV-2-Related Coronaviruses.,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has posed a severe threat to global public health. Yet, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains mysterious. Several recent studies (e.g., Lam et al.,Xiao et al.) identified SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in pangolins, providing novel insights into the evolution and diversity of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses."
7771,Vaccination against COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Perception and Attitude of Healthcare Workers in COVID-dedicated Hospitals.,"Healthcare professionals are the crucial and influencing source of information for vaccines and their communication among patients and communities that can accelerate successful vaccination in a country. This cross-sectional study was one of the first and foremost ones in Bangladesh to observe the basic perception and attitudes towards vaccination against COVID-19 among the healthcare workers (HCWs) - doctors, interns, nurses, ward boys, cleaners, and medical technologists of major COVID-dedicated hospitals. The cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted in February 2021 among 550 HCWs to assess the perception and attitude towards vaccination against COVID-19. The study participants were targeted as the priority group for COVID-19 vaccination, working in two major COVID-dedicated hospitals, Holy Family Red Crescent Medical College Hospital (HF-center), and Sheikh Russel National Gastro-liver Institute and Hospital (SR-center) in Dhaka, Bangladesh during the pandemic. The questionnaire was structured with a three-point scale of responses from 'true', 'false', and 'do not know'. The responses were calculated on point-score as +1 for the correct response, -1 for the wrong response, and 0 for 'do not know' with an overall highest and the lowest possible score of +5 to -5. Absolute (n) and relative frequencies (%) were presented for qualitative variables, while quantitative variables were presented as mean (± standard deviation). Chi-square test was done for univariate analysis of qualitative variables and Student's t-test for quantitative variables. With the 95.27% response rate, including 204 males and 320 were female and the male: female ratio was 1: 1.56. The majority of the participants were doctors (45.8%) followed by nurses (27.9%), and MLSS (26.3%) respectively. The respondents were between 18 to 64 years of age with a mean of 36.17±10.94 years. Most of the respondents (95.99%) responded correctly about the cost-free availability of a vaccine against COVID-19 in the country, 87.40% preferred vaccination as safe and effective. Again 29.77% HCWs think the vaccine might not be safe or effective due to emergency authorization. Only 38.93% of respondents could respond correctly about the necessity of vaccines for children, 31.10% think the vaccination was not required instead of natural immunity. The positive perception and attitude of the frontline HCWs in COVID-dedicated hospitals in Bangladesh are crucial which will positively influence motivation and wide acceptance among the general population for the attainment of the nationwide vaccination program, and adopt effective strategic modification to minimize the gaps for a low-middle income country like Bangladesh with its resource constrain."
7772,How to perform a nasopharyngeal swab in adults and children in the COVID-19 era.,"The nasopharyngeal swab is currently the main testing method used to diagnose COVID-19. The principle is to collect respiratory cells infected by the virus and to use the RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) technique to detect the RNA of the virus. The false negative rate is high, about 30%, which can mainly be explained by an incorrect execution of the technique may increase the false negative rate and decrease the test's sensitivity. The aim of this note is to help healthcare providers to perform this test correctly in adults and children."
7773,The Combination of Bromelain and Acetylcysteine (BromAc) Synergistically Inactivates SARS-CoV-2.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the cause of a worldwide pandemic, currently with limited therapeutic options. The spike glycoprotein and envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2, containing disulfide bridges for stabilization, represent an attractive target as they are essential for binding to the ACE2 receptor in host cells present in the nasal mucosa. Bromelain and Acetylcysteine (BromAc) has synergistic action against glycoproteins by breakage of glycosidic linkages and disulfide bonds. We sought to determine the effect of BromAc on the spike and envelope proteins and its potential to reduce infectivity in host cells. Recombinant spike and envelope SARS-CoV-2 proteins were disrupted by BromAc. Spike and envelope protein disulfide bonds were reduced by Acetylcysteine. In in vitro whole virus culture of both wild-type and spike mutants, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a concentration-dependent inactivation from BromAc treatment but not from single agents. Clinical testing through nasal administration in patients with early SARS-CoV-2 infection is imminent."

7775,Essential functional molecules associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: Potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19.,"The whole world is still suffering substantially from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Several protein-based molecules that are associated with the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which are essential for its functionality, survival, and pathogenesis have been identified and are considered as potential therapeutic targets. These protein-based molecules are either structural/non-structural components of SARS-CoV-2 or host factors, which play a crucial role in this infection. Developing drug molecules against these essential functional molecules to hinder their regular functioning and associated physiological pathways could be promising for successful clinical management of this novel coronavirus infection. The review aims to highlight the functional molecules that play crucial roles in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. We have emphasized how these potential druggable targets could be beneficial in tackling the COVID-19 crisis."
7776,"COVID-19 Outbreaks in Correctional Facilities with Work-Release Programs - Idaho, July-November 2020.","As of April 16, 2021, U.S. correctional and detention facilities reported 399,631 cases of COVID-19 in incarcerated persons, resulting in 2,574 deaths (1). During July 14-November 30, 2020, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 382 persons incarcerated in Idaho correctional facilities with work-release programs. Work-release programs (which place incarcerated persons in community businesses) have social and economic benefits, but might put participants at increased risk for bidirectional transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The Idaho Department of Correction (IDOC) operates 13 state-run correctional facilities, including six low-security facilities dedicated to work-release programs. This report describes COVID-19 outbreaks in five IDOC facilities with work-release programs,* provides the mitigation strategies that IDOC implemented, and describes the collaborative public health response. As of November 30, 2020, 382 outbreak-related COVID-19 cases were identified among incarcerated persons in five Idaho correctional facilities with work-release programs; two outbreaks were linked to food processing plants. Mitigation strategies that helped to control outbreaks in IDOC facilities with work-release programs included isolation of persons with COVID-19, identification and quarantine of close contacts, mass testing of incarcerated persons and staff members, and temporary suspension of work-release programs. Implementation of public health recommendations for correctional and detention facilities with work-release programs, including mass testing and identification of high-risk work sites, can help mitigate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Incarcerated persons participating in work-release should be included in COVID-19 vaccination plans."
7777,Therapeutic opportunities of edible antiviral plants for COVID-19.,"The pandemic of Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that produces corona virus disease (COVID-19) has challenged the entire mankind by rapidly spreading globally in 210 countries affecting over 25 million people and about 1 million deaths worldwide. It continues to spread, afflicting the health system globally. So far there is no remedy for the ailment and the available antiviral regimens have been unsatisfactory for the clinical outcomes and the mode of treatment has been mainly supportive for the prevention of COVID-19-induced morbidity and mortality. From the time immortal the traditional plant-based ethno-medicines have provided the leads for the treatment of infectious diseases. Phytopharmaceuticals have provided potential and less toxic antiviral drugs as compared to conventional modern therapeutics which are associated with severe toxicities. The ethnopharmacological knowledge about plants has provided food supplements and nutraceuticals as a promise for prevention and treatment of the current pandemic. In this review article, we have attempted to comprehend the information about the edible medicinal plant materials with potential antiviral activity specifically against RNA virus which additionally possess property to improve immunity along with external and internal respiration and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties for the prevention and treatment of the disease. This will open an arena for the development of novel nutraceutical herbal formulations as an alternative therapy that can be used for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."
7778,Association between universal face shield in a quaternary care center and reduction of SARS-COV2 infections among healthcare personnel and hospitalized patients.,We implemented universal face shield use for all healthcare personnel upon entry to facility in order to counter an increase in SARS-COV2 cases among healthcare personnel and hospitalized patients. There was a marked reduction of infections in both healthcare personnel and hospitalized patients between pre and post intervention. Our results support universal face shield use as part of a multifaceted approach in areas of high SARS-COV2 community transmission.
7779,Public understanding of COVID-19 antibody testing and test results: A qualitative study conducted in the U.K. early in the pandemic.,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, antibody testing was proposed by several countries as a surveillance tool to monitor the spread of the virus and potentially to ease restrictions. In the UK, antibody testing originally formed the third pillar of the UK Government's COVID-19 testing programme and was thought to offer hope that those with a positive antibody test result could return to normal life. However, at that time scientists and the public had little understanding of the longevity of COVID-19 antibodies, and whether they provided immunity to reinfection or transmission of the virus. Objective: This paper explores the UK public's understanding of COVID-19 testing, perceived test accuracy, the meaning of a positive test result, willingness to adhere to restrictive measures in response to an antibody test result and how they expect other people to respond. Methods: On-line synchronous focus groups were conducted in April/May 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic and the most stringent period of the COVID-19 restrictive measures. Data were analysed thematically. Results: There was confusion in responses as to whether those with a positive or negative test should return to work and which restrictive measures would apply to them or their household members. Participants raised concerns about the wider public response to positive antibody test results and the adverse behavioural effects. There were worries that antibody tests could create a divided society particularly if those with a positive test result were given greater freedoms or chose to disregard the restrictive measures. Conclusion: Should these tests be offered more widely, information should be developed in consultation with the public to ensure clarity and address uncertainty about test results and subsequent behaviours."
