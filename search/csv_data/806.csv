8051,Emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as of June 2021.,"In December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the resulting pandemic has caused widespread health problems and social and economic disruption. Thus far in 2021, more than 4 million people worldwide have died from COVID-19, so safe and efficacious vaccines are urgently needed to restore normal economic and social activities. According to the official guidance documents of the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccines based on four major strategies including mRNA, adenoviral vectors, inactivated viruses, and recombinant proteins have entered the stage of emergency use authorization and pre-certification evaluation. The current review summarizes these vaccines and it looks ahead to the development of additional COVID-19 vaccines in the future."

8053,Potential for elimination of SAR-CoV-2 through vaccination as inspired by elimination of multiple influenza viruses through natural pandemics or mass vaccination.,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has claimed many lives worldwide. To combat the pandemic, multiple types of vaccines are under development with unprecedented rapidity. Theoretically, future vaccination against COVID-19 may fall into long-term costly guerrilla warfare between SARS-CoV-2 and humans. Elimination of SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination to avoid the potential long-term costly guerrilla warfare, if possible, is highly desired and worth intensive consideration. Human influenza pandemics emerging in 1957, 1968, and 2009 established strong global herd immunity and led to the elimination of three human influenza viruses, which circulated worldwide for years before the pandemics. Moreover, both clade 7.2 of subtype H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and subtype H7N9 avian influenza virus circulated in poultry in China for years, and they have been virtually eliminated through mass vaccination in recent years. These facts suggest that the rapid establishment of global herd immunity through mass vaccination using an appropriate vaccine could eliminate SARS-CoV-2. The coming 2 years are a golden time for elimination through vaccination, which requires tremendous national and international collaboration. This review also prioritizes the efficacy of vaccines for COVID-19 and elucidates the importance of the development of more live vaccines for COVID-19."

8056,Chest computed tomography (CT) features in children with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19: A systematic review.,"To describe the chest CT features reported in children with confirmed COVID-19 infection, published in English literature. A systematic review was completed on PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases on the 1st of June 2020 using the PICO strategy. The NIH Quality Assessment Tool was used to assess the quality of the selected articles. The systematic review was evaluated by Case Series Studies and the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA). The extracted data were assessed and compared with those reported in the adult population. Seventy-two articles were retrieved from the database search and screened by the title, abstract and keywords. Eleven articles were deemed eligible for full-text assessment. Nine articles were included for the data extraction and in the final analysis. Chest CT features in children with COVID-19 differ from those in adults. 'Ground-grass opacities' (GGOs) are the most commonly described abnormalities, but closely followed by a combination of GGO and consolidation, not usual in adults. Children tend to have a more variable involvement than the subpleural and posterior and basal topography described in adults. Interlobular thickening and air bronchogram found in adults with COVID-19 are not frequent in children. Pulmonary embolism reported in up to 30% of adults has not been yet reported in children. Original articles describing chest CT features in children with COVID-19 in the English literature are limited to small populations of Chinese children. Chest CT imaging features are very diverse across the selected studies and globally different from those reported in adults. Data from children of different countries would provide a more comprehensive description of chest CT features in children with COVID-19."
8057,Molecular mechanisms of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and potential anti-COVID19 pharmacological targets since the outbreak of the pandemic.,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a severe threat against public health and global economies. COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, is highly contagious and has led to an ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 affects, mainly, the respiratory system, with most severe cases primarily showcasing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, no targeted therapy exists, and since the number of infections and death toll keeps rising, it has become a necessity to study possible therapeutic targets. Antiviral drugs can target various stages of the viral infection, and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, both structural and non-structural proteins have been proposed as potential drug targets. This review focuses on the most researched SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their structure, function, and possible therapeutic approaches."

8059,Potential Inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 and Functional Food Components as Nutritional Supplement for COVID-19: A Review.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome is a viral respiratory infection and commonly called as COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It widely transmitted through direct or indirect contact. Currently, no specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 are available; only prevention and supportive strategy are the preventive measures. The present review emphasizes the latest research related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the current status of potential inhibitors identified. Recent interest in SARS-CoV-2 has focused on transmission, symptoms, structure, and its structural proteins that exhibit promising therapeutics targets for rapid identification of potential inhibitors. The quick identification of potential inhibitors and immune-boosting functional food ingredients are crucial to combat this pandemic disease. We also tried to give an overview of the functional food components as a nutritional supplement, which helps in boosting our immune system and could be useful in preventing the COVID-19 and/or to improve the outcome during therapy."
