9910,Clinical Properties and Diagnostic Methods of COVID-19 Infection in Pregnancies: Meta-Analysis.,"We aimed to summarize reliable medical evidence by the meta-analysis of all published retrospective studies that examined data based on the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by clinical symptoms, molecular (RT-PCR) diagnosis, and characteristic CT imaging features in pregnant women. The MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, ClinicalKey, and CINAHL databases were used to select the studies. Then, 384 articles were received, including the studies until 01/May/2020. As a result of the full-text evaluation, 12 retrospective articles covering all the data related were selected. A total of 181 pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infections were included in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, the incidence of fever was 38.1% (95% CI: 14.2-65%) and cough was 22% (95% CI: 10.8-35.2%) among all clinical features of pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, fever and cough are the most common symptoms in pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 91.8% (95% CI: 76.7-99.9%) of RT-PCR results are positive. Moreover, abnormal CT incidence is 97.9% (95% CI: 94.2-99.9%) positive. No case was death. However, as this virus spreads globally, it should not be overlooked that the incidence will increase in pregnant women and maybe in the risky group. RT-PCR and CT can be used together in an accurate and safe diagnosis. In conclusion, these findings will provide important guidance for current studies regarding the clinical features and correct detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women, as well as whether it will create emergency tables that will require the use of a viral drug."
9911,[Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 patients].,"Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Plasma of 200-400 mL was collected from convalescent patients 2 weeks after being discharged from the hospital. After viral nucleic acid testing and antibody testing, the plasma was infused into 16 severe or critical COVID-19 patients. Time for viral nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative, total volume of plasma transfusion, average antibody concentration, and total antibody amount were recorded. White blood cell (WBC) counts, lymphocyte (LYM) counts, neutrophil (NEU) counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), hypersensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and lactic acid (Lac) levels were measured and the rate of change was calculated at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3) after transfusion. Results: (1) Patient characteristics: among the 16 patients, 5 cases (31.25%) were severe COVID-19, and 11 cases (68.75%) were critical COVID-19; 62.50% (10/16) of the patients had primary disease; the percentage of invasive ventilation and use of extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation (ECMO) in critical patients were 90.91% (10/11) and 45.46% (5/11) respectively. (2) Antibody concentration of convalescent plasma and time for NAA test turning negative: the convalescent plasma antibody concentration in this study was ranged from 10.93 kAU/L to 114.7 kAU/L, with an average value of (56.44±39.40) kAU/L. NAA test was continuously positive before plasma transfusion in 10 patients, and the time for NAA test turning negative could be counted. Eight patients turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion. Severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative than critical patients after transfusion [2 (2-3) vs. 5 (3-8), P = 0.036]. Two critical patients transfused plasma with lower antibody concentration remained a positive result of NAA test, and died on the 3rd and 6th day respectively. (3) Laboratory results: the change rates of WBC (0.81±0.28 vs. 1.00) and NEU (0.75±0.33 vs. 1.00) were significantly decreased at d1 after convalescent plasma treatment (both P < 0.05), and the CRP level decreased to about 63% of that before transfusion (P = 0.017). No adverse events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion. Conclusions: Viral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion, and the turning time of severe patients was shorter than that of critical patients. Convalescent plasma therapy can reduce the patients' CRP level, and no adverse events were found during the treatment. The antibody concentration in the convalescent plasma may be one of the factors that affect the time for the nucleic acid turning negative after transfusion. Detection and screening convalescent plasma of high-titer antibody and early application to severe and critical patients are expected to improve the efficacy of convalescent plasma."
9912,Subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis following COVID-19 vaccination: a case of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA).,"Vaccination injection site adverse reactions are usually mild and transient, and post-vaccination musculoskeletal symptoms, such as myalgia and arthralgia, are very common. Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA), defined as shoulder pain and limited range of motion occurring after the administration of a vaccine intended for intramuscular administration in the upper arm, is a well-established condition in the medical literature, yet underreported. In such cases, subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis may occur, leading to shoulder dysfunction and ongoing pain. Millions of doses of vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 have been administered to adults worldwide during the pandemic. We report a case of subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis after COVID-19 vaccination, related to the unintentional injection of vaccine solution into the bursa resulting in a robust immune-mediated inflammatory reaction."
9913,Bilateral Multifocal Choroiditis following COVID-19 Vaccination.,"Purpose: To report a case of bilateral choroiditis following COVID-19 vaccination.Study Design: Case report.Results: A 34-year old male presented with visual loss one week after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Examination showed large serous detachment of the macula in the right eye and severe choroidal thickening noted on ultrasonography in both eyes. The patient's condition improved rapidly with oral corticosteroids with significant resolution of the serous detachments within two weeks of initiating treatment and complete visual recovery subsequently.Conclusions: The onset of ocular symptoms starting within one week following vaccination suggests an inflammatory or autoimmune response to the vaccine. Ophthalmologists should consider the option of autoimmune and other inflammatory ocular problems, which may manifest as uveitis, following COVID-19 vaccination. Timely diagnosis and treatment with corticosteroids can result in good visual and structural outcome."
9914,Pregnancy and childbirth during the coronavirus pandemic - current stage of knowledge.,"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), is a new strain of β-coronavirus. At the time of the current pandemic, pregnant women fear of infection by this pathogen and related consequences both for themselves and for their children. Adaptive changes occurring in the body of a pregnant woman can increase her susceptibility to infections, especially when it concerns the cardiopulmonary system. Clinical data relating to infection by this pathogen, referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant women are still limited. Most of the cases in which these data are available apply to the third trimester of pregnancy. This article provides an overview of a current knowledge and recommendations regarding the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and its impact on the pregnancy outcome."
9915,Digestive system manifestations and clinical significance of coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic literature review.,"Background and aim: A worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has drawn global attention. Several reports have described the gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in the infected patients. The systematic review was designed to highlight the gaps in our knowledge about the prevalence and clinical significance of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched PubMed database and Google articles published in both English and Chinese up to June 3, 2020, using search terms ""clinical features,"" ""2019 novel coronavirus,"" ""2019-nCoV,"" ""COVID-19,"" or ""SARS-Cov-2."" Observational studies, case reports, or letters describing the clinical features or observational studies regarding the detection and/or isolation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viruses in stools were included. Results: A total of 22 publications were finally selected. It was reported that GI symptoms occurred in about 3-40.7% of patients. GI manifestations included nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, belching, abdominal distension, and GI hemorrhage. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom. Infected patients had various degrees of liver dysfunction, and the severity of liver dysfunction was significantly associated with the severity of the disease. Therapy focusing on digestive system like liver supportive therapy or nutrition support or probiotics has been demonstrated to be effective interventions, which greatly improve prognosis. Fecal-oral transmission route is a potential risk for transmission. Conclusions: GI symptoms are common in COVID-19. Strengthening the recognition on abnormalities in digestive system of patients with COVID-19 is crucial for early identification and timely treatment, especially for those atypical patients. Hygiene protection and keeping the drainpipe free flowing are necessary for everyone."

9918,Lung Ultrasound May Support Diagnosis and Monitoring of COVID-19 Pneumonia.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is characterized by severe pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome in about 20% of infected patients. Computed tomography (CT) is the routine imaging technique for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia. Chest CT has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, but is not universally available, requires an infected or unstable patient to be moved to the radiology unit with potential exposure of several people, necessitates proper sanification of the CT room after use and is underutilized in children and pregnant women because of concerns over radiation exposure. The increasing frequency of confirmed COVID-19 cases is striking, and new sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to guide clinical practice. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging non-invasive bedside technique that is used to diagnose interstitial lung syndrome through evaluation and quantitation of the number of B-lines, pleural irregularities and nodules or consolidations. In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, LUS reveals a typical pattern of diffuse interstitial lung syndrome, characterized by multiple or confluent bilateral B-lines with spared areas, thickening of the pleural line with pleural line irregularity and peripheral consolidations. LUS has been found to be a promising tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and LUS findings correlate fairly with those of chest CT scan. Compared with CT, LUS has several other advantages, such as lack of exposure to radiation, bedside repeatability during follow-up, low cost and easier application in low-resource settings. Consequently, LUS may decrease utilization of conventional diagnostic imaging resources (CT scan and chest X-ray). LUS may help in early diagnosis, therapeutic decisions and follow-up monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the critical care setting and in pregnant women, children and patients in areas with high rates of community transmission."
9919,The origin and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe.,"The investigation of migratory patterns during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic before spring 2020 border closures in Europe is a crucial first step toward an in-depth evaluation of border closure policies. Here we analyze viral genome sequences using a phylodynamic model with geographic structure to estimate the origin and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe prior to border closures. Based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reconstruct a partial transmission tree of the early pandemic and coinfer the geographic location of ancestral lineages as well as the number of migration events into and between European regions. We find that the predominant lineage spreading in Europe during this time has a most recent common ancestor in Italy and was probably seeded by a transmission event in either Hubei, China or Germany. We do not find evidence for preferential migration paths from Hubei into different European regions or from each European region to the others. Sustained local transmission is first evident in Italy and then shortly thereafter in the other European regions considered. Before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate that the rate of occurrence of new cases from within-country transmission was within the bounds of the estimated rate of new cases from migration. In summary, our analysis offers a view on the early state of the epidemic in Europe and on migration patterns of the virus before border closures. This information will enable further study of the necessity and timeliness of border closures."
