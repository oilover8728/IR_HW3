1410,SARS-CoV-2 genomics: An Indian perspective on sequencing viral variants.,"Since its emergence as a pneumonia-like outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has spread widely to become a global pandemic. The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020 and since then it has affected more than ten million people and resulted in around 150,000 deaths in the country. Over time, the viral genome has accumulated mutations as it passes through its human hosts, a common evolutionary mechanism found in all microorganisms. This has implications for disease surveillance and management, vaccines and therapeutics, and the emergence of reinfections. Sequencing the viral genome can help monitor these changes and provides an extraordinary opportunity to understand the genetic epidemiology and evolution of the virus as well as tracking its spread in a population. Here we review the past year in the context of the phylogenetic analysis of variants isolated over the course of the pandemic in India and highlight the importance of continued sequencing-based surveillance in the country."
1411,"Validation of a single-step, single-tube reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.","Introduction. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 has resulted in unparalleled requirements for RNA extraction kits and enzymes required for virus detection, leading to global shortages. This has necessitated the exploration of alternative diagnostic options to alleviate supply chain issues.Aim. To establish and validate a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT- LAMP) assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs.Methodology. We used a commercial RT-LAMP mastermix from OptiGene in combination with a primer set designed to detect the CDC N1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene. A single-tube, single-step fluorescence assay was implemented whereby 1 µl of universal transport medium (UTM) directly from a nasopharyngeal swab could be used as template, bypassing the requirement for RNA purification. Amplification and detection could be conducted in any thermocycler capable of holding 65 °C for 30 min and measure fluorescence in the FAM channel at 1 min intervals.Results. Assay evaluation by assessment of 157 clinical specimens previously screened by E-gene RT-qPCR revealed assay sensitivity and specificity of 87 and 100%, respectively. Results were fast, with an average time-to-positive (Tp) for 93 clinical samples of 14 min (sd±7 min). Using dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into UTM, we also evaluated assay performance against FDA guidelines for implementation of emergency-use diagnostics and established a limit-of-detection of 54 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50 per ml (TCID50 ml-1), with satisfactory assay sensitivity and specificity. A comparison of 20 clinical specimens between four laboratories showed excellent interlaboratory concordance; performing equally well on three different, commonly used thermocyclers, pointing to the robustness of the assay.Conclusion. With a simplified workflow, The N1 gene Single Tube Optigene LAMP assay (N1-STOP-LAMP) is a powerful, scalable option for specific and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and an additional resource in the diagnostic armamentarium against COVID-19."
1412,High-Throughput Transcription-mediated amplification on the Hologic Panther is a highly sensitive method of detection for SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: As the demand for laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 increases, additional varieties of testing methodologies are being considered. While real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has performed as the main method for virus detection, other methods are becoming available, including transcription mediated amplification (TMA). The Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay utilizes TMA as a target amplification mechanism, and it has only recently received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Objectives: We sought to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay to RTPCR as a means of SARS-CoV-2 detection in a diagnostic setting. Study design: We performed a limit-of-detection study (LoD) to assess the analytical sensitivity of TMA and RT-PCR. This preceded a comparison of the methods using previously evaluated clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs) using 116 human specimens tested by both methodologies. Specimens included sixty-one (61) specimens found reactive by real-time PCR, fifty-one (51) found non-reactive, and four (4) deemed inconclusive. Results: The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay showed a markedly higher analytical sensitivity than RT-PCR by LoD study. Evaluation of clinical specimens resulted in fewer inconclusive results by the SARS-CoV-2 assay, leading to potentially higher clinical sensitivity. Conclusions: Higher analytical sensitivity may explain TMA's ability to ascertain for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in human specimens deemed inconclusive by real-time PCR. TMA provides an effective, highly sensitive means of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens."
1413,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers of a teaching hospital in Belgium: self-reported occupational and household risk factors for seropositivity.,"This study aims to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among health care workers (HCWs) and to assess self-reported risk factors for seropositivity. A total of 3255 HCWs were included and the overall seroprevalence was 7.8%. The likelihood of seropositivity was higher in participants reporting any COVID-19 symptoms within the last 4 months (OR 8.32, 95% CI 5.83-11.88, P < 0.001). Being a female HCW (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11-2.32, P < 0.01), having a cohabitant who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.78-3.66 P < 0.001) or a cohabitant who was a nursing home caregiver (OR 3.71, 95% CI 1.59-8.65, P = 0.002) were independently associated with an increased risk of seropositivity. Working in a COVID-19 unit (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.21-2.23, P < 0.001) and being exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 infected co-worker (OR 1.30,95% CI 0.97-1.74, P = 0.016) resulted in higher seropositivity rate. Even if in-hospital exposure may play a significant role, increased infection risk is most likely attributable to household contact."
1414,An Overview of the Temporal Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Clinical Specimens.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 quickly spread in China and has, since March 2020 become a pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. The causative agent was promptly isolated and named SARS-CoV-2. Scientific efforts are related to identifying the best clinical management of these patients, but also in understanding their infectivity in order to limit the spread of the virus. Aimed at identifying viral RNA in the various compartments of the organism of sick subjects, diagnostic tests are carried out. However, the accuracy of such tests varies depending on the type of specimen used and the time of illness at which they are performed. This review of the literature aims to summarize the preliminary findings reported in studies on Covid-19 testing. The results highlight how the pharyngeal swab is highly sensitive in the first phase of the disease, while in the advanced stages, other specimens should be considered, such as sputum, or even stool to detect SARS-CoV-2. It highlights that most patients already reach the peak of the viral load in the upper airways within the first days of displaying symptoms, which thereafter tend to decrease. This suggests that many patients may already be infectious before symptoms start to appear."
1415,Nose-pharyngeal swabs as a screening test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with scheduled elective surgery: the experience of the Hygiene Service of the Local Health Authority Roma 1.,"The COVID-19 (COrona Virus Disease 2019), due to the SARS-COV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2) has been an unprecedented global challenge for the healthcare systems (1)."
1416,First Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay in Pleural Fluid.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection due to the spread of a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), resulting in a wide range of clinical features, from asymptomatic carriers to ARDS. The gold standard for diagnosis is nucleic acid detection by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swabs. However, due to limitations in this technique's sensitivity, thoracic imaging plays a crucial, complementary role in diagnostic evaluation and also allows for detection of atypical findings and potential alternative targets for sampling (eg, pleural effusion). Although less common, pleural involvement has been described in a minority of patients. This report describes the first case of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pleural fluid obtained by means of ultrasound-guided thoracentesis, and its main characteristics are detailed. Pleural effusion is not a common finding in COVID-19 infection, but a prompt recognition of this potential localization may be useful to optimize diagnostic evaluation as well as the management of these patients."
1417,COVID-19 molecular level laboratory diagnoses.,"AbstractAIMS: Aims: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused not only global pandemic, but it also pointed at unprepared health care systems and countermeasures were introduced under the pressure of urgent circumstances. This review is focused on discussion and critical evaluation of instrumental tools for COVID-19 diagnosis that were developed in the last months. Methods: Survey of actual literature and scientific reports was made. The most substantial analytical and diagnostical methods were identified and described. Principles and limitations of the methods are described, and actual papers are cited in this review. Results: Analytical and diagnostical methods like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP), Lateral Flow Immunochromatography Assay (LFIA), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), biosensors and ChemiLuminescence ImmunoAssay (CLIA) are discussed for assay of viral particles, antigens and specific host antibodies in blood, serum, plasma, nasopharyngeal swab and other samples in order to diagnose COVID-19. Conclusions: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease that has spread over the world since the end of year 2019. The global epidemic pointed at the necessity to introduce sensitive methods for instrumental diagnosis of COVID-19 and distinguishing it from the other viral diseases. (Tab. 2, Ref. 96)."

1419,Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 testing for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 during the initial stages of a global pandemic.,"Accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is essential to guide prevention and control of COVID-19. Here we examine SARS-CoV-2 molecular-based test performance characteristics and summarize case-level data related to COVID-19 diagnosis. From January 11 through April 22, 2020, Public Health Ontario conducted SARS-CoV-2 testing of 86,942 specimens collected from 80,354 individuals, primarily using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods. We analyzed test results across specimen types and for individuals with multiple same-day and multi-day collected specimens. Nasopharyngeal compared to throat swabs had a higher positivity (8.8% vs. 4.8%) and an adjusted estimate 2.9 Ct lower (SE = 0.5, p<0.001). Same-day specimens showed high concordance (98.8%), and the median Ct of multi-day specimens increased over time. Symptomatic cases had rRT-PCR results with an adjusted estimate 3.0 Ct (SE = 0.5, p<0.001) lower than asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases. Overall test sensitivity was 84.6%, with a negative predictive value of 95.5%. Molecular testing is the mainstay of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and testing protocols will continue to be dynamic and iteratively modified as more is learned about this emerging pathogen."
