1960,Clinical characteristics of hospitalized mild/moderate COVID-19 patients with a prolonged negative conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection.,"Background: The impact of COVID-19 has been devastating on a global scale. The negative conversion time (NCT) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is closely related to clinical manifestation and disease progression in COVID-19 patients. Our study aimed to predict factors associated with prolonged NCT of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in mild/moderate COVID-19 patients. Methods: The clinical features, laboratory data and treatment outcomes of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Then univariate and multivariate analysis were used to screen out risk factors of influencing prolonged NCT of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results: Thirty-two hospitalized mild/moderate COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The general clinical symptoms were cough (78.1%), fever (75%), diarrhea (68.8%), expectoration (56.3%), and nausea (37.5%). More than 40% of the patients had decreased erythrocyte, hemoglobin and leucocyte and 93.8% patients were detected in abnormalities of chest CT. The median NCT of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 19.5 days (IQR: 14.25-25). Univariate analysis found fever, nausea, diarrhea and abnormalities in chest CTs were positively associated with prolonged NCT of viral RNA (P< 0.05). The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model revealed that fever [Exp (B), 0.284; 95% CI, 0.114-0.707; P<0.05] and nausea [Exp (B), 0.257; 95%CI, 0.096-0.689; P<0.05] were two significant independent factors. Conclusions: Fever and nausea were two significant independent factors in prolonged NCT of viral RNA in mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, which provided a useful references for disease progression and treatment of COVID-19."
1961,Available COVID-19 serial seroconversion panel for validation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays.,"Seroconversion panels are an important tool for investigating antibody responses and developing serological assays. A seroconversion panel was generated from a single SARS-CoV-2 positive plasma donor over 87 days. This seroconversion panel was tested against 6 SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests (IgG, IgM, and total Ig). All test kits utilized recombinant antigens that are specific to SARS-CoV-2. The seroconversion panel showed IgG responses for SARS-CoV-2 after day 50. IgM levels peaked on day 50 (prior to IgG) and declined in subsequent samples. This seroconversion panel is a useful tool for validation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays."

1964,Streamlining SARS-CoV-2 confirmatory testing to reduce false positive results.,"Background: Confirmatory testing of SARS-CoV-2 results is essential to reduce false positives, but comes at a cost of significant extra workload for laboratories and increased turnaround time. A balance must be sought. We analysed our confirmatory testing pathway to produce a more refined approach in preparation for rising case numbers. Methods: Over a 10-week low prevalence period we performed confirmatory testing on all newly positive results. Turnaround time was measured and results were analysed to identify a threshold that could be applied as a cut-off for future confirmatory testing and reduce overall workload for the laboratory. Results: Between 22/06/20 and 31/08/20 confirmatory testing was performed on 108 newly positive samples, identifying 32 false positive results (30 %). Turnaround time doubled, increasing by an extra 17 h. There was a highly statistically significant difference between initial Relative Light Unit (RLU) of results that confirmed compared to those that did not, 1176 vs 721 (P < 0.00001). RLU = 1000 was identified as a suitable threshold for confirmatory testing in our laboratory: with RLU â‰¥ 1000, 55/56 (98 %) confirmed as positive, whereas with RLU < 1000 only 12/38 (32 %) confirmed. Conclusions: False positive SARS-CoV-2 tests can be identified by confirmatory testing, yet this may significantly delay results. Establishing a threshold for confirmatory testing streamlines this process to focus only on samples where it is most required. We advise all laboratories to follow a similar process to identify thresholds that trigger confirmatory testing for their own assays, increasing accuracy while maintaining efficiency for when case numbers are high."
1965,"Evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test for Detection of Antibody in Human, Canine, Cat, and Hamster Sera.","Surrogate neutralization assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that can be done without biosafety level 3 containment and in multiple species are desirable. We evaluate a recently developed surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) in comparison to 90% plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT90) in human, canine, cat, and hamster sera. With PRNT90 as the reference, sVNT had sensitivity of 98.9% and specificity of 98.8%. Using a panel of immune sera corresponding to other coronaviruses, we confirm the lack of cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses in SARS-CoV-2 sVNT and PRNT90, except for cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-1 in sVNT."

The SARS-CoV-2 crossed borders and quickly transformed into a ""Public health emergency of international concern"". Countries around the globe are in the race to achieve herd immunity. We describe the steps taken by Saudi Arabia to achieve this goal."

1969,Computational drug repurposing for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors.,"Accepted 7 July 2020ABSTRACTSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the known COVID-19 disease. Since currently no definitive therapies or vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are available, there is an urgent need to identify effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of the best-known targets available is the main protease of this virus, crucial for the processing of polyproteins codified by viral RNA. In this work, we used a computational virtual screening procedure for the repurposing of commercial drugs available in the DrugBank database as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Molecular docking calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been applied. The computational model was validated through a self-docking procedure. The screening procedure highlighted five interesting drugs that showed a comparable or higher docking score compared to the crystallographic compound and maintained the protein binding during the MD runs. Amongst these drugs, Ritonavir has been used in clinical trials with patients affected by COVID-19 and Nelfinavir showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The five identified drugs could be evaluated experimentally as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease in view of a possible COVID-19 treatment. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
