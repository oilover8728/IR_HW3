2400,Safety of mRNA-Based Vaccines for SARS CoV-2.,"SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 100 million people, causing 2 million deaths globally. Studies on the development of a vaccine ended up with different formulations. We herein discuss the safety record of the two approved vaccines."
2401,A Risk-Based Screening Approach to Patients Needing Surgery During the De-Escalation Phase of COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, many national and international surgical societies have produced guidelines regarding the management of surgical patients. During the mitigation phase of the pandemic, most documents suggested to consider postponing elective procedures, unless this might have impacted the life expectancy of patients. As awareness and knowledge about COVID-19 are gradually increasing, and as we enter a phase when surgical services are resuming their activities, surgical strategies have to adapt to this rapidly evolving scenario. This is particularly relevant when considering screening policies and the associated findings. We herein describe a risk-based approach to the management of patients with surgical diseases, which might be useful in order to limit the risks for healthcare workers and patients, while allowing for resuming elective surgical practice safely."
2402,Comparison of Four Molecular In Vitro Diagnostic Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasopharyngeal Specimens.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first discovered in December 2019 as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fairly nonspecific, and symptoms overlap those of other seasonal respiratory infections concurrently circulating in the population. Furthermore, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically. To support infection control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-19-positive patients. In the present study, we evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of the following four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted emergency use authorization by the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients: the New York SARS-CoV-2 Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel (modified CDC) assay, the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (Diasorin Molecular) assay, GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 (GenMark) assay, and the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 (Hologic) assay. This information is crucial for both laboratories and clinical teams as decisions on which testing platform to implement are made."
2403,Development of a Broadly Applicable Cas12a-Linked Beam Unlocking Reaction for Sensitive and Specific Detection of Respiratory Pathogens Including SARS-CoV-2.,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide threat to public health. COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop clinical symptoms that are often confused with the infections of other respiratory pathogens. Sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the ability to discriminate from other viruses is urgently needed for COVID-19 diagnosis. Herein, we streamlined a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas12a-based nucleic acid detection platform, termed Cas12a-linked beam unlocking reaction (CALIBURN). We show that CALIBURN could detect SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses and influenza viruses with little cross-reactivity. Importantly, CALIBURN allowed accurate diagnosis of clinical samples with extremely low viral loads, which is a major obstacle for the clinical applications of existing CRISPR diagnostic platforms. When tested on the specimens from SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative donors, CALIBURN exhibited 73.0% positive and 19.0% presumptive positive rates and 100% specificity. Moreover, unlike existing CRISPR detection methods that were mainly restricted to respiratory specimens, CALIBURN displayed consistent performance across both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, suggesting its broad specimen compatibility. Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrated that CALIBURN allowed detection of coexisting pathogens without cross-reactivity from a single tissue specimen. Our results suggest that CALIBURN can serve as a versatile platform for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases."
2404,Current approaches in laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2.,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has rapidly spread to produce a global pandemic. It is now clear that person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been occurring and that the virus has been dramatically growing in recent months. Early, rapid and accurate diagnosis is of great significance for curtailing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. There are currently several diagnostic techniques (e.g. viral culture and nucleic acid amplification test) being used to detect the virus. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are quite different, with the sample source and detection limit varying greatly. This study reviewed all types and characteristics of the currently available laboratory diagnostic assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and summarized the selection strategies of testing and sampling sites at different disease stages to improve the diagnostic accuracy of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
2405,COVID-19 and vaccination rollout in Fiji: Challenges caused by digital platform.,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, a variety of interventions have reduced SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and mortality, including individual precautions such as wearing proper personal protective equipment (i.e., hand gloves, facemasks, and face shields), social distancing, handwashing, and limiting interpersonal interaction to outside situations. The most promising hope for ending the COVID-19 pandemic is the successful launch of COVID-19 vaccines. In response, this letter to editor will disclose the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination and challenges caused by digital platforms in Fiji."
2406,"Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation, Navarre, Spain, January to April 2021.","COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness was evaluated in close contacts of cases diagnosed during January-April 2021. Among 20,961 contacts, 7,240 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed, with 5,467 being symptomatic and 559 leading to hospitalisations. Non-brand-specific one and two dose vaccine effectiveness were respectively, 35% (95% confidence interval (CI): 25 to 44) and 66% (95% CI: 57 to 74) against infections, 42% (95% CI: 31 to 52) and 82% (95% CI: 74 to 88) against symptomatic infection, and 72% (95% CI: 47 to 85) and 95% (95% CI: 62 to 99) against COVID-19 hospitalisation. The second dose significantly increased effectiveness. Findings support continuing complete vaccination."
2407,"Pilot Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 Secondary Transmission in Kindergarten Through Grade 12 Schools Implementing Mitigation Strategies - St. Louis County and City of Springfield, Missouri, December 2020.","Many kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) schools offering in-person learning have adopted strategies to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). These measures include mandating use of face masks, physical distancing in classrooms, increasing ventilation with outdoor air, identification of close contacts,* and following CDC isolation and quarantine guidance† (2). A 2-week pilot investigation was conducted to investigate occurrences of SARS-CoV-2 secondary transmission in K-12 schools in the city of Springfield, Missouri, and in St. Louis County, Missouri, during December 7-18, 2020. Schools in both locations implemented COVID-19 mitigation strategies; however, Springfield implemented a modified quarantine policy permitting student close contacts aged ≤18 years who had school-associated contact with a person with COVID-19 and met masking requirements during their exposure to continue in-person learning.§ Participating students, teachers, and staff members with COVID-19 (37) from 22 schools and their school-based close contacts (contacts) (156) were interviewed, and contacts were offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Among 102 school-based contacts who received testing, two (2%) had positive test results indicating probable school-based SARS-CoV-2 secondary transmission. Both contacts were in Springfield and did not meet criteria to participate in the modified quarantine. In Springfield, 42 student contacts were permitted to continue in-person learning under the modified quarantine; among the 30 who were interviewed, 21 were tested, and none received a positive test result. Despite high community transmission, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies was lower than that in the community. Until additional data are available, K-12 schools should continue implementing CDC-recommended mitigation measures (2) and follow CDC isolation and quarantine guidance to minimize secondary transmission in schools offering in-person learning."
2408,A dried blood spot protocol for high throughput analysis of SARS-CoV-2 serology based on the Roche Elecsys anti-N assay.,"Background: Since 2020 SARS-CoV-2 spreads pandemically, infecting more than 119 million people, causing >2·6 million fatalities. Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary greatly, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Different populations react differently to the disease, making it very hard to track the spread of the infection in a population. Measuring specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is an important tool to assess the spread of the infection or successful vaccinations. To achieve sufficient sample numbers, alternatives to venous blood sampling are needed not requiring medical personnel or cold-chains. Dried-blood-spots (DBS) on filter-cards have been used for different studies, but not routinely for serology. Methods: We developed a semi-automated protocol using self-sampled DBS for SARS-CoV-2 serology. It was validated in a cohort of matched DBS and venous-blood samples (n = 1710). Feasibility is demonstrated with two large serosurveys with 10247 company employees and a population cohort of 4465 participants. Findings: Sensitivity and specificity reached 99·20% and 98·65%, respectively. Providing written instructions and video tutorials, 99·87% (4465/4471) of the unsupervised home sampling DBS cards could be analysed. Interpretation: DBS-sampling is a valid and highly reliable tool for large scale serosurveys. We demonstrate feasibility and accuracy with a large validation cohort including unsupervised home sampling. This protocol might be of big importance for surveillance in resource-limited settings, providing low-cost highly accurate serology data.
