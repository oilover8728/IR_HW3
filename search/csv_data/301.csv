3000,Characteristics of a COVID-19 confirmed case series in primary care (COVID-19-PC project): a cross-sectional study.,"Background: To estimate the prevalence of symptoms and signs related to a COVID-19 case series confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Risk factors and the associated use of health services will also be analysed. Methods: Observational, descriptive, retrospective case series study. The study was performed at two Primary Care Health Centres located in Madrid, Spain. The subjects studied were all PCR SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases older than 18 years, diagnosed from the beginning of the community transmission (March 13) until April 15, 2020. We collected sociodemographic, clinical, health service utilization and clinical course variables during the following months. All data was gathered by their own attending physician, and electronic medical records were reviewed individually. Statistical analysis: A descriptive analysis was carried out and a Poisson regression model was adjusted to study associated factors to Health Services use. Results: Out of the 499 patients studied from two health centres, 55.1% were women and mean age was 58.2 (17.3). 25.1% were healthcare professionals. The most frequent symptoms recorded related to COVID-19 were cough (77.9%; CI 95% 46.5-93.4), fever (77.7%; CI95% 46.5-93.4) and dyspnoea (54.1%, CI95% 46.6-61.4). 60.7% were admitted to hospital. 64.5% first established contact with their primary care provider before going to the hospital, with a mean number of 11.4 Healthcare Providers Encounters with primary care during all the follow-up period. The number of visit-encounters with primary care was associated with being male [IRR 1.072 (1.013, 1.134)], disease severity {from mild respiratory infection [IRR 1.404 (1.095, 1.801)], up to bilateral pneumonia [IRR 1.852 (1.437,2.386)]}, and the need of a work leave [IRR 1.326 (1.244, 1.413]. Conclusion: Symptoms and risk factors in our case series are similar to those in other studies. There was a high number of patients with atypical unilateral or bilateral pneumonia. Care for COVID has required a high use of healthcare resources such as clinical encounters and work leaves."
3001,Bioinformatics Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 to Approach an Effective Vaccine Candidate Against COVID-19.,"The emerging Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a serious threat to the public health worldwide, demanding urgent vaccine provide. According to the virus feature as an RNA virus, a high rate of mutations imposes some vaccine design difficulties. Bioinformatics tools have been widely used to make advantage of conserved regions as well as immunogenicity. In this study, we aimed at immunoinformatic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins conservancy and immunogenicity to design a preventive vaccine candidate. Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid amino acid sequences were obtained, and four possible fusion proteins were assessed and compared in terms of structural features and immunogenicity, and population coverage. MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, the linear and conformational B-cell epitopes were evaluated. Among the predicted models, the truncated form of Spike in fusion with M and N protein applying AAY linker has high rate of MHC-I and MCH-II epitopes with high antigenicity and acceptable population coverage of 82.95% in Iran and 92.51% in Europe. The in silico study provided truncated Spike-M-N SARS-CoV-2 as a potential preventive vaccine candidate for further in vivo evaluation."

3004,"Eosinophils and COVID-19: diagnosis, prognosis, and vaccination strategies.","The unprecedented impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in global challenges to our health-care systems and our economic security. As such, there has been significant research into all aspects of the disease, including diagnostic biomarkers, associated risk factors, and strategies that might be used for its treatment and prevention. Toward this end, eosinopenia has been identified as one of many factors that might facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of severe COVID-19. However, this finding is neither definitive nor pathognomonic for COVID-19. While eosinophil-associated conditions have been misdiagnosed as COVID-19 and others are among its reported complications, patients with pre-existing eosinophil-associated disorders (e.g., asthma, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders) do not appear to be at increased risk for severe disease; interestingly, several recent studies suggest that a diagnosis of asthma may be associated with some degree of protection. Finally, although vaccine-associated aberrant inflammatory responses, including eosinophil accumulation in the respiratory tract, were observed in preclinical immunization studies targeting the related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogens, no similar complications have been reported clinically in response to the widespread dissemination of either of the two encapsulated mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19."
3005,Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among the Pakistani population.,"This study examined the factors associated with acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine compared to hesitance in the Pakistani population and specifically focusing on the perceived beliefs, knowledge, concerns, risk, and safety perception relating to the COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 423 subjects were recruited from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan. A 27-item valid and reliable questionnaire was used to assess socio-demographic characteristics, acceptance, and hesitance toward COVID-19 vaccine, perceived beliefs, knowledge, perceived concerns, risk, and safety of COVID-19 vaccines and its source of information. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used for analysis. About 53% of the participants were planning to get vaccinated and a significantly greater proportion of better educated, higher income, and healthier participants in the vaccine acceptance group (p < .05). The odds of knowing the vaccine they should get, having the confidence in the vaccine to stop the pandemic, and understanding the way vaccines work, were greater in the vaccine acceptance group than the vaccine-hesitant group (OR: 5.4; 3.5, 2.1, 3.1, respectively). Most participants (52.3%) obtained the information regarding the COVID-19 vaccine from the print and live news media (52.3%) followed by social media (23.7%). The lack of knowledge, understanding, and perception of the risk, safety partly explains the low rate of vaccine acceptance in the Pakistani population. Strategies to raise awareness of the benefits of vaccination should target individuals in the lower socioeconomic group and those with chronic disease."
3006,Saliva Testing Is Accurate for Early-Stage and Presymptomatic COVID-19.,"Although nasopharyngeal samples have been considered the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, variability in viral load across different anatomical sites could cause nasopharyngeal samples to be less sensitive than saliva or nasal samples in certain cases. Self-collected samples have logistical advantages over nasopharyngeal samples, making them amenable to population-scale screening. To evaluate sampling alternatives for population screening, we collected nasopharyngeal, saliva, and nasal samples from two cohorts with varied levels and types of symptoms. In a mixed cohort of 60 symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, we found that saliva had 88% concordance with nasopharyngeal samples when tested in the same testing lab (n = 41) and 68% concordance when tested in different testing labs (n = 19). In a second cohort of 20 participants hospitalized for COVID-19, saliva had 74% concordance with nasopharyngeal samples tested in the same testing lab but detected virus in two participants that tested negative with nasopharyngeal samples on the same day. Medical record review showed that the saliva-based testing sensitivity was related to the timing of symptom onset and disease stage. We find that no sample site will be perfectly sensitive for COVID-19 testing in all situations, and the significance of negative results will always need to be determined in the context of clinical signs and symptoms. Saliva retained high clinical sensitivity for early-stage and presymptomatic COVID-19 while allowing easier collection, minimizing the exposure of health care workers, and need for personal protective equipment and making it a viable option for population-scale testing. IMPORTANCE Methods for COVID-19 detection are necessary for public health efforts to monitor the spread of disease. Nasopharyngeal samples have been considered the best approach for COVID-19 testing. However, alternative samples like self-collected saliva offer advantages for population-scale screening. Meta-analyses of recent studies suggest that saliva is useful for detecting SARS-CoV-2; however, differences in disease prevalence, sample collection, and analysis methods still confound strong conclusions on the utility of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal samples. Here, we find that the sensitivity of saliva testing is related to both the timing of the sample collection relative to symptom onset and the disease stage. Importantly, several clinical vignettes in our cohorts highlight the challenges of medical decision making with limited knowledge of the associations between laboratory test data and the natural biology of infection."
3007,Site-Specific Steric Control of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycosylation.,"A central tenet in the design of vaccines is the display of native-like antigens in the elicitation of protective immunity. The abundance of N-linked glycans across the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a potential source of heterogeneity among the many different vaccine candidates under investigation. Here, we investigate the glycosylation of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins from five different laboratories and compare them against S protein from infectious virus, cultured in Vero cells. We find patterns that are conserved across all samples, and this can be associated with site-specific stalling of glycan maturation that acts as a highly sensitive reporter of protein structure. Molecular dynamics simulations of a fully glycosylated spike support a model of steric restrictions that shape enzymatic processing of the glycans. These results suggest that recombinant spike-based SARS-CoV-2 immunogen glycosylation reproducibly recapitulates signatures of viral glycosylation."
3008,Identification of Patient Characteristics Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Outcome in Kidney Transplant Patients Using Serological Screening.,"Background: From population studies, solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of mortality from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection. The risk factors associated with infection acquisition and mortality in transplant recipients using serological data have not been reported. Methods: From 1725 maintenance transplant recipients, 855 consecutive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Serological screening utilized assays to detect both the N protein and receptor binding domain antibodies. Thirty-three of 855 (3.9%) of the screened patients had prior infection confirmed with RT-PCR. Twenty-one additional patients from our 1725 maintenance cohort with RT-PCR confirmed infection were included in our analysis. Results: Eighty-nine of 855 (10.4%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Fifty-nine of 89 (66.3%) cases were patients newly identified as exposed, while 30/89 (33.7%) seropositive patients had previous infection confirmed by RT-PCR. A diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR or Ab+) was associated with being from a noncaucasoid background, P = 0.015; having a diagnosis of diabetes, P = 0.028 and a history of allograft rejection, P < 0.01. Compared with the RT-PCR+ cohort, patients with serological-proven infection alone were more likely to be receiving tacrolimus monotherapy, P < 0.01, and less likely to have a diagnosis of diabetes, P = 0.012. Seventeen of 113 (15.0%) of all patients with infection (RT-PCR and Ab+) died. Risk factors associated with survival were older age, odds ratio (OR): 1.07 (1.00-1.13), P = 0.041; receiving prednisolone, OR: 5.98 (1.65-21.60), P < 0.01 and the absence of diabetes, OR: 0.27 (0.07-0.99), P = 0.047. Conclusions: This study identifies risk factors and outcome for COVID-19 infection incorporating data on serologically defined infection and highlights the important contribution of immunosuppression regimen on outcomes."
3009,Revelation of Potent Epitopes Present in Unannotated ORF Antigens of SARS-CoV-2 for Epitope-Based Polyvalent Vaccine Design Using Immunoinformatics Approach.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) kills thousands of people worldwide every day, thus necessitating rapid development of countermeasures. Immunoinformatics analyses carried out here in search of immunodominant regions in recently identified SARS-CoV-2 unannotated open reading frames (uORFs) have identified eight linear B-cell, one conformational B-cell, 10 CD4+ T-cell, and 12 CD8+ T-cell promising epitopes. Among them, ORF9b B-cell and T-cell epitopes are the most promising followed by M.ext and ORF3c epitopes. ORF9b40-48 (CD8+ T-cell epitope) is found to be highly immunogenic and antigenic with the highest allele coverage. Furthermore, it has overlap with four potent CD4+ T-cell epitopes. Structure-based B-cell epitope prediction has identified ORF9b61-68 to be immunodominant, which partially overlaps with one of the linear B-cell epitopes (ORF9b65-69). ORF3c CD4+ T-cell epitopes (ORF3c2-16, ORF3c3-17, and ORF3c4-18) and linear B-cell epitope (ORF3c14-22) have also been identified as the candidate epitopes. Similarly, M.ext and 7a.iORF1 (overlap with M and ORF7a) proteins have promising immunogenic regions. By considering the level of antigen expression, four ORF9b and five M.ext epitopes are finally shortlisted as potent epitopes. Mutation analysis has further revealed that the shortlisted potent uORF epitopes are resistant to recurrent mutations. Additionally, four N-protein (expressed by canonical ORF) epitopes are found to be potent. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 uORF B-cell and T-cell epitopes identified here along with canonical ORF epitopes may aid in the design of a promising epitope-based polyvalent vaccine (when connected through appropriate linkers) against SARS-CoV-2. Such a vaccine can act as a bulwark against SARS-CoV-2, especially in the scenario of emergence of variants with recurring mutations in the spike protein."
