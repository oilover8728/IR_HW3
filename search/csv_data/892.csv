8910,[COVID-19 preparedness in ophthalmology].,"Background: Healthcare work is a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objectives: To review risk mitigation strategies in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: Risk mitigation strategies to maintain ophthalmology care, to prevent collateral damage from care disruption, and to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are summarized based on the example of a tertiary referral center in Germany. Results: Clinical management strategies included restricted access to buildings, triage systems, telemedicine approaches, strategies for rapid treat and release, and transparent communication strategies. Strategies to protect patients and staff relied on both standard hygiene precautions and the use of personal protective equipment for prevention of droplet infections. Physical barriers supported risk mitigation strategies. Conclusion: To maintain ophthalmological care during the COVID-19 pandemic, a coordinated, multifaceted approach using risk mitigation strategies to protect staff, patients, and the public was initiated."
8911,A hybrid fractional optimal control for a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) mathematical model.,"Introduction: Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since world war two. To describe this disease mathematically, we noted that COVID-19, due to uncertainties associated to the pandemic, ordinal derivatives and their associated integral operators show deficient. The fractional order differential equations models seem more consistent with this disease than the integer order models. This is due to the fact that fractional derivatives and integrals enable the description of the memory and hereditary properties inherent in various materials and processes. Hence there is a growing need to study and use the fractional order differential equations. Also, optimal control theory is very important topic to control the variables in mathematical models of infectious disease. Moreover, a hybrid fractional operator which may be expressed as a linear combination of the Caputo fractional derivative and the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral is recently introduced. This new operator is more general than the operator of Caputo's fractional derivative. Numerical techniques are very important tool in this area of research because most fractional order problems do not have exact analytic solutions. Objectives: A novel fractional order Coronavirus (2019-nCov) mathematical model with modified parameters will be presented. Optimal control of the suggested model is the main objective of this work. Three control variables are presented in this model to minimize the number of infected populations. Necessary control conditions will be derived. Methods: The numerical methods used to study the fractional optimality system are the weighted average nonstandard finite difference method and the Grünwald-Letnikov nonstandard finite difference method. Results: The proposed model with a new fractional operator is presented. We have successfully applied a kind of Pontryagin's maximum principle and were able to reduce the number of infected people using the proposed numerical methods. The weighted average nonstandard finite difference method with the new operator derivative has the best results than Grünwald-Letnikov nonstandard finite difference method with the same operator. Moreover, the proposed methods with the new operator have the best results than the proposed methods with Caputo operator. Conclusions: The combination of fractional order derivative and optimal control in the Coronavirus (2019-nCov) mathematical model improves the dynamics of the model. The new operator is more general and suitable to study the optimal control of the proposed model than the Caputo operator and could be more useful for the researchers and scientists."

8913,Immunotherapeutic approaches to curtail COVID-19.,"COVID-19, the disease induced by the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has imposed an unpredictable burden on the world. Drug repurposing has been employed to rapidly find a cure; but despite great efforts, no drug or vaccine is presently available for treating or prevention of COVID-19. Apart from antivirals, immunotherapeutic strategies are suggested considering the role of the immune response as the host defense against the virus, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 suppresses interferon induction as an immune evasion strategy. Active immunization through vaccines, interferon administration, passive immunotherapy by convalescent plasma or synthesized monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, are different immunotherapeutic approaches that will be mentioned in this review. The focus would be on passive immunotherapeutic interventions. Interferons might be helpful in some stages. Vaccine development has been followed with unprecedented speed. Some of these vaccines have been advanced to human clinical trials. Convalescent plasma therapy is already practiced in many countries to help save the lives of severely ill patients. Different antibodies that target various steps of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or the associated immune responses are also proposed. For treating the cytokine storm induced at a late stage of the disease in some patients, immune modulation through JAK inhibitors, corticosteroids, and some other cognate classes are evaluated. Given the changing pattern of cytokine induction and immune responses throughout the COVID-19 disease course, different adapted approaches are needed to help patients. Gaining more knowledge about the detailed pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, its interplay with the immune system, and viral-mediated responses are crucial to identify efficient preventive and therapeutic approaches. A systemic approach seems essential in this regard."
8914,"Association between ABO blood types and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), genetic associations, and underlying molecular mechanisms: a literature review of 23 studies.","An association of various blood types and the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been found in a number of publications. The aim of this literature review is to summarize key findings related to ABO blood types and COVID-19 infection rate, symptom presentation, and outcome. Summarized findings include associations between ABO blood type and higher infection susceptibility, intubation duration, and severe outcomes, including death. The literature suggests that blood type O may serve as a protective factor, as individuals with blood type O are found COVID-19 positive at far lower rates. This could suggest that blood type O individuals are less susceptible to infection, or that they are asymptomatic at higher rates and therefore do not seek out testing. We also discuss genetic associations and potential molecular mechanisms that drive the relationship between blood type and COVID-19. Studies have found a strong association between a locus on a specific gene cluster on chromosome three (chr3p21.31) and outcome severity, such as respiratory failure. Cellular models have suggested an explanation for blood type modulation of infection, evidencing that spike protein/Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-dependent adhesion to ACE2-expressing cell lines was specifically inhibited by monoclonal or natural human anti-A antibodies, so individuals with non-A blood types, specifically O, or B blood types, which produce anti-A antibodies, may be less susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection due to the inhibitory effects of anti-A antibodies."
8915,Coronavirus disease-2019 and the intestinal tract: An overview.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can progress to a severe respiratory and systemic disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The most common symptoms are fever and respiratory discomfort. Nevertheless, gastrointestinal infections have been reported, with symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and lack of appetite. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 can remain positive in fecal samples after nasopharyngeal clearance. After gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viral gastrointestinal infections, some patients may develop alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota. In addition, some COVID-19 patients may receive antibiotics, which may also disturb gastrointestinal homeostasis. In summary, the gastrointestinal system, gut microbiome, and gut-lung axis may represent an important role in the development, severity, and treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, in this review, we explore the current pieces of evidence of COVID-19 gastrointestinal manifestations, possible implications, and interventions."
8916,Favipiravir use for SARS CoV-2 infection.,"Introduction: The pandemic of SARS CoV-2 has required urgent medical treatments for numerous patients. As no specific antiviral agents were available, different off-the-shelf alternatives have been explored. Objective: Here, we review the rationale behind the use of Favipiravir, and report of the specific studies supporting this treatment being conducted. Methods: Here we analyze the relevant literature to conclude about the present opportunities offered by this therapeutic agent. Results: This antiviral drug approved influenza in Japan since 2014, has a demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS CoV-2 and is being investigated in several trials for SARS CoV-2. Signals of benefit were shown in a small trial for SARS CoV-2. However, in another small study, there was no advantage. Conclusions: Further studies, statistically more significant, are urgently needed to understand the best opportunities offered by this treatment."

8918,SARS-CoV-2-Induced Kawasaki-Like Hyperinflammatory Syndrome: A Novel COVID Phenotype in Children.,"We describe 2 children with persistent fever and profuse diarrhea who developed signs of mucocutaneous involvement (conjunctivitis, fissured lips, skin rash, erythema, and edema of the hands and feet). Blood tests revealed elevated markers of inflammation, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and complement consumption. Afterward, diffuse edema with hypoalbuminemia appeared in the context of a capillary leak syndrome. In both patients, repeated nasal swabs were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but each patient had high titers of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The negative PCR results in the presence of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G suggested that the inflammatory response developed in the late phase of viral infection, when SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in the upper airway. In this report, we describe patients with what we propose to name as SARS-CoV-2-induced Kawasaki-like hyperinflammatory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2-induced Kawasaki-like hyperinflammatory syndrome seems to be caused by a delayed response to SARS-CoV-2. It resembles Kawasaki disease complicated by macrophage activation syndrome, although it has peculiar features, such as prodromal diarrhea, capillary leak syndrome, and myocardial dysfunction. Intravenous corticosteroid treatment appears to be helpful."
8919,An Acute Manic Episode During 2019-nCoV Quarantine.,"Background: The 2019-nCov pandemic is currently a stressor for the general public worldwide. In China, people who have a history of contact with infected or suspected individuals need to quarantine for at least 2 weeks. Many people experienced anxiety, panic and depression in the quarantine period. However, acute manic episode triggered by stressful events is not common and was neglected. Case presentation: A 32-year-old woman with direct contact history with her infected colleagues showed elevated mood and increased activity when she was identified negative of nuclear acid amplification test, after experiencing extreme stress in quarantine. She was diagnosed with acute manic episode finally. The social zeitgeber and reward hypersensitivity theoretical models have attempted to use psychobiological perspectives to determine why life stress can trigger a mood episode, including (hypo)mania. Besides, the temporal correlation between her somatic symptoms and psychological stimuli indicated a possibility of functional disturbance under acute stress. Conclusion: Quarantine is a major stressful event disrupting social zeitgebers for people who have had contact with infected individuals, especially for vulnerable individuals with a hypersensitive reward system. Stress could act as a trigger in the onset of manic episode, so psychological support should be more targeted at the vulnerable individuals in the initial phase of emergent crisis."
