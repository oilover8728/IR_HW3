3520,Electrochemical immunosensor with Cu(2)O nanocube coating for detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic starting in 2020. Accordingly, testing is crucial for mitigating the economic and public health effects. In order to facilitate point-of-care diagnosis, this study aims at presenting a label-free electrochemical biosensor as a powerful nanobiodevice for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection. Utilizing the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody onto the electrode surface as a specific platform in an ordered orientation through staphylococcal protein A (ProtA) is highly significant in fabricating the designed nanobiodevice. In this sense, the screen-printed carbon electrode modified with Cu2O nanocubes (Cu2O NCs), which provide a large surface area in a very small space, was applied in order to increase the ProtA loading on the electrode surface. Accordingly, the sensitivity and stability of the sensing platform significantly increased. The electrochemical evaluations proved that there is a very good linear relationship between the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and spike protein contents via a specific binding reaction in the range 0.25 fg mL-1 to 1 μg mL-1. Moreover, the assay when tested with influenza viruses 1 and 2 was performed in 20 min with a low detection limit of 0.04 fg mL-1 for spike protein without any cross-reactivity. The designed nanobiodevice exhibited an average satisfactory recovery rate of ~ 97-103% in different artificial sample matrices, i.e., saliva, artificial nasal, and universal transport medium (UTM), illustrating its high detection performance and practicability. The nanobiodevice was also tested using real patients and healthy samples, where the results had been already obtained using the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, and showed satisfactory results.

3521,Intention to Take COVID-19 Vaccine as a Precondition for International Travel: Application of Extended Norm-Activation Model.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to human health, the global economy, and the social fabrics of contemporary societies as many aspects of modern everyday life, including travel and leisure, have been shattered to pieces. Hence, a COVID-19 mandatory vaccination as a precondition for international travel is being debated in many countries. Thus, the present research aimed to study the intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine as a precondition for international travel using an extended Norm-Activation Model. The study model integrates a new construct, namely mass media coverage on COVID-19 vaccination as additional predictor of intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The survey data were collected from 1221 international travelers. Structural equation modelling shows a very good fit of the final model to the data; the conceptual model based on extended Norm-Activation Model was strongly supported. Awareness of consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' health has shown a positive effect on individuals' ascribed responsibility to adopt emotionally driven (anticipated pride and anticipated guilt) pro-social behaviors that activate a personal norm towards altruistic and pro-mandatory vaccination-friendly behavior. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

3523,Toward better preparedness for the next pandemic.,"New York City has been described as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. While health care workers are notably at increased risk for COVID-19 infection, the impact on resident physicians remains unclear. In this issue of the JCI, Breazzano et al. surveyed resident physicians for their exposure to COVID-19 during the exponential phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers also assessed how personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing protected health care workers from infection. This study highlights resident physician experiences of the first COVID-19 wave that can inform and improve preparedness for upcoming COVID-19 surges and other future epidemics."
3524,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA residue on object surfaces in nucleic acid testing laboratory using droplet digital PCR.,"The rapid development of global COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to the safety and quality of laboratory diagnostic testing. Little is known about the laboratory surface areas and operation behaviors that may cause potential contamination in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. This study aims to provide reference basis for the improvement of laboratory disinfection programs and personal operating protocols. In this study, we compared the qRT-PCR and ddPCR in detecting of residual virus that existed on the object surfaces from sample transportation and reception related facilities, testing related instruments, personal protective equipment and other facilities in nucleic acid testing laboratory. All samples were negative by qRT-PCR, in contrast, 13 of 61 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by ddPCR. The areas with highest density of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were the outer gloves of operator A (37.4 copies/cm2), followed by door handle of 4 °C refrigerator (26.25 copies/cm2), goggles of operator A (22.16 copies/cm2), outer cover of high speed centrifuge (19.95 copies/cm2), inner wall of high speed centrifuge (14.70 copies/cm2) and others. We found that all the positive objects were directly or indirectly contacted by the operator's gloved hands, suggesting that hands contact was the main transmission pathway that led to laboratory environmental contamination. In summary, ddPCR has an advantage over qRT-PCR in tracing laboratory contamination. We evaluated the risk areas and operation behaviors that may easily cause contamination, and provided recommendation for improving the laboratory disinfection programs and personal operating specifications."

3527,Development of safe and highly protective live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates by genome recoding.,"Safe and effective vaccines are urgently needed to stop the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We construct a series of live attenuated vaccine candidates by large-scale recoding of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and assess their safety and efficacy in Syrian hamsters. Animals were vaccinated with a single dose of the respective recoded virus and challenged 21 days later. Two of the tested viruses do not cause clinical symptoms but are highly immunogenic and induce strong protective immunity. Attenuated viruses replicate efficiently in the upper but not in the lower airways, causing only mild pulmonary histopathology. After challenge, hamsters develop no signs of disease and rapidly clear challenge virus: at no time could infectious virus be recovered from the lungs of infected animals. The ease with which attenuated virus candidates can be produced and administered favors their further development as vaccines to combat the ongoing pandemic."

3529,A global survey of potential acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine.,"Several coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are currently in human trials. In June 2020, we surveyed 13,426 people in 19 countries to determine potential acceptance rates and factors influencing acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. Of these, 71.5% of participants reported that they would be very or somewhat likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine, and 48.1% reported that they would accept their employer's recommendation to do so. Differences in acceptance rates ranged from almost 90% (in China) to less than 55% (in Russia). Respondents reporting higher levels of trust in information from government sources were more likely to accept a vaccine and take their employer's advice to do so."
