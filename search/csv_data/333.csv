3325,[Assessment of subjective risk of infection and willingness to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 among German ophthalmologists : Results of a survey by DOG and BVA].,"Background and objective: After approval of the first COVID-19 vaccines in Germany, vaccination prioritization and vaccination preparedness are central topics in the discussion on strategies to end the pandemic. How ophthalmologists evaluate their risk of infection and whether they are willing to be vaccinated has not been investigated so far. The aim of this project was to assess the subjective rating of the risk of infection and the willingness to be vaccinated among German ophthalmologists. Methods: Data were collected by an anonymous online survey conducted by the Professional Association of Ophthalmologists in Germany (BVA) and the German Ophthalmological Society (DOG) under the auspices of the University Eye Hospital Düsseldorf. The questionnaire was open for participation from 22 January to 12 February 2021. The survey was addressed to all colleagues in ophthalmology. Results: A total of 1162 completed questionnaires were analyzed. On average, survey respondents rated their risk of infection as 7.5 ± 1.9 (scale of 1-10; 1 = very low risk, 10 = very high risk). Of the respondents 971 (83.6%) rated their risk of infection as higher compared to other disciplines and 92.9% (n = 1079) indicated they would be willing to be vaccinated. Conclusion: The ophthalmologists interviewed consider their professional group to be exposed to an above-average risk of SARS-COV‑2 infection compared to other disciplines. They frequently criticized the prioritization ranking of the German Ministry of Health (BMG), which deviated from the suggestions of the Standing Vaccination Committee of Germany (STIKO). The willingness to be vaccinated was very high among the surveyed German ophthalmologists."
3326,Qualitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody avidity by lateral flow immunochromatographic IgG/IgM antibody assay.,"Knowledge of the precise timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be of clinical and epidemiological relevance. The presence of low-avidity IgGs has conventionally been considered an indicator of recent infection. Here, we carried out qualitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody avidity using an urea (6M) dissociation test performed on a lateral flow immunochromatographic IgG/IgM device. We included a total of 76 serum specimens collected from 57 COVID-19 patients, of which 39 tested positive for both IgG and IgM and 37 only for IgG. Sera losing IgG reactivity after urea treatment (n = 28) were drawn significantly earlier (P = .04) after onset of symptoms than those which preserved it (n = 48). This assay may be helpful to estimate the time of acquisition of infection in patients with mild to severe COVID-19."

3329,Transplantation in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic: How should transplant patients and programs be handled?,"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, transplant programs worldwide have been severely impacted with dwindling numbers of transplantations performed and a complete halt in several areas. In this review we examine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection presents differently in transplant recipients, whom and how we should test, how susceptible the transplant population is to overt infection and describe the range of outcomes. From retrieved published reports on SARS-CoV-2infections in 389solid organ transplant recipients reported in the literature, the overall mortality rate was 16.7% (n = 65); however for those with mild or moderate Covid-19 disease this was 2.9% and 2.3% respectively; conversely, for those with severe infection the mortality rate was 52.2%.We then address questions regarding halting transplantation programs during this pandemic, whether all human tissues being considered for transplantation are capable of transmitting the infection, and if we should alter immunosuppressive medications during the pandemic."
