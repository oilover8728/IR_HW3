1731,Editorial: COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).,"In early 2020, at the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rare cases were reported in children and adolescents of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan dysfunction and usually presents late in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since May 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded all reported cases of COVID-19 and MIS-C in children and adolescents in the USA. In April 2021, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) revised its clinical guidelines for diagnosing and managing hyperinflammation and MIS-C. There are several challenges ahead for preventing, diagnosing, and managing MIS-C, particularly following the rapid emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2. This Editorial aims to present an update on the current status of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of MIS-C and includes some updates from population studies and clinical guidelines."

1733,Development and evaluation of a Novel RT-PCR system for reliable and rapid SARS-CoV-2 screening of blood donations.,"Background: The ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused great global concerns. In contrast to SARS, some SARS-CoV-2-infected people can be asymptomatic or have only mild nonspecific symptoms. Furthermore, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may be infectious during an asymptomatic incubation period. With the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in plasma or serum, blood safety is worthy of consideration. Study design and methods: We developed a nucleic acid test (NAT) screening system for SARS-CoV-2 targeting nucleocapsid protein (N) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF 1ab) gene that could screen 5076 samples every 24 hours. The 2019 novel coronavirus RNA standard was used to evaluate linearity of standard curves. Diagnostic sensitivity and reproducibility were evaluated using artificial SARS-CoV-2. Specificity was evaluated with 61 other respiratory pathogens. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by testing two sputum and nine oropharyngeal swab specimens. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood donor specimens collected during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Chengdu. Results: Limits of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for N and ORF 1ab gene were 12.5 and 27.58 copies/mL, respectively. Intra-assay and interassay for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay based on cycle threshold were acceptably low. No cross-reactivity was observed with other respiratory virus and bacterial isolates. The overall agreement value between the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay and clinical diagnostic results was 100%. A total of 16 287 blood specimens collected from blood donors during SARS-CoV-2 surveillance were tested negative. Conclusions: A high-throughput NAT screening system was developed for SARS-CoV-2 screening of blood donations during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2."

1736,After the pandemic: perspectives on the future trajectory of COVID-19.,"There is a realistic expectation that the global effort in vaccination will bring the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) under control. Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about the type of long-term association that the virus will establish with the human population and, in particular, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will become an endemic disease. Although the trajectory is difficult to predict, the conditions, concepts and variables that influence this transition can be anticipated. Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 as an endemic virus, perhaps with seasonal epidemic peaks, may be fuelled by pockets of susceptible individuals and waning immunity after infection or vaccination, changes in the virus through antigenic drift that diminish protection and re-entries from zoonotic reservoirs. Here we review relevant observations from previous epidemics and discuss the potential evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as it adapts during persistent transmission in the presence of a level of population immunity. Lack of effective surveillance or adequate response could enable the emergence of new epidemic or pandemic patterns from an endemic infection of SARS-CoV-2. There are key pieces of data that are urgently needed in order to make good decisions; we outline these and propose a way forward."
1737,"Vaccine-escape and fast-growing mutations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, Spain, India, and other COVID-19-devastated countries.","Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 variants from the United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, and Brazil have received much attention for their increased infectivity, potentially high virulence, and possible threats to existing vaccines and antibody therapies. The question remains if there are other more infectious variants transmitted around the world. We carry out a large-scale study of 506,768 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates from patients to identify many other rapidly growing mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We reveal that essentially all 100 most observed mutations strengthen the binding between the RBD and the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicating the virus evolves toward more infectious variants. In particular, we discover new fast-growing RBD mutations N439K, S477N, S477R, and N501T that also enhance the RBD and ACE2 binding. We further unveil that mutation N501Y involved in United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, and Brazil variants may moderately weaken the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies, while mutations E484K and K417N found in South Africa and Brazilian variants, L452R and E484Q found in India variants, can potentially disrupt the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies. Among these RBD mutations, L452R is also now known as part of the California variant B.1.427. Finally, we hypothesize that RBD mutations that can simultaneously make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious and disrupt the existing antibodies, called vaccine escape mutations, will pose an imminent threat to the current crop of vaccines. A list of most likely vaccine escape mutations is given, including S494P, Q493L, K417N, F490S, F486L, R403K, E484K, L452R, K417T, F490L, E484Q, and A475S. Mutation T478K appears to make the Mexico variant B.1.1.222 the most infectious one. Our comprehensive genetic analysis and protein-protein binding study show that the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 on the RBD, which may be regulated by host gene editing, viral proofreading, random genetic drift, and natural selection, gives rise to more infectious variants that will potentially compromise existing vaccines and antibody therapies."
1738,Cochrane corner: universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Introduction: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild disease with non-specific symptoms, although a few becoming critically ill with septic shock and multiple organ failure. There is an unknown proportion of infected individuals who remain asymptomatic and infectious. Universal screening for COVID-19 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. We highlight a Cochrane rapid review which assessed the effectiveness and accuracy of universal screening for COVID-19 infection. Methods: the authors of the Cochrane review searched multiple electronic databases to identify studies reporting on the effectiveness of universal screening and reporting on screening test accuracy. Eligible participants for the review included people who had not sought care for potential COVID-19 symptoms. Results: the authors included 22 publications, with none of them conducted in Africa. Two modelling studies reported on the beneficial and negative effects of screening; and 20 studies (cohort and modelling) reported data on the accuracy of screening tests. The included studies had wide variability in the baseline prevalence of COVID-19 infection as well as study settings and methods. All cohort studies compared screening strategies to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the gold standard. The rapid review suggests that there is low certainty of evidence that screening at travel hubs may slow the importation of infected cases. Furthermore, the review highlights the uncertainty and variation in the accuracy of screening. Conclusion: given the low accuracy of the tests included in this review, a high proportion of COVID-19 infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others. In addition, some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals."
