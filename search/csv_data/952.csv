9511,Stability issues of RT-PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19.,"In this study, we collected a total of 610 hospitalized patients from Wuhan between February 2, 2020, and February 17, 2020. We reported a potentially high false negative rate of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the 610 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 2019 outbreak. We also found that the RT-PCR results from several tests at different points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Our results indicate that in addition to the emphasis on RT-PCR testing, clinical indicators such as computed tomography images should also be used not only for diagnosis and treatment but also for isolation, recovery/discharge, and transferring for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the current epidemic. These results suggested the urgent needs for the standard of procedures of sampling from different anatomic sites, sample transportation, optimization of RT-PCR, serology diagnosis/screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and distinct diagnosis from other respiratory diseases such as fluenza infections as well."
9512,"Proteo-Genomic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2: A Clinical Landscape of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms, COVID-19 Proteome, and Host Responses.","A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and continues to be a global health challenge. To understand viral disease biology, we have carried out proteo-genomic analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry on nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients to examine the clinical genome and proteome. Our study confirms the mutability of SARS-CoV-2 showing multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms. NGS analysis detected 27 mutations, of which 14 are synonymous, 11 are missense, and 2 are extragenic in nature. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates indicated their close relation to a Bangladesh isolate and multiple origins of isolates within the country. Our proteomic analysis, for the first time, identified 13 different SARS-CoV-2 proteins from the clinical swabs. Of the total 41 peptides captured by high-resolution mass spectrometry, 8 matched to nucleocapsid protein, 2 to ORF9b, and 1 to spike glycoprotein and ORF3a, with remaining peptides mapping to ORF1ab polyprotein. Additionally, host proteome analysis revealed several key host proteins to be uniquely expressed in COVID-19 patients. Pathway analysis of these proteins points toward modulation in immune response, especially involving neutrophil and IL-12-mediated signaling. Besides revealing the aspects of host-virus pathogenesis, our study opens new avenues to develop better diagnostic markers and therapeutic approaches."
9513,All together to Fight COVID-19.,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), named a pandemic by the WHO, is the current global health crisis. National and international collaboration are indispensable for combating COVID-19 and other similar potential outbreaks. International efforts to tackle this complex problem have led to remarkable scientific advances. Yet, as a global society, we can and must take additional measures to fight this pandemic. Undoubtedly, our approach toward COVID-19 was not perfect, and testing has not been deployed fast enough to arrest the epidemic early on. It is critical that we revise our approaches to be more prepared for pandemics as a united body by promoting global cooperation and commitment."

9515,Discovery Proteomics for COVID-19: Where We Are Now.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible coronavirus responsible for the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has had a devastating impact on society. Here, we summarize proteomic research that has helped elucidate hallmark proteins associated with the disease with respect to both short- and long-term diagnosis and prognosis. Additionally, we review the highly variable humoral response associated with COVID-19 and the increased risk of autoimmunity."
9516,Clinical validation of a second generation anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM automated chemiluminescent immunoassay.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has proven to be extremely contagious and has spread rapidly all over the world. A key aspect in limiting the virus diffusion is to ensure early and accurate diagnosis. Serological assays could be an alternative in increasing testing capabilities, particularly when used as part of an algorithmic approach combined with molecular analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a second generation chemiluminescent automated immunoassay able to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Data are carried out on healthy subjects and other infectious diseases pre-pandemic sera, as controls, and on two different coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized patient groups (early and late infection time). Data obtained have been analyzed in terms of precision, linearity, sensitivity and specificity. Specificities are: 100% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 98% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, in all patient groups. Sensitivities are: 97%, 100%, and 98% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 87%, 83%, and 86% for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM in the early infection, in the late infection and in the total patient group, respectively. The Mindray anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assays demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity, indicating that IgG and IgM simultaneous detection is useful even in the early phases of infection."
9517,Locally harvested Covid-19 convalescent plasma could probably help combat the geographically determined SARS-CoV-2 viral variants.,"The only effective way to provide individuals with herd immunity against the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] is to administer an effective vaccine that will help check the current pandemic status. In India, the central drugs standard control organization (CDSCO) has granted the emergency-use authorization [EUA] to three vaccines namely, Covishield (live vaccine, Oxford AstraZeneca, United Kingdom being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India), Covaxin (inactivated vaccine, Bharat Biotech, India) and Sputnik V (live vaccine, Gamaleya, Russia). However, there is a rising need for the efficacy of the vaccines to be proven against the ""SARS-CoV-2 viral variants."" Also, human plasma is polyclonal in nature with an inherent propensity to identify multiple epitopes of either an antigen or pathogen. With this context in mind, the researchers hypothesize that using COVID-19 convalescent plasma [CCP] harvested from the locally recovered individuals [i.e. potential CCP donors] may be particularly beneficial in combating not only the founder SARS-CoV-2 virus but also the geographically determined SARS-CoV-2 variants among the regionally affected COVID-19 patients."
9518,"COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine T cell epitope prediction analysis based on distributions of HLA class I loci (HLA-A, -B, -C) across global populations.","T cell immunity, such as CD4 and/or CD8 T cell responses, plays a vital role in controlling the virus infection and pathological damage. Several studies have reported SARS-CoV-2 proteins could serve as ideal vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection by activating the T cell responses. In the current study, based on the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and distribution of host human leukocyte antigen (HLA), we predicted the possible epitopes for the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections. Firstly, the current study retrieved the SARS-CoV-2 S and N protein sequences from the NCBI Database. Then, using the Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource, we predicted the CTL epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins according to worldwide frequency distributions of HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles (>1%). Our results predicted 90 and 106 epitopes of N and S proteins, respectively. Epitope cluster analysis showed 16 and 34 respective clusters of SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins, which covered 95.91% and 96.14% of the global population, respectively. After epitope conservancy analysis, 8 N protein epitopes and 6 S protein epitopes showed conservancy within two SARS-CoV-2 types. Of these 14 epitopes, 13 could cover SARS coronavirus and Bat SARS-like coronavirus. The remaining epitope (KWPWYIWLGF1211-1220) could cover MERS coronavirus. Finally, the 14-epitope combination could vaccinate 89.60% of all individuals worldwide. Our results propose single or combined CTL epitopes predicted in the current study as candidates for vaccines to effectively control SARS-CoV-2 infection and development."
