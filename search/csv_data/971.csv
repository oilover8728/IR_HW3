9700,Review of Associations between Built Environment Characteristics and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection Risk.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has stimulated intensive research interest in its transmission pathways and infection factors, e.g., socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, climatology, baseline health conditions or pre-existing diseases, and government policies. Meanwhile, some empirical studies suggested that built environment attributes may be associated with the transmission mechanism and infection risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, no review has been conducted to explore the effect of built environment characteristics on the infection risk. This research gap prevents government officials and urban planners from creating effective urban design guidelines to contain SARS-CoV-2 infections and face future pandemic challenges. This review summarizes evidence from 25 empirical studies and provides an overview of the effect of built environment on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. Virus infection risk was positively associated with the density of commercial facilities, roads, and schools and with public transit accessibility, whereas it was negatively associated with the availability of green spaces. This review recommends several directions for future studies, namely using longitudinal research design and individual-level data, considering multilevel factors and extending to diversified geographic areas."

9702,The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: What we know.,"There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak from spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus."
9703,Oral lesions associated with COVID-19: A systematic review.,"Background: Oral lesions has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there are gaps about the occurrence. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of oral lesions in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in four electronic databases (PubMed, Lilacs, Cochrane and Google Scholar) with the search terms: ""coronavírus"", ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""novel coronavírus"", ""2019nCoV"", ""oral manifestation"", ""mucosal lesions"", ""oral lesions"", ""mucosa viral lesions"" and ""oral conditions"". Articles were limited to those published between january and july 2020, and in English. Results: Initially, 182 articles were found, after reading the titles and abstracts a total of 24 records were included for full-text reading. Finally, 22 articles were included for data extraction and assessement. We identified and subsequently discussed clinical characteristics and differential diagnosis. Conclusions: The etiology of many oral mucosal lesions is intimately related to infectious, immunological, and psychosocial factors. Therefore, amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in which many doubts about the disease still remain, caution is needed when evaluating patients and establishing correlations with other diseases that could be associated."
9704,Performance Characteristics of Four High-Throughput Immunoassays for Detection of IgG Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.,"The role of serologic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in both the clinical and public health settings, will continue to evolve as we gain increasing insight into our immune response to the virus. Here, we evaluated four high-throughput serologic tests for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL), Epitope Diagnostics, Inc. (San Diego, CA), Euroimmun (Lubeck, Germany), and Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics (Rochester, NY), using a panel of serially collected serum samples (n = 224) from 56 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), healthy donor sera from 2018, and a cross-reactivity serum panel collected in early 2020. The sensitivities of the Abbott, Epitope, Euroimmun, and Ortho-Clinical IgG assays in convalescent-phase serum samples collected more than 14 days post-symptom onset or post-initial positive reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) result were 92.9% (78/84), 88.1% (74/84), 97.6% (82/84), and 98.8% (83/84), respectively. Among unique convalescent patients, sensitivities of the Abbott, Epitope, Euroimmun, and Ortho-Clinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays were 97.3% (36/37), 73% (27/37), 94.6% (35/37), and 97.3% (36/37), respectively. Overall assay specificity/positive predictive values based on a 5% prevalence rate were 99.6%/92.8%, 99.6%/90.6%, 98.0%/71.2%, and 99.6%/92.5%, respectively, for the Abbott, Epitope, Euroimmun, and Ortho-Clinical IgG assays. In conclusion, we show high sensitivity in convalescent-phase sera and high specificity for the Abbott, Euroimmun, and Ortho-Clinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays. With the unprecedented influx of commercially available serologic tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, it remains imperative that laboratories thoroughly evaluate such assays for accuracy prior to implementation."
9705,Ventilation in the Dental Clinic: An Effective Measure to Control Droplets and Aerosols during the Coronavirus Pandemic and Beyond.,"Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that human-to-human transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) most frequently occurs through virus-laden respiratory droplets discharged from infected individuals while coughing and sneezing. Aerosols can act as another potential transmission route. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised medical personnel to consider taking 'airborne precautions'. It is important to protect dentists and patients and reduce the amount of spatter produced during dental procedures. In order to prevent airborne transmission, dental offices should be sufficiently ventilated, with great emphasis placed upon removing bioaerosols."
9706,[NPPV Treatment for Neuromuscular Diseases during the COVID-19 Pandemic].,"A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from Wuhan in December 2019 and resulted in a severe outbreak of pneumonia (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets produced by coughs or sneezes, as well as aerosols containing viral particles. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is widely used to support respiration in patients with neuromuscular diseases. However, NPPV is also an aerosol-generating procedure. Without appropriate precautions, the risk of spreading the virus is high in NPPV users infected with SARS-CoV-2. At home, self-quarantine is effective in protecting caregivers of patients using NPPV, whereas in hospitals, using a negative pressure room is preferred. As SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces for several days, disinfecting the NPPV machine and the items frequently touched in the room is essential. Setting viral filters is useful for preventing virus transmission and keeping the inside of the NPPV machine clean. Caregivers must wear appropriate personal protective equipment. Furthermore, it should be paid attention to the potential transmission from asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers. During the current pandemic, it is necessary to minimize the risk of transmission among patients using NPPV."
9707,Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome and predictions of the human interactome.,"Specific elements of viral genomes regulate interactions within host cells. Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2000 coronaviruses and computed >100 000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The genomic regions display different degrees of conservation. SARS-CoV-2 domain encompassing nucleotides 22 500-23 000 is conserved both at the sequence and structural level. The regions upstream and downstream, however, vary significantly. This part of the viral sequence codes for the Spike S protein that interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, variability of Spike S is connected to different levels of viral entry in human cells within the population. Our predictions indicate that the 5' end of SARS-CoV-2 is highly structured and interacts with several human proteins. The binding proteins are involved in viral RNA processing, include double-stranded RNA specific editases and ATP-dependent RNA-helicases and have strong propensity to form stress granules and phase-separated assemblies. We propose that these proteins, also implicated in viral infections such as HIV, are selectively recruited by SARS-CoV-2 genome to alter transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of host cells and to promote viral replication."
9708,Harnessing the power of novel animal-free test methods for the development of COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.,"The COVID-19-inducing virus, SARS-CoV2, is likely to remain a threat to human health unless efficient drugs or vaccines become available. Given the extent of the current pandemic (people in over one hundred countries infected) and its disastrous effect on world economy (associated with limitations of human rights), speedy drug discovery is critical. In this situation, past investments into the development of new (animal-free) approach methods (NAM) for drug safety, efficacy, and quality evaluation can be leveraged. For this, we provide an overview of repurposing ideas to shortcut drug development times. Animal-based testing would be too lengthy, and it largely fails, when a pathogen is species-specific or if the desired drug is based on specific features of human biology. Fortunately, industry has already largely shifted to NAM, and some public funding programs have advanced the development of animal-free technologies. For instance, NAM can predict genotoxicity (a major aspect of carcinogenicity) within days, human antibodies targeting virus epitopes can be generated in molecular biology laboratories within weeks, and various human cell-based organoids are available to test virus infectivity and the biological processes controlling them. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has formed an expert group to pave the way for the use of such approaches for accelerated drug development. This situation illustrates the importance of diversification in drug discovery strategies and clearly shows the shortcomings of an approach that invests 95% of resources into a single technology (animal experimentation) in the face of challenges that require alternative approaches."
9709,Pathways between COVID-19 public health responses and increasing overdose risks: A rapid review and conceptual framework.,"Background: Emerging evidence indicates that illicit drug overdoses are increasing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a paucity of evidence on the causative pathways for this trend, but expert opinions, commentaries, and some reviews offer theoretical underpinnings. Methods: In this rapid review, we collate the available published evidence, expert opinions, commentaries, and reviews on the unintended pathways between COVID-19 public health responses and increasing illicit drug overdoses. Using tenets of thematic analyses and grounded theory, we also offer a visual conceptual framework for these unintended pathways. Results: Our framework focuses on five particular public health responses, namely social isolation/physical distancing/quarantine; staff/resource reallocations and reductions; closures of businesses and other places of employment; border closures and transportation restrictions; and the early release of people from prisons. As argued in the literature reviewed here, these public health responses have unintentionally created increased overdose risks by producing high risk use scenarios; increased risks of relapsing; disrupted addictions services and treatment; an increasingly toxic supply of drugs; and the risk of using with lowered tolerance. Conclusions: Health care systems should respond to these pathways to mitigate the unintended consequences. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may represent an opportunity to enact proactive, progressive, and innovative solutions to an overdose crisis that will surely outlast the current pandemic."
