5721,Justice through a Wide-Angle Lens.,"In the lead article of the May-June 2021 issue of the Hastings Center Report, Nancy Jecker and Caesar Atuire argue that the Covid-19 crisis is best understood as a syndemic, ""a convergence of biosocial forces that interact with one another to produce and exacerbate clinical disease and prognosis."" A syndemic framework, the authors advise, will enable bioethicists to recognize the ethical principles that should guide efforts to reduce the unequal effects that Covid-19 has on populations. Drawing on sub-Saharan African conceptions of solidarity, the authors lay out an approach to global vaccine distribution that prioritizes low- and middle-income countries. Like Jecker and Atuire's article, an essay by philosopher Keisha Ray pushes bioethicists to recognize broader justice-oriented responsibilities with the aid of a wide-angle lens. Ray's essay focuses on contemporary examples of environmental injustices that sicken, disable, or kill Black people."

5724,A Comparison of the Performance of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Assays in Healthcare Workers with COVID-19.,"Aims Since its emergence, significant interest surrounds the use of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests as an alternative or as an adjunct to molecular testing. However, given the speed of this pandemic, paralleled with the pressure to develop and provide serological tests in an expediated manner, not every assay has undergone the rigorous evaluation that is usually associated with medical diagnostic assays. We aimed to examine the performance of several commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assays among participants with confirmed COVID-19 disease and negative controls. Methods Serum taken between day 17 and day 40 post onset of symptoms from 41 healthcare workers with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease, and pre-pandemic serum from 20 negative controls, were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using 7 different assays including point-of-care (POC) and laboratory-based assays. Results Assay performance varied. The lab-based Abbott diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay proved to be the assay with the best positive and negative predictive value, and overall accuracy. The POC Nal von Minden GmbH and Biozek assays also performed well. Conclusion Our research demonstrates the variations in performance of several commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. These findings identify the limitations of some serological tests for SARS-CoV-2. This information will help inform test selection and may have particular relevance to providers operating beyond accredited laboratories."

5726,COVID-19 autopsy in people who died in community settings: the first series.,"Here, we report the pathological findings of nine complete autopsies of individuals who died in community settings in the UK, three of which were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), three tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but are likely false negatives, and three died of other respiratory infections. Autopsy revealed firm, consolidated lungs or lobar pneumonia. Histology of the lungs showed changes of diffuse alveolar damage with fibrin membrane formation, thickened alveolar walls and interstitium with lymphocytic infiltrate, and type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia with shedding into the alveolar space. This series is the first in the world to describe autopsy findings in individuals dying suddenly in the community, not previously known to have COVID-19 infection, and the first autopsy series in the UK. During a time when testing in the UK is currently primarily offered to patients in hospital or symptomatic key workers, with limited testing available in community settings, it highlights the importance of testing for COVID-19 at autopsy. Two deaths occurred in care homes where a diagnosis of COVID-19 allowed the health protection team to provide support in that 'closed setting' to reduce the risks of onward transmission. This work highlights the need for frequent COVID-19 testing in the management of patients in community settings. Comprehensive virology and microbiology assessment is pivotal to correctly identify the cause of death, including those due to COVID-19 infection, and to derive accurate death statistics."

5728,Evidence for residual SARS-CoV-2 in glioblastoma tissue of a convalescent patient.,"Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swept all over the world, several studies have shown the susceptibility of a patient with cancer to COVID-19. In this case, the removed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)-adjacent (GBM-A), GBM-peritumor and GBM-central (GBM-C) tissues from a convalescent patient of COVID-19, who also suffered from glioblastoma meanwhile, together with GBM-A and GBM tissues from a patient without COVID-19 history as negative controls, were used for RNA ISH, electron microscopy observing and immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 and the virus antigen (N protein). The results of RNA ISH, electron microscopy observing showed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects some cells within human GBM tissues and SARS-CoV-2 in GBM-C tissue still exists even when it is cleared elsewhere. Immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 and N protein showed that the expressions of ACE2 are significantly higher in specimens, including GBM-C tissue from COVID-19 patient than other types of tissue. The unique phenomenon suggests that the surgical protection level should be upgraded even if the patient is in a convalescent period and the pharyngeal swab tests show negative results. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to confirm whether the shelter-like phenomenon happens in other malignancies due to the similar microenvironment and high expression of ACE2 in some malignancies."
5729,Ultraviolet-induced in situ gold nanoparticles for point-of-care testing of infectious diseases in loop-mediated isothermal amplification.,"The present study investigated ultraviolet-induced in situ gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coupled with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the point-of-care testing (POCT) of two major infectious pathogens, namely, Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium spp.). In the process, gold ions in a gold chloride (HAuCl4) solution were reduced using trisodium citrate (Na3Ct), a reducing agent, and upon UV illumination, red-colored AuNPs were produced in the presence of LAMP amplicons. The nitrogenous bases of the target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) acted as a physical support for capturing gold ions dissolved in the sample. The high affinity of gold with the nitrogenous bases enabled facile detection within 10 min, and the detection limit of COVID-19 plasmid DNA was as low as 42 fg Î¼L-1. To ensure POCT, we designed a portable device that contained arrays of reagent chambers and detection chambers. In the portable device, colorimetric reagents such as HAuCl4 and Na3Ct were contained in the reagent chambers; these reagents were subsequently transferred to the detection chambers where LAMP amplicons were present and thus allowed convenient sample delivery and multiplex detection. Owing to the high sensitivity of the in situ AuNPs, simplicity of portable device fabrication, and rapid colorimetric detection, we strongly believe that the fabricated portable device could serve as a kit for rapid POCT for instantaneous detection of infectious diseases, and could be readily usable at the bedside."
