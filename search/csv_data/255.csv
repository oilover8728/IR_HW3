2541,In the service of the Filipino: the role of Catholic higher education institutions in promoting COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines.,There has been a stigma and hesitancy regarding COVID-19 vaccination in the Philippines. Many Filipinos are still hesitant to be vaccinated. This paper highlights the role of the Catholic Church as a powerful institution which can influence the people not only in spiritual aspect but also in promoting public health by motivating locals to get vaccinated. This task can be specifically done through the efforts of Catholic Higher Education Institutions (HEI) that place prominence and priority on social work and mission.

2543,RBD-Modified Bacterial Vesicles Elicited Potential Protective Immunity against SARS-CoV-2.,"The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection threatens human health. In this study, we used high-pressure homogenization technology not only to efficiently drive the bacterial membrane to produce artificial vesicles but also to force the fusion protein ClyA-receptor binding domain (RBD) to pass through gaps in the bacterial membrane to increase the contact between ClyA-RBD and the membrane. Therefore, the load of ClyA-RBD on the membrane is substantially increased. Using this technology, we constructed a ""ring-like"" bacterial biomimetic vesicle (BBV) loaded with polymerized RBD (RBD-BBV). RBD-BBVs injected subcutaneously can accumulate in lymph nodes, promote antigen uptake and processing, and elicit SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. In conclusion, we evaluated the potential of this novel bacterial vesicle as a vaccine delivery system and provided a new idea for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."
2544,"Forty days of regulatory emergency use authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines: Interfacing efficacy, hesitancy and SDG target 3.8.","The year 2020 will be synonymous with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for many global citizens. Millions have died from and tens of millions more have been infected globally by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has led to an urgent search for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments by the scientific and political communities and civil society. Through elements of events study and document and critical discourse analysis, this paper investigates the COVID-19 vaccines' regulatory emergency use authorisation and/or conditional marketing authorisation (regulatory authorisation) regimes and the contestations thereof. The key finding is that there was a regulatory authorisation rush, with at least 62, mostly high-income countries, doing so in 40 days from 2 December 2020-10 January 2021. This has led to one senior USA official describing the United Kingdom pioneer regulatory authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as 'too quick'. Regulatory authorisation regimes took place amid severe civil society contestations and appropriate political pressure. The paper recommends that as the COVID-19 vaccines' regulatory authorisation continue in 2021, national vaccines and treatments regulatory bodies must be informed by science, with governments, civil society, politicians and other key stakeholders taking responsibility to educate the masses and continue taking the necessary precautions."
2545,Comprehensive O-Glycosylation Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein with Biomimetic Trp-Arg Materials.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health threat. Most vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 target the highly glycosylated spike protein (S). A good knowledge of the glycosylation profile of this protein is key to successful vaccine development. Unlike the 22 confirmed N-glycosylation sites on SARS-CoV-2 S, only a few O-glycosylation sites on this protein have been reported. This difference is mainly ascribed to the extremely low stoichiometry of O-glycosylation. Herein, we designed the biomimetic materials, Trp-Arg (WR) monomer-grafted silica microspheres (designated as WR-SiO2), and these biomimetic materials can enrich N- and O-linked glycopeptides with high selectivity. And WR-SiO2 can resist the nonglycopeptides' interference with the 100 molar fold of BSA during O-linked glycopeptide enrichment. We utilized WR-SiO2 to comprehensively analyze the O-glycosylation profile of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S. Twenty-seven O-glycosylation sites including 18 unambiguous sites are identified on SARS-CoV-2 S. Our study demonstrates that the biomimetic polymer can offer specific selectivity for O-linked glycopeptides and pave the way for O-glycosylation research in biological fields. The O-glycosylation profile of SARS-CoV-2 S might supplement the comprehensive glycosylation in addition to N-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S."

2547,Portable chest X-ray in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19): A pictorial review.,"As the global pandemic of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) progresses, many physicians in a wide variety of specialties continue to play pivotal roles in diagnosis and management. In radiology, much of the literature to date has focused on chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 (Zhou et al. [1]; Chung et al. [2]). However, due to infection control issues related to patient transport to CT suites, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in parts of the world, portable chest radiography (CXR) will likely be the most commonly utilized modality for identification and follow up of lung abnormalities. In fact, the American College of Radiology (ACR) notes that CT decontamination required after scanning COVID-19 patients may disrupt radiological service availability and suggests that portable chest radiography may be considered to minimize the risk of cross-infection (American College of Radiology [3]). Furthermore, in cases of high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, a positive CXR may obviate the need for CT. Additionally, CXR utilization for early disease detection may also play a vital role in areas around the world with limited access to reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID testing. The purpose of this pictorial review article is to describe the most common manifestations and patterns of lung abnormality on CXR in COVID-19 in order to equip the medical community in its efforts to combat this pandemic."

2549,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pediatric healthcare workers.,"Objectives: To determine SARS-CoV-2-antibody prevalence in pediatric healthcare workers (pHCWs). Design: Baseline prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG was assessed in a prospective cohort study from a large pediatric healthcare facility. Prior SARS-CoV-2 testing history, potential risk factors and anxiety level about COVID-19 were determined. Prevalence difference between emergency department (ED)-based and non-ED-pHCWs was modeled controlling for those covariates. Chi-square test-for-trend was used to examine prevalence by month of enrollment. Results: Most of 642 pHCWs enrolled were 31-40years, female and had no comorbidities. Half had children in their home, 49% had traveled, 42% reported an illness since January, 31% had a known COVID-19 exposure, and 8% had SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. High COVID-19 pandemic anxiety was reported by 71%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was 4.1%; 8.4% among ED versus 2.0% among non-ED pHCWs (p < 0.001). ED-work location and known COVID-19 exposure were independent risk factors. 31% of antibody-positive pHCWs reported no symptoms. Prevalence significantly (p < 0.001) increased from 3.0% in April-June to 12.7% in July-August. Conclusions: Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was low in pHCWs but increased rapidly over time. Both working in the ED and exposure to a COVID-19-positive contact were associated with antibody-seropositivity. Ongoing universal PPE utilization is essential. These data may guide vaccination policies to protect front-line workers."
