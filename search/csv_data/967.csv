9660,"Impact of a Nationwide Lockdown on SARS-CoV-2 Transmissibility, Italy.","On March 11, 2020, Italy imposed a national lockdown to curtail the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We estimate that, 14 days after lockdown, the net reproduction number had dropped below 1 and remained stable at Â»0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.85) in all regions for >3 of the following weeks."
9661,Recent trends on omics and bioinformatics approaches to study SARS-CoV-2: A bibliometric analysis and mini-review.,"Background: The successful sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 cleared the way for the use of omics technologies and integrative biology research for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, many research groups have slowed down their respective projects to concentrate efforts in the study of the biology of SARS-CoV-2. In this bibliometric analysis and mini-review, we aimed to describe how computational methods or omics approaches were used during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We analyzed bibliometric data from Scopus, BioRxiv, and MedRxiv (dated June 19th, 2020) using quantitative and knowledge mapping approaches. We complemented our analysis with a manual process of carefully reading the selected articles to identify either the omics or bioinformatic tools used and their purpose. Results: From a total of 184 articles, we found that metagenomics and transcriptomics were the main sources of data to perform phylogenetic analysis aimed at corroborating zoonotic transmission, identifying the animal origin and taxonomic allocation of SARS-CoV-2. Protein sequence analysis, immunoinformatics and molecular docking were used to give insights about SARS-CoV-2 targets for drug and vaccine development. Most of the publications were from China and USA. However, China, Italy and India covered the top 10 most cited papers on this topic. Conclusion: We found an abundance of publications using omics and bioinformatics approaches to establish the taxonomy and animal origin of SARS-CoV-2. We encourage the growing community of researchers to explore other lesser-known aspects of COVID-19 such as virus-host interactions and host response."
9662,[Transmission of Coronavirus via Aerosols and Influence of Environmental Conditions on Its Transmission].,"The COVID-19 pandemic has endangered human health and production since 2019. As an emerging disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, its potential transmissibility via aerosols has caused heated debate. This work summarizes the current research findings on virus aerosol generation, aerodynamic properties, and environmental influencing factors on their survivability in order to elucidate coronavirus transmission via aerosols. The occurrence and distinction of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV in real atmospheric environments are summarized. The deficiencies of existing research and directions for necessary future research on confirming the airborne transmission mechanism of coronavirus as well as the need for multidisciplinary research are discussed."
9663,A Review on 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in Ophthalmology.,"Purpose: To investigate the possibility of ocular involvement in the 2019-novel coronavirus infectious (2019-nCoV) and vital preventive measures in the field of ophthalmology. Methods: All the studies that were most relevant to the 2019-nCoV ocular involvement and routes of transmission, especially in the field of ophthalmology, thoroughly reviewed. Results: From the ocular perspective, conjunctivitis may be the first presenting symptom of 2019-nCoV, so, we as ophthalmologists are at the forefront of exposure with newly infected patients. Although transconjunctival aerosol is a suspected but, the main route of transmission is the known respiratory droplets which will be more significant due to close contact in the field of ophthalmology. This review advise a set of recommendation for preventive care to minimize cross-infection of 2019-nCoV. Conclusions: Ophthalmologists have an essential role in guiding cross-infection control measures between patients and staff. Until a vaccine is created, public health strategies are likely the best weapons against this invisible enemy."
9664,[Recommendations for use of the diverse tests for detection of SARS-COV-2 infection].,"In the current crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is a global need to know and combat the virus. One of the strategies is to track and diagnose cases in order to isolate and interrupt the epidemiological chain. Therefore, the aim of this article is to describe the different most used diagnostic tests and analyze their validity and indications for use according to scientific evidence and the main recommendations of scientific societies and reference organizations at national and international level. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the availability of tests has been subject to the conditions of the manufacturing market itself and to the guidelines set in each country. Among the most used types of tests, it is worth highlighting PCR, antibody detection tests (IgG and IGM) and total antibodies (Ab), also known as rapid tests, and tests for the detection of antigens in nasopharyngeal exudate or other upper/lower respiratory samples. For each of these tests, it is necessary to know their recommendations for use and the procedure for taking samples, which is essential to minimize alterations in the results due to poor handling. Likewise, it is necessary to determine the most appropriate moment for taking samples and their adequate interpretation of the results obtained, which must always be considered together with the patient's symptoms for clinical decision-making."
9665,Disparities in SARS-CoV-2 Positivity Rates: Associations with Race and Ethnicity.,"Numerous reports indicate that African Americans and Latinos are being affected disproportionately by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Positivity rates have not been analyzed on scale because only 4 states report race/ethnicity as part of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing. Previous studies also have had little ability to control for many known risk factors to better identify the effects of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic communities. Using test results from a large national reference laboratory database that included patients from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, this study compared positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) among various race/ethnicity groups by linking zip code-based race/ethnicity proportions from US Census data. Analysis of 2,331,175 unique patients tested March-May 2020 demonstrated an increasing trend in SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity across Black non-Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 7.8% to 17.2%, P < 0.0001) and Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 8.4% to 15.5%, P < 0.0001) and a decreasing trend across White non-Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 17.4% to 7.1%, P < 0.0001). These trends in viral ribonucleic acid positivity remained in stratified analyses and in multivariable models that controlled for known risk factors including sex, population density, and the states initially hardest hit by COVID-19. These findings indicate that communities with the highest proportions of Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic populations have the highest SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity rates, even after controlling for other risk factors. More efforts are needed to mitigate the increased impact of COVID-19 on both the African American and Hispanic communities."
9666,COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: A possible associative approach towards neurodegenerative diseases.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), has kept the globe in disquiets due to its severe life-threatening conditions. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, sore throat, and shortness of breath. According to the anecdotal reports from the health care workers, it has been suggested that the virus could reach the brain and can cause anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and hypopsia. Once the SARS-CoV-2 has entered the central nervous system (CNS), it can either exit in an inactive form in the tissues or may lead to neuroinflammation. Here, we aim to discuss the chronic infection of the olfactory bulb region of the brain by SARS-CoV-2 and how this could affect the nearby residing neurons in the host. We further review the probable cellular mechanism and activation of the microglia 1 phenotype possibly leading to various neurodegenerative disorders. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 might probably infect the olfactory bulb neuron enervating the nasal epithelium accessing the CNS and might cause neurodegenerative diseases in the future."
9667,SARS-CoV-2 pandemia in Lombardy: the impact on family Paediatricians.,"As health care workers (HCWs) who care for children, who usually demonstrate milder symptoms than adults, family paediatricians have an increased risk of exposure to coronavirus. In April 2020, the Sindacato Medici Pediatri di Famiglia (SIMPeF), provided its members with rapid tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; 1240 individuals, including 377 paediatricians, 108 staff members of pediatric clinics, and 755 cohabitant relatives of paediatricians, were tested in Lombardy, the most affected Italian region. The global prevalence of IgG antibodies in these individuals was 20.7%, which is higher than that of the general population and other HCWs. More than 70% of subjects with IgG antibodies presented symptoms, and 4.9% needed hospitalization. In addition, 64.2% of the study participants reported close contacts with a suspected case of COVID-19, while 72.9% of the family paediatricians reported occupational exposure to the disease. The initiative of the SIMPeF has been useful in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric settings, as well as in raising paediatricians' awareness of the spreading of coronavirus."
9668,Potential Antigenic Cross-reactivity Between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Dengue Viruses.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and dengue fever are difficult to distinguish given shared clinical and laboratory features. Failing to consider COVID-19 due to false-positive dengue serology can have serious implications. We aimed to assess this possible cross-reactivity. Methods: We analyzed clinical data and serum samples from 55 individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To assess dengue serology status, we used dengue-specific antibodies by means of lateral-flow rapid test, as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, we tested SARS-CoV-2 serology status in patients with dengue and performed in-silico protein structural analysis to identify epitope similarities. Results: Using the dengue lateral-flow rapid test we detected 12 positive cases out of the 55 (21.8%) COVID-19 patients versus zero positive cases in a control group of 70 healthy individuals (P = 2.5E-5). This includes 9 cases of positive immunoglobulin M (IgM), 2 cases of positive immunoglobulin G (IgG), and 1 case of positive IgM as well as IgG antibodies. ELISA testing for dengue was positive in 2 additional subjects using envelope protein directed antibodies. Out of 95 samples obtained from patients diagnosed with dengue before September 2019, SARS-CoV-2 serology targeting the S protein was positive/equivocal in 21 (22%) (16 IgA, 5 IgG) versus 4 positives/equivocal in 102 controls (4%) (P = 1.6E-4). Subsequent in-silico analysis revealed possible similarities between SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in the HR2 domain of the spike protein and the dengue envelope protein. Conclusions: Our findings support possible cross-reactivity between dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2, which can lead to false-positive dengue serology among COVID-19 patients and vice versa. This can have serious consequences for both patient care and public health."
9669,CoV3D: a database of high resolution coronavirus protein structures.,"SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, exemplifies the general threat to global health posed by coronaviruses. The urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. To assist structure-based design of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we have developed CoV3D, a database and resource for coronavirus protein structures, which is updated on a weekly basis. CoV3D provides users with comprehensive sets of structures of coronavirus proteins and their complexes with antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Integrated molecular viewers allow users to visualize structures of the spike glycoprotein, which is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine design efforts, as well as sets of spike-antibody complexes, spike sequence variability, and known polymorphisms. In order to aid structure-based design and analysis of the spike glycoprotein, CoV3D permits visualization and download of spike structures with modeled N-glycosylation at known glycan sites, and contains structure-based classification of spike conformations, generated by unsupervised clustering. CoV3D can serve the research community as a centralized reference and resource for spike and other coronavirus protein structures, and is available at: https://cov3d.ibbr.umd.edu."
