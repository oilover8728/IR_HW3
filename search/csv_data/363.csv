3620,Prospects for durable immune control of SARS-CoV-2 and prevention of reinfection.,"Immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is central to long-term control of the current pandemic. Despite our rapidly advancing knowledge of immune memory to SARS-CoV-2, understanding how these responses translate into protection against reinfection at both the individual and population levels remains a major challenge. An ideal outcome following infection or after vaccination would be a highly protective and durable immunity that allows for the establishment of high levels of population immunity. However, current studies suggest a decay of neutralizing antibody responses in convalescent patients, and documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection are increasing. Understanding the dynamics of memory responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the mechanisms of immune control are crucial for the rational design and deployment of vaccines and for understanding the possible future trajectories of the pandemic. Here, we summarize our current understanding of immune responses to and immune control of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications for prevention of reinfection."

3623,Optimal preparation of SARS-CoV-2 viral transport medium for culture.,"Introduction: The sudden arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic placed significant stresses on supply chains including viral transport medium (VTM). The VTM that was urgently required needed to support viral replication, as well as other routine diagnostic approaches. We describe the preparation and validation testing of VTM for rapidly expanding diagnostic testing, where the capacity of the VTM to preserve viral integrity, for culture, isolation and full sequence analysis, was maintained. Methods: VTM was prepared using different methods of sterilization then 'spiked' with virus. The VTM was investigated using viral culture in Vero cells, and for nucleic acid detection by quantitative PCR. Results: The best results were obtained by filter and autoclave-based sterilization. The VTM proved robust for culture-based analyses provided the inoculated VTM was stored at 4 Â°C, and tested within 48 h. The filtered VTM also supported PCR-based diagnosis for at least 5 days when the mock inoculated VTM was held at room temperature. Discussion: The manual handling of VTM production, including filling and sterilization, was optimized. SARS-CoV-2 was spiked into VTM to assess different sterilization methods and measure the effects of storage time and temperature upon VTM performance. While most diagnostic protocols will not require replication competent virus, the use of high quality VTM will allow for the next phase of laboratory analysis in the COVID-19 pandemic, including drug and antibody susceptibility analysis of re-isolated SARS-CoV-2, and for the testing of vaccine escape mutants."
3624,SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccination in dermatology patients on immunomodulatory and biologic agents: Recommendations from the Australasian Medical Dermatology Group.,"As the phase III COVID-19 vaccine trials excluded patients on immunosuppressive treatments, or patients with significant autoimmunity, the Australasian Medical Dermatology Group make the following preliminary recommendations around COVID-19 vaccination in dermatology patients on immunomodulatory and/or biologic agents. Vaccination against COVID-19 is strongly encouraged for all patients on immunomodulatory drugs and/or biologic agents. There are currently insufficient data to recommend one COVID-19 vaccine or vaccine type (mRNA, recombinant, inactivated virus) over another. No specific additional risk in patients on immunomodulatory or biologic therapies has so far been identified. Data on vaccine efficacy in patients on immunomodulatory or biologic therapies are missing, so standard vaccination protocols are recommended until otherwise advised."
3625,Possible vertical transmission and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among infants born to mothers with COVID-19: A living systematic review.,"Current evidence suggests that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is predominantly transmitted from human-to-human. However, evidence on vertical transmission and natural passive immunity among the newborns exposed to COVID-19 is scanty and varies. This poses a challenge on preventive interventions for the newborns. We conducted a systematic review to first, determine the likelihood of vertical transmission among COVID-19 exposed infants and second, determine whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were generated among COVID-19 vertically exposed but negative infants. This review registered in PROSPERO searched evidence from PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar, among others. About 517 studies were pooled, where 33 articles (5.8%) met the inclusion criteria such as infection prevention and control measures at birth. A total of 205 infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers were studied. Overall, 6.3% (13/205; 95% CI: 3.0%-9.7%) of the infants tested positive for COVID-19 virus at birth. Of 33 eligible studies, six studies (18.8%) reported about immunoglobulin G/M (IgG/IgM) against SARS-CoV-2. IgG/IgM were detected in 90% infants (10/11; 95% CI: 73.9%-107.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 virus. The median antibody levels detected were 75.49 AU/ml (range, 7.25-140.32 AU/ml) and 3.79 AU/ml (range, 0.16-45.83 AU/ml), p = .0041 for IgG and IgM, respectively. In conclusion, the current evidence revealed a low possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected among vertically exposed but negative infants. Further studies on transplacental transmission and the magnitude of natural passive immunity in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are warranted."

3627,"Epidemiology of coronaviruses, genetics, vaccines, and scenario of current pandemic of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19): a fuzzy set approach.","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with a range of respiratory complications. In the last two decades, three major outbreaks have been reported due to HCoVs including the current pandemic. In December 2019, a newly emerged virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan city, China. This paper presents a detailed review of the literature and discusses the uncertain spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using fuzzy set as classical set theory logic to measure uncertainty and vagueness of COVID-19 in China. Our findings show that both infection and death rate touched the peak (normal fuzzy sets) and have shown a decline. The graphs are not convex, which shows that there remains much uncertainty in the spread of COVID-19. Effective vaccines are clearly needed to control and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic."

3629,"Steps, implementation and importance of quality management in diagnostic laboratories with special emphasis on coronavirus disease-2019.","A well-established and functional quality management system is an integral part of any diagnostic laboratory. It assures the reliability and standards of the laboratory function. A pandemic situation such as that caused by the influenza H1N1 2009 virus or the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) increases the demands on the public health system, and the need to build, upgrade and expand the number of diagnostic laboratories. The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 unleashed a public health emergency of an unprecedented scale. The need has been highlighted for the accreditation of tests relating to COVID-19 by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) or any agencies approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) or Indian Council of Medical Research. The implementation of quality system in diagnostic laboratories would ensure accurate, reliable and efficient test results at par with the international standards. The functional aspects of a laboratory such as a well-defined organogram, standard operating procedures, good laboratory practices, quality controls, human resources, equipment management, reagents, inventory of records, proper communication need to be addressed to assure quality. Biosafety considerations should include the guidelines laid out by the WHO, the Institutional Biosafety Committee and the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India for carrying out diagnostic work in the laboratory. Currently, there are 1922 laboratories, operational for COVID-19 diagnosis in India. Considering the urgency of testing, the NABL has expedited the process of accreditation and issued accreditation to 818 laboratories. The adherence to the practicable aspects of quality described in this article would help in establishing quality in COVID-19 testing laboratories."
