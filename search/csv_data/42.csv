410,A comparison on the percentage of polymerase chain reaction positivity for SARS-CoV-2 between Public Health Center referrals and direct walk-in patients: A single center retrospective analysis in Tokyo.,"Introduction: The Public Health Center (PHC)-known as hokenjo in Japan-assume a crucial role in disease control. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of many designated infectious diseases monitored by the agency. During the present pandemic, patients who suspected COVID-19 were instructed to call the Coronavirus Consultation Center in the PHC prior to visiting the hospital. The aim of this study was to elucidate the differences in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity between PHC referrals and direct walk-in patients. Methods: The present was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted at the Tokyo Metropolitan Hospital from March to September, 2020. Patients who received a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 were included and categorized into the PHC referral or direct walk-in groups. The outcomes included the total number of patients undergoing PCR tests and the percentage of PCR positivity in each group. Results: We identified 1680 patients (781 PHC referred and 899 direct walk-in groups). The percentage of PCR positivity did not significantly differ between the PHC referral and direct walk-in groups during the first wave (30.5% vs. 29.2%; p = 0.78). PCR positivity was significantly higher in the PHC referral group than the direct walk-in group during the second wave (30.1% vs. 23.1%; p = 0.051) and entire study period (30.2% vs. 24.7%; p = 0.011). Conclusions: Despite health authority recommendations, the number of direct walk-in patients were higher than PHC referral patients. The percentage of PCR positivity was significantly higher in the PHC referral group than in the direct walk-in group."
411,Accuracy and cost description of rapid antigen test compared with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 detection.,"Introduction: Fast and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is essential in limiting the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid antigen (AG) tests provide results within minutes; however, their accuracy has been questioned. The study aims to determine the accuracy and cost of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 AG test compared with RT-PCR. Methods: Individuals 18 years or older with an appointment for a RT-PCR test on 26-31 December 2020 at a public test centre in Copenhagen, Denmark were invited to participate. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR analysis, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab examined by the AG test (SD Biosensor). The diagnostic accuracy of the AG test was calculated with RT-PCR as reference. Costs were evaluated for both tests. Results: A total of 4,811 paired conclusive test results were collected (median age: 45 years, female: 53%). The RT-PCR test revealed 221 (4.6%) positive tests. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the AG test were 69.7% and 99.5%, respectively. Viral cycle threshold values were significantly higher in individuals with false negative AG tests than in individuals who were true positives. The RT-PCR test and AG test costs were 67.0 DKK (10.8 USD) and 35.0 DKK (5.7 USD), respectively, per positive case detected at 100,000 daily tests. Conclusions: The AG test enables mass testing and provides immediate results, which is important in SARS-CoV-2 screening. The AG test is a good and relevant supplement to RT-PCR testing in public SARS-CoV-2 screenings. Funding: This project received no external funding. Copenhagen Medical A/S delivering the rapid AG tests and provided test personnel but were not otherwise involved. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.org: NCT04716088."
412,Proteinase K treatment in absence of RNA isolation classical procedures is a quick and cheaper alternative for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a pandemic of COVID-19, the disease caused by the recently described SARS-CoV-2. The relevance and importance of mass diagnosis in order to find the asymptomatic individuals is widely recognized as a mandatory tool to reinforce the control measures for monitoring virus circulation and reduce the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we described quickness and cheaper strategies of direct RT-qPCR (in the absence of RNA isolation) and compared the results to those obtained using standard RNA isolation procedure. The tests varied using pure, diluted samples, combined with Proteinase K (PK) or Lysis Buffer. Our findings showed consistently that PK pre-treated samples in the absence of RNA extraction procedures presents similar results to those obtained by standard RNA isolation procedures. On average, 16 samples extracted with the MagMAX™ CORE Kit, take around 2 h, costing an average of USD 5, the pre-treatment of samples using PK, on the other hand, would cut the value to less than USD 0.30 and reduce the time of procedure in more than 1 ½ hours. The present study suggests the use of PK treatment instead of RNA isolation in order to reduce costs and time in processing samples for molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2."
413,"Test, trace, isolate: evidence for declining SARS-CoV-2 PCR sensitivity in a clinical cohort.","Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on upper respiratory tract (URT) samples is the primary method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections and guide public health measures, with a supportive role for serology. We reinforce previous findings on limited sensitivity of PCR testing, and solidify this fact by statistically utilizing a firm basis of multiple tests per individual. We integrate stratifications with respect to several patient characteristics such as severity of disease and time since onset of symptoms. Bayesian statistical modelling was used to retrospectively determine the sensitivity of RT-PCR using SARS-CoV-2 serology in 644 COVID-19-suspected patients with varying degrees of disease severity and duration. The sensitivity of RT-PCR ranged between 80% - 95%; increasing with disease severity, it decreased rapidly over time in mild COVID-19 cases. Negative URT RT-PCR results should be interpreted in the context of clinical characteristics, especially with regard to containment of viral transmission based on 'test, trace and isolate'. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, RT-PCR, serology, sensitivity, public health."
414,Reverse Transcription Recombinase-Aided Amplification Assay With Lateral Flow Dipstick Assay for Rapid Detection of 2019 Novel Coronavirus.,"Background: The emerging Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has challenged the public health globally. With the increasing requirement of detection for SARS-CoV-2 outside of the laboratory setting, a rapid and precise Point of Care Test (POCT) is urgently needed. Methods: Targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2, specific primers, and probes for reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification coupled with lateral flow dipstick (RT-RAA/LFD) platform were designed. For specificity evaluation, it was tested with human coronaviruses, human influenza A virus, influenza B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and hepatitis B virus, respectively. For sensitivity assay, it was estimated by templates of recombinant plasmid and pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. For clinical assessment, 100 clinical samples (13 positive and 87 negatives for SARS-CoV-2) were tested via quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and RT-RAA/LFD, respectively. Results: The limit of detection was 1 copies/μl in RT-RAA/LFD assay, which could be conducted within 30 min at 39°C, without any cross-reaction with other human coronaviruses and clinical respiratory pathogens. Compared with RT-qPCR, the established POCT assay offered 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in the detection of clinical samples. Conclusion: This work provides a convenient POCT tool for rapid screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of suspected patients in SARS-CoV-2 endemic areas."
415,Variability of cycle threshold values in an external quality assessment scheme for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome by RT-PCR.,"Objectives: The qualitative results of SARS-CoV-2 specific real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR are used for initial diagnosis and follow-up of Covid-19 patients and asymptomatic virus carriers. However, clinical decision-making and health management policies often are based additionally on cycle threshold (Ct) values (i.e., quantitative results) to guide patient care, segregation and discharge management of individuals testing positive. Therefore, an analysis of inter-protocol variability is needed to assess the comparability of the quantitative results. Methods: Ct values reported in a SARS-CoV-2 virus genome detection external quality assessment challenge were analyzed. Three positive and two negative samples were distributed to participating test laboratories. Qualitative results (positive/negative) and quantitative results (Ct values) were assessed. Results: A total of 66 laboratories participated, contributing results from 101 distinct test systems and reporting Ct values for a total of 92 different protocols. In all three positive samples, the means of the Ct values for the E-, N-, S-, RdRp-, and ORF1ab-genes varied by less than two cycles. However, 7.7% of reported results deviated by more than ±4.0 (maximum 18.0) cycles from the respective individual means. These larger deviations appear to be systematic errors. Conclusions: In an attempt to use PCR diagnostics beyond the identification of infected individuals, laboratories are frequently requested to report Ct values along with a qualitative result. This study highlights the limitations of interpreting Ct values from the various SARS-CoV genome detection protocols and suggests that standardization is necessary in the reporting of Ct values with respect to the target gene."
416,"Analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of a triplex RT-qPCR assay using CDC N1, N2, and RP targets for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","Background: Several RT-qPCR kits are available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and some have emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. In particular, the nCoV19 CDC kit includes two targets for detecting SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2) and an RNaseP (RP) target for RNA extraction quality control, all of which are labeled with FAM, and thus three PCR reactions are required per sample. Methods: We designed a triplex RT-qPCR assay based on nCoV19 primers and probes where N1, N2, and RP are labeled with FAM, HEX, and Cy5, respectively, so only a single PCR reaction is required for each sample for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Results: In total, 172 samples were analyzed in both singleplex and triplex assays, where 86 samples tested SARS-CoV-2 negative with both assays, so the triplex assay specificity was 100%. In addition, 86 samples tested SARS-Co-V 2 positive with the singleplex assay and 84 with the triplex assay, so the sensitivity was 97.7%. The limit of detection for the triplex assay was determined as 1000 copies/mL. Conclusions: This new triplex RT-qPCR assay based on primers and probes from the CDC protocol is highly reliable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, and it could speed up detection and save reagents during the current SARS-CoV-2 testing supplies shortage."
417,Comparability of six different immunoassays measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with neutralizing antibody levels in convalescent plasma: From utility to prediction.,"Background: Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) provides virus-neutralizing antibodies that may ameliorate the outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The effectiveness of CP likely depends on its antiviral neutralizing potency and is determined using in vitro neutralizing antibody assays. Study design and methods: We evaluated abilities of three immunoassays for anti-spike antibodies (EUROimmun, Ortho, Roche), a pseudotype-based neutralization assay, and two assays that quantify ACE2 binding of spike protein (GenScript and hemagglutination test [HAT]-based assay) to predict neutralizing antibody titers in 113 CP donations. Assay outputs were analyzed through linear regression and calculation of sensitivities and specificities by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Median values of plasma samples containing neutralizing antibodies produced conversion factors for assay unitage of ×6.5 (pseudotype), ×19 (GenScript), ×3.4 (HAT assay), ×0.08 (EUROimmun), ×1.64 (Roche), and ×0.10 (Ortho). All selected assays were sufficient in identifying the high titer donations based on ROC analysis; area over curve ranged from 91.7% for HAT and GenScript assay to 95.6% for pseudotype assay. However, their ability to predict the actual neutralizing antibody levels varied substantially as shown by linear regression correlation values (from 0.27 for Ortho to 0.61 for pseudotype assay). Discussion: Overall, the study data demonstrate that all selected assays were effective in identifying donations with high neutralizing antibody levels and are potentially suitable as surrogate assays for donation selection for CP therapy."
418,Clinical Application of the Novel Cell-Based Biosensor for the Ultra-Rapid Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 Spike Protein Antigen: A Practical Approach.,"The availability of antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 represents a major step for the mass surveillance of the incidence of infection, especially regarding COVID-19 asymptomatic and/or early-stage patients. Recently, we reported the development of a Bioelectric Recognition Assay-based biosensor able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus in just three minutes, with high sensitivity and selectivity. The working principle was established by measuring the change of the electric potential of membrane-engineered mammalian cells bearing the human chimeric spike S1 antibody after attachment of the respective viral protein. In the present study, we applied the novel biosensor to patient-derived nasopharyngeal samples in a clinical set-up, with absolutely no sample pretreatment. More importantly, membrane-engineered cells were pre-immobilized in a proprietary biomatrix, thus enabling their long-term preservation prior to use as well as significantly increasing their ease-of-handle as test consumables. The plug-and-apply novel biosensor was able to detect the virus in positive samples with a 92.8% success rate compared to RT-PCR. No false negative results were recorded. These findings demonstrate the potential applicability of the biosensor for the early, routine mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 on a scale not yet realized."
419,RT-PCR Screening Tests for SARS-CoV-2 with Saliva Samples in Asymptomatic People: Strategy to Maintain Social and Economic Activities while Reducing the Risk of Spreading the Virus.,"The year 2020 will be remembered for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which continues to affect the whole world. Early and accurate identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is fundamental to combat the disease. Among the current diagnostic tests, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most reliable and frequently used method. Herein, we discuss the interpretation of RT-qPCR results relative to viral infectivity. Although nasopharyngeal swab samples are often used for RT-qPCR testing, they require collection by trained medical staff. Saliva samples are emerging as an inexpensive and efficient alternative for large-scale screening. Pooled-sample testing of saliva has been applied for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Current policies recommend isolating people with borderline cycle threshold (Ct) values (35<Ct <40), despite these Ct values indicating minimal infection risk. We propose the new concept of a ""social cut-off"" Ct value and risk stratification based on the correlation of Ct with infectivity. We also describe the experience of RT-qPCR screening of saliva samples at our institution. It is important to implement a scientific approach to minimize viral transmission while allowing economic and social activities to continue."
