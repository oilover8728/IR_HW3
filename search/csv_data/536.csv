5350,"Microstructure, pathophysiology, and potential therapeutics of COVID-19: A comprehensive review.","There have been over seven million cases and almost 413 372 deaths globally due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated disease COVID-19, as of 11 June 2020. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that there is a common source for these infections. The overall sequence similarities between the spike protein of 2019-nCoV and that of SARS-CoV are known to be around 76% to 78% and 73% to 76% for the whole protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. Thus, they have the potential to serve as the drug and/or vaccine candidate. However, the individual response against 2019-nCoV differs due to genetic variations in the human population. Understanding the variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that may affect the severity of 2019-nCoV infection could help in identifying individuals at a higher risk from the COVID-19. A number of potential drugs/vaccines as well as antibody/cytokine-based therapeutics are in various developmental stages of preclinical/clinical trials against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV with substantial cross-reactivity, and may be used against COVID-19. For diagnosis, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard test for initial diagnosis of COVID-19. A kit based on serological tests are also recommended for investigating the spread of COVID-19 but this is challenging due to the antibodies cross-reactivity. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent reports available regarding the host-pathogen interaction, morphological and genomic structure of the virus, and the diagnostic techniques as well as the available potential therapeutics against COVID-19."
5351,Evaluation of Specimen Types and Saliva Stabilization Solutions for SARS-CoV-2 Testing.,"Identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections through aggressive diagnostic testing remains critical to tracking and curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), the preferred sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, has become difficult due to the dramatic increase in testing and consequent supply strain. Therefore, alternative specimen types have been investigated that provide similar detection sensitivity with reduced health care exposure and the potential for self-collection. In this study, the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs (NS) and saliva was compared to that of NPS using matched specimens from two outpatient cohorts in New York State (total n = 463). The first cohort showed only a 5.4% positivity, but the second cohort (n = 227) had a positivity rate of 41%, with sensitivity in NPS, NS, and saliva of 97.9%, 87.1%, and 87.1%, respectively. Whether the reduced sensitivity of NS or saliva is acceptable must be assessed in the settings where they are used. However, we sought to improve on it by validating a method to mix the two sample types, as the combination of nasal swab and saliva resulted in 94.6% SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity. Spiking experiments showed that combining them did not adversely affect the detection sensitivity in either. Virus stability in saliva was also investigated, with and without the addition of commercially available stabilizing solutions. The virus was stable in saliva at both 4°C and room temperature for up to 7 days. The addition of stabilizing solutions did not enhance stability and, in some situations, reduced detectable virus levels."
5352,"The Vital Role of a Federally Qualified Community Health Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their mission of providing essential medical care to underserved populations is now even more vital. CrescentCare, an FQHC in New Orleans, evaluated and tested 3366 patients between March 16 and July 2, with an overall rate of 12% SARS-CoV-2 positivity. The clinic's experience demonstrates how to effectively and rapidly integrate COVID-19 programing, while preserving essential health services. Strategies include developing a walk-in COVID-19 testing site, ensuring appropriate clinical evaluation, providing accurate public health information, and advocating for job safety on behalf of our patients."
5353,Humoral immune response to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants elicited by inactivated and RBD-subunit vaccines.,"SARS-CoV-2 variants could induce immune escape by mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD). Here we report the humoral immune response to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), of the plasma and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) elicited by CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine), ZF2001 (RBD-subunit vaccine) and natural infection. Among 86 potent NAbs identified by high-throughput single-cell VDJ sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinees and convalescents, near half anti-RBD NAbs showed major neutralization reductions against the K417N/E484K/N501Y mutation combination, with E484K being the dominant cause. VH3-53/VH3-66 recurrent antibodies respond differently to RBD variants, and K417N compromises the majority of neutralizing activity through reduced polar contacts with complementarity determining regions. In contrast, the 242-244 deletion (242-244Δ) would abolish most neutralization activity of anti-NTD NAbs by interrupting the conformation of NTD antigenic supersite, indicating a much less diversity of anti-NTD NAbs than anti-RBD NAbs. Plasma of convalescents and CoronaVac vaccinees displayed comparable neutralization reductions against pseudo- and authentic 501Y.V2 variants, mainly caused by E484K/N501Y and 242-244Δ, with the effects being additive. Importantly, RBD-subunit vaccinees exhibit markedly higher tolerance to 501Y.V2 than convalescents, since the elicited anti-RBD NAbs display a high diversity and are unaffected by NTD mutations. Moreover, an extended gap between the third and second doses of ZF2001 leads to better neutralizing activity and tolerance to 501Y.V2 than the standard three-dose administration. Together, these results suggest that the deployment of RBD-vaccines, through a third-dose boost, may be ideal for combating SARS-CoV-2 variants when necessary, especially for those carrying mutations that disrupt the NTD supersite."
5354,Aspirin Is Related to Worse Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19.,"Backgroundand Objectives: Aspirin is used globally to reduce pain and inflammation; however, its effect in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is not fully investigated and remains controversial. We evaluated the association between aspirin and COVID-19 outcomes using nationwide data from the Korean National Health Insurance System. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study that included 22,660 eligible patients who underwent COVID-19 testing in South Korea between 1 January-31 July 2020. We identified all aspirin users prescribed aspirin within two weeks before or after the index date. The primary outcome was positivity for the COVID-19 test, and secondary outcomes included conventional oxygen therapy, intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death. We applied the propensity score matching method to reduce the possible bias originating from the differences in patients' baseline characteristics. Results: Of those eligible, 662 patients were prescribed aspirin. Among them, 136 patients were on aspirin within two weeks before diagnosis and 526 patients were on aspirin after diagnosis. The COVID-19 test positivity rate was not significantly different according to aspirin use. Aspirin use before COVID-19 was related to an increased death rate and aspirin use after COVID-19 was related to a higher risk of the conventional oxygen therapy. Conclusion: Aspirin use was associated with adverse effects in COVID-19 patients. Further studies for mechanisms are needed."
5355,Facts and Myths: Efficacies of Repurposing Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of COVID-19.,"The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The 2019-nCoV first broke out in Wuhan and subsequently spread worldwide owing to its extreme transmission efficiency. The fact that the COVID-19 cases and mortalities are reported globally and the WHO has declared this outbreak as the pandemic, the international health authorities have focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as search for therapies able to counter the disease severity. Due to the lack of known specific, effective and proven therapies as well as the situation of public-health emergency, drug repurposing appears to be the best armour to find a therapeutic solution against 2019-nCoV infection. Repurposing anti-malarial drugs and chloroquine (CQ)/ hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown efficacy to inhibit most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus. These CQ analogues have shown potential efficacy to inhibit 2019-nCoV in vitro that leads to focus several future clinical trials. This review discusses the possible effective roles and mechanisms of CQ analogues for interfering with the 2019-nCoV replication cycle and infection."
5356,The Systemic Immune Response in COVID-19 Is Associated with a Shift to Formyl-Peptide Unresponsive Eosinophils.,"A malfunction of the innate immune response in COVID-19 is associated with eosinopenia, particularly in more severe cases. This study tested the hypothesis that this eosinopenia is COVID-19 specific and is associated with systemic activation of eosinophils. Blood of 15 healthy controls and 75 adult patients with suspected COVID-19 at the ER were included before PCR testing and analyzed by point-of-care automated flow cytometry (CD10, CD11b, CD16, and CD62L) in the absence or presence of a formyl peptide (fNLF). Forty-five SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were grouped based on disease severity. PCR negative patients with proven bacterial (n = 20) or other viral (n = 10) infections were used as disease controls. Eosinophils were identified with the use of the FlowSOM algorithm. Low blood eosinophil numbers (<100 cells/μL; p < 0.005) were found both in patients with COVID-19 and with other infectious diseases, albeit less pronounced. Two discrete eosinophil populations were identified in healthy controls both before and after activation with fNLF based on the expression of CD11b. Before activation, the CD11bbright population consisted of 5.4% (CI95% = 3.8, 13.4) of total eosinophils. After activation, this population of CD11bbright cells comprised nearly half the population (42.21%, CI95% = 35.9, 54.1). Eosinophils in COVID-19 had a similar percentage of CD11bbright cells before activation (7.6%, CI95% = 4.5, 13.6), but were clearly refractory to activation with fNLF as a much lower percentage of cells end up in the CD11bbright fraction after activation (23.7%, CI95% = 18.5, 27.6; p < 0.001). Low eosinophil numbers in COVID-19 are associated with refractoriness in responsiveness to fNLF. This might be caused by migration of fully functional cells to the tissue."
5357,Prevalence of and factors associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in symptomatic patients followed in general practices in Germany between March 2020 and March 2021.,"Aims: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of and the factors associated with the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in symptomatic patients followed in general practices in Germany between March 2020 and March 2021. Methods: Symptomatic patients tested for COVID-19 and followed in one of 962 general practices in Germany from March 2020 to March 2021 were included in this study. Covariates included sex, age, and comorbidities present in at least 3% of the population. The association between these factors and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was analyzed using an adjusted logistic regression model. Results: A total of 301,290 patients tested for COVID-19 were included in this study (54.7% women; mean [SD] age 44.6 [18.5] years). The prevalence of COVID-19 was 13.8% in this sample. Male sex and older age were positively and significantly associated with COVID-19. In terms of comorbidities, the strongest positive associations with COVID-19 were observed for cardiac arrhythmias, depression, and obesity. There was also a negative relationship between the odds of being diagnosed with COVID-19 and several conditions such as chronic sinusitis, asthma, and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Approximately 14% of symptomatic patients tested for COVID-19 were diagnosed with COVID-19 in German general practices from March 2020 to March 2021."
5358,Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in HHT patients: nasopharyngeal versus oropharyngeal swab.,"On March 11, 2020, WHO has defined the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic that still today continues to affect much of the world. Among the reasons for the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is the role of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic carriers. Therefore diagnostic testing is central to contain the global pandemic. Up to now real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based molecular assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens is the current reference standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Based on current knowledge regarding the sensitivity of the molecular test, the highest positive detection rate is from lower respiratory tract specimens; alternatively it is possible to perform a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab. Nasopharyngeal swab is the preferred choice for SARS-CoV-2 testing since it seems to have a greater sensitivity; however the procedure is not always free of complications and an epistaxis can occur. Among patients with greatest risk of massive nosebleed there are HHT patients. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disease that leads to multiregional mucocutanous telangiectases and visceral arteriovenous malformations. Clinically, the presence of telangiectases in nasal mucosa is the cause of recurrent epistaxis. In HHT patients the execution of the nasopharyngeal swab can determine from little or no consequences to a massive epistaxis leading to the necessity of nasal packing generally followed by hospital admission. In HHT patients undergoing a diagnostic test to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 infection status, especially in those patients with frequent epistaxis with a history of anemia and repeated hospitalizations, it is therefore advisable to perform an oropharyngeal swab. This, compared to the nasopharyngeal swab, exposes to a lower risk of severe nosebleeds related treatments, such as blood transfusions or invasive procedures. According to the risk-benefit assessment and based on our experience, we consider that, despite a lower diagnostic sensitivity, oropharyngeal swab is preferable to nasopharyngeal swab for the diagnosis of SARS CoV-2 infection in patients with HHT."
5359,No SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in 25 patients with pseudo-chilblains.,"Chilblain-like acral lesions have been identified in some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. It has been suggested that these pseudo-chilblains could be a specific marker of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Most patients with these lesions have had negative polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), but some authors believe serology tests are likely to give positive results. We designed a prospective study including all patients with pseudo-chilblains treated in outpatient department in April and May 2020 and then performed SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology tests on all available patients. We evaluated 59 patients, of whom 17 had undergone PCR before the study period, all with negative results. For the present study, we performed 20 additional PCRs, serology tests in 25 patients, and a parvovirus B19 antibody test in 15 patients. All results were negative. Our findings counter the hypothesis that serology is likely to reveal SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with pseudo-chilblains. One hypothesis for our negative results is that the time period between symptom onset and antibody production is longer in these patients; another is that the lesions are caused by behavioral changes during lockdown rather than SARS-CoV-2 infection. We nevertheless maintain that COVID-19 should be ruled out in people presenting with chilblain-like lesions."
