2215,Hematological and biochemical parameters as diagnostic and prognostic markers in SARS-COV-2 infected patients of Pakistan: a retrospective comparative analysis.,"Objectives: This study was conducted to investigate alteration in blood parameters and their association with the presence, severity, and mortality of COVID-19 patients as the data on hematological abnormalities associated with the Pakistani COVID-19 patients is limited.Methodology: A double-centered, hospital-based comparative retrospective case study was conducted, to include all the admitted patients (n = 317) having COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive. The control group (n = 157) tested negative for COVID-19.Results: Of 317 admitted cases, the majority were males n = 198 (62.5%). Associated comorbidities, lower lymphocytes, platelets, and higher White blood cells, neutrophil, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were found in COVID-19 cases as compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001 for all). The biochemical parameters of cases including Ferritin, D-Dimer, CRP, IL-6, LDH, ALT, AST, and APTT also showed a statistically significant difference compared with standard values (p < 0.001 for all). However, their comparison with a severity level of the severe and non-severe groups showed significance for WBCs, neutrophils, NLR (p < 0.001 for all), and PLR (p = 0.06) only. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that NLR had the highest area under curve (0.84) followed by 1/lymphocyte (0.82), neutrophils (0.74), PLR (0.67),1/platelets (0.68) and WBC's (0.65). Comparison of cases and controls with recommended cut-off values derived from sensitivity and 1-specificity was also done (p < 0.001).Conclusion: Monitoring all the hematological and biochemical parameters including novel hemograms NLR, PLR can aid clinicians to identify potentially severe cases at early stages and initiate effective management in time which may reduce the overall mortality of COVID-19 patients."

2217,Evaluating the Effect of a Modified Sample Preparation on SARS-CoV-2 Detection in a Cartridge-Based Platform.,"Introduction: The ePlex® SARS-CoV-2 emergency use authorization (EUA) test is a cartridge-based assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. Since performance data has been previously published on this platform, the manufacturer has modified the workflow design in order to improve assay performance. Evaluation of the new workflow, which eliminated the sample delivery device (SDD), led to a dramatic improvement of assay performance while saving time and making cartridge loading more convenient. Methods: 145 confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were used to evaluate the assay analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and overall time-saving for the 2 workflows that is with and without the use of SDD on the ePlex SARS-CoV-2 test. Results: Elimination of the SDD step led to a dramatic increase in accuracy and the overall limit of detection when using 145 previously defined and valid SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens with relatively low, medium, and high cycle thresholds (CT). This simple workflow change led to an overall detection from 94/145 (64.8%) to 131/145 (90.3%), with an additional 37 specimens being detected. CT value ranges revealed that 90% of the specimens in the 33 ≤ CT < 35.3 CT range were detected, whereas with the SDD workflow, only 30% of positive specimens were detected in this same range. Hands-on time for each specimen also improved and showed overall time savings. Conclusion: The simple workflow modification eliminating the SDD led to an overall improvement in the detection of positive specimens and also simplified workflow and reduced hands-on time."
2218,[The COVID-19 breaker : PCR to the rescue !].,"Chronicle of a crisis management at the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of CHU Liège The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in December 2019 in China and its expansion across the world and Europe have requested the participation of clinical laboratories as major players in the diagnosis of COVID-19, to perform PCR tests mainly on nasopharyngeal swabs. In Belgium, the first confirmed COVID-19 patient was diagnosed in early February, the first of many, especially travelers returning from winter sports. In order to meet the ever-increasing demands for testing, the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of the CHU of Liege had to adapt to this situation: firstly, by developing manual PCR tests and then automated solutions, permitting to increase the number of analyzes by ensuring a short turnaround time of results. Then, a system for the communication of results on a large scale has been set up, and finally solutions to deal with the lack of sampling devices have been found. This first wave of the pandemic has also highlighted an unprecedented solidarity within the institution. In this article, we recount the chronology of the management of this unprecedented health crisis within the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of the CHU of Liege."
2219,Forewarned is forearmed: chronic spontaneous urticaria as a potential risk to effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine uptake and global public health.,"Chronic spontaneous urticaria and angioedema (CSU/A) is a common condition with an estimated global point prevalence of 0.7% (95% C.I, 0.2‐1.4)(1), higher in non‐White populations. Symptoms present as an ‘allergy mimic’ but are underpinned by non‐specific, non‐IgE‐mediated mast cell histamine release. The combination of common population prevalence and likelihood of vaccines precipitating symptoms in those with CSU/A presents an immediate risk to the SARS‐COV‐2 global vaccine program."
