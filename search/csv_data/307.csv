3060,"Molecular characterization, pathogen-host interaction pathway and in silico approaches for vaccine design against COVID-19.","COVID-19 has forsaken the world because of extremely high infection rates and high mortality rates. At present we have neither medicine nor vaccine to prevent this pandemic. Lockdowns, curfews, isolations, quarantines, and social distancing are the only ways to mitigate their infection. This is badly affecting the mental health of people. Hence, there is an urgent need to address this issue. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel Betacorona virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) which has emerged in the city of Wuhan in China and declared a pandemic by WHO since it affected almost all the countries the world, infected 24,182,030 people and caused 825,798 death as per data are compiled from John Hopkins University (JHU). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded positive (+) sense RNA of ∼30 kb nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence similarity (∼79 %) with SARS-CoV. Envelope and nucleocapsids are two evolutionary conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 having a sequence identity of about 96 % and 89.6 %, respectively as compared to SARS-CoV. The characterization of SARS-CoV-2 is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Transmission of this virus in the human occurs through the respiratory tract and decreases the respiration efficiency of lungs. Humans are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 with an incubation period of 2-14 days. The virus first infects the lower airway and bind with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of alveolar epithelial cells. Due to the unavailability of drugs or vaccines, it is very urgent to design potential vaccines or drugs for COVID-19. Reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic play an important role in designing potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The suitable vaccine selects for SARS-CoV-2 based on binding energy between the target protein and the designed vaccine. The stability and activity of the designed vaccine can be estimated by using molecular docking and dynamic simulation approaches. This review mainly focused on the brief up to date information about COVID-19, molecular characterization, pathogen-host interaction pathways involved during COVID-19 infection. It also covers potential vaccine design against COVID-19 by using various computational approaches. SARS-CoV-2 enters brain tissue through the different pathway and harm human's brain and causes severe neurological disruption."
3061,"COVID-19 infection among first responders in Broward County, Florida, March-April 2020.","Background: First responders (FRs) may have a significant risk of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) infection than the general population due to job-related exposures. We aimed to determine the prevalence and exposure patterns of COVID-19 among FRs. Methods: Between March and April 2020, FRs in Broward County, Florida, were screened for COVID-19 infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay using nasopharyngeal swabs. Demographics and COVID-19 positive rate of the FRs were summarized. Results: A total of 3375 FRs were screened for COVID-19 infection. The median age of FRs tested was 42 years (IQR 33-52 years), and 1464 (43.4%) were men. A total of 2902 (85.9%) were asymptomatic, and 473 (14.1%) reported symptoms associated with COVID-19. Overall, 289 (8.6%) were positive, with the highest rates among the age between 25 and 49 years. Of those testing positive, 235 (81.3%) were asymptomatic. Fourteen days after their first positive test, 81 (69.8%) of the 116 asymptomatically infected FRs were negative, and 35 (30.2%) remained positive and asymptomatic. Conclusions: The FRs in Broward County, FL, had an overall infection rate of 8.6% at the time of COVID-19 testing, and asymptomatic FRs accounted for 81.3% of infection. Active surveillance should be focused on the asymptomatic FRs with COVID-19."
3062,Association of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms with COVID-19 susceptibility and its outcome.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a global health issue and develops into a broad range of illnesses from asymptomatic to fatal respiratory diseases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with oxidative stress that triggers cytokine production, inflammation, and other pathophysiological processes. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) is an important enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with electrophiles to protect the cell from oxidative damage and participates in the antioxidant defense mechanism in the lungs. Thus, in this study, we investigated the role of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphism with COVID-19 susceptibility, as well as its outcome. The study included 269 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild (n = 149) and severe (n = 120) conditions. All subjects were genotyped for GSTM1 and GSTT1 by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) followed by statistical analysis. The frequency of GSTM1-/- , GSTT1-/- and GSTM1-/- /GSTT1-/- was higher in severe COVID-19 patients as compared to mild patients but we did not observe a significant association. In the Cox hazard model, death was significantly 2.28-fold higher in patients with the GSTT1-/- genotype (p = 0.047). In combination, patients having GSTM1+/+ and GSTT1-/- genotypes showed a poor survival rate (p = 0.02). Our results suggested that COVID-19 patients with the GSTT1-/- genotype showed higher mortality."

It includes data on COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Australia, the international situation and a review of current evidence."

3068,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in solid-organ transplant recipients: What the clinician needs to know.,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed at an unparalleled speed, with 14 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently authorized. Solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at risk for developing a higher rate of COVID-19-related complications and therefore they are at priority for immunization against SARS-CoV-2. Preliminary data suggest that although SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are safe in SOT recipients (with similar rate of adverse events than in the general population), the antibody responses are decreased in this population. Risk factors for poor vaccine immunogenicity include older age, shorter time from transplantation, use of mycophenolate and belatacept, and worse allograft function. SOT recipients should continue to be advised to maintain hand hygiene, use of facemasks, and social distancing after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Vaccination of household contacts should be also prioritized. Although highly encouraged for research purposes, systematic assessment in clinical practice of humoral and cellular immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is controversial, since correlation between immunological findings and clinical protection from severe COVID-19, and cutoffs for protection are currently unknown in SOT recipients. Alternative immunization schemes, including a booster dose, higher doses, and modulation of immunosuppression during vaccination, need to be assessed in the context of well-designed clinical trials."
3069,Transplantation programs facing lack of empirical evidence on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: A society recommendation consensus update.,"Background: Since phase III trials for the most prominent vaccines excluded immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients, data on safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for recipients of solid organ transplantations are scarce. Aims: Our study offers a synthesis of expert opinions aligned with available data addressing key questions of the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations for transplant patients. Method: An online research was performed retrieving available recommendations by national and international transplantation organizations and state institutions on SARS-CoV2 vaccination management for transplant recipients. Results: Eleven key statements were identified from recommendations by 18 national and international societies, and consensus for the individual statements was evaluated by means of the Society Recommendation Consensus score. The highest consensus level (SRC A) was found for prioritized access to vaccination for transplant patients despite anticipation of a weakened immune response. All currently authorized vaccines can be considered safe for transplant patients (SRC A). The handling of immunosuppressive medication, the timely management of vaccines, and other aspects were aligned with available expert opinions. Conclusion: Expert consensus can be determined for crucial aspects of the implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs. We hereby offer a tool for immediate decision-making until empirical data becomes available."
