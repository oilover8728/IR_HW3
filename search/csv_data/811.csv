8101,Unraveling the Modes of Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) During a Nursing Home Outbreak: Looking Beyond the Church Superspreading Event.,"Background: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a nursing home in the Netherlands, following an on-site church service held on 8 March 2020, triggered an investigation to unravel sources and chain(s) of transmission. Methods: Epidemiological data were collected from registries and through a questionnaire among church attendees. Symptomatic residents and healthcare workers (HCWs) were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS). Sequences from a selection of people from the same area were included as community reference. Results: After the church service, 30 of 39 attendees (77%) developed symptoms; 14 (11 residents and 3 nonresidents) were tested and were positive for COVID-19. In the following 5 weeks, 62 of 300 residents (21%) and 30 of 640 HCWs (5%) tested positive for COVID-19; 21 of 62 residents (34%) died. The outbreak was controlled through a cascade of measures. WGS of samples from residents and HCWs identified a diversity of sequence types, grouped into 8 clusters. Seven resident church attendees all were infected with distinct viruses, 4 of which belonged to 2 larger clusters in the nursing home. Conclusions: Although initial investigation suggested the church service as the source of the outbreak, detailed analysis showed a more complex picture, most consistent with widespread regional circulation of the virus in the weeks before the outbreak, and multiple introductions into the nursing home before the visitor ban. The findings underscore the importance of careful outbreak investigations to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission to develop evidence-based mitigation measures."
8102,Preoperative computerized tomography screening for COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients: experiences from two centers.,"Purpose: The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the preoperative screening performance of chest CT (computerized tomography) examination to detect COVID-19 positive individuals. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study 218 adult patients who had preoperative chest CT and RT-PCR were enrolled. CT imaging results, which have been reported according to the Radiological Society of North America expert consensus on COVID-19, were collected from the picture archiving and communicating system. Demographic data, planned surgeries, and postoperative outcomes were collected from the electronic patient records. Results: One patient (0.5%) showed typical CT features for COVID-19 pneumonia; 12 patients (5.5%) were reported as indeterminate, and eight (3.7%) were reported as atypical for COVID-19 pneumonia. Only one of the three patients with positive RT-PCR had abnormalities on CT. When RT-PCR tests were taken as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of chest CT in showing COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic patients were 33.3%, 90.7%, and 90.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Chest CT screening for COVID-19 has a very low yield in asymptomatic preoperative patients and shows false-positive findings in 9.2% of cases, potentially leading to unnecessary postponing of the surgery."
8103,"Introduction of ORF3a-Q57H SARS-CoV-2 Variant Causing Fourth Epidemic Wave of COVID-19, Hong Kong, China.","We describe an introduction of clade GH severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causing a fourth wave of coronavirus disease in Hong Kong. The virus has an ORF3a-Q57H mutation, causing truncation of ORF3b. This virus evades induction of cytokine, chemokine, and interferon-stimulated gene expression in primary human respiratory cells."
8104,Adjunctive treatment with high-titre convalescent plasma in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients - a safe but futile intervention. A comparative cohort study.,"Background: Convalescent plasma (CP) containing antibodies derived from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors has been proposed as a promising therapeutic option for severe COVID-19. Methods: In our intensive care unit (ICU), 55 patients (46 male, median age 61 years) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (35 = 63.6% on mechanical ventilation, 7 = 14.5% on high-flow nasal oxygen, 12 = 20% on non-invasive ventilation, 1 = 1.8% without respiratory support) were treated with high-titre CP (200 mL per dose, range 1-6 doses, median 3 doses per patient, minimum titre > 1:100, Wantai test). 139 COVID-19 patients treated in the same ICU who did not receive CP served as control group. In 27 patients, the effect of CP on the individual levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was assessed by ELISA in serum sample pairs collected before and after CP transfusion. Results: The first CP dose was administered at a median of 8 days after symptom onset. 13 patients in the plasma cohort died (28-day mortality 24.1%), compared to 42 (30.2%) in the cohort who did not receive CP (p = 0.5, Pearson Chi-squared test). Out of the 27 individuals investigated for the presence of IgG antibodies, 8 did not have detectable IgG levels before the first CP transfusion. In this subpopulation, 3 patients (37.5%) died. Not a single confirmed adverse reaction to CP was noted. Conclusions: While adjunctive treatment with CP for severe and life-threatening COVID-19 was a very safe intervention, we did not observe any effect on mortality."
8105,Advances in the possible treatment of COVID-19: A review.,"The emergence of the global pandemic caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has put a challenge to identify or derive the therapeutics for its prevention and treatment. Despite the unprecedented advances in the modern medicinal system, currently, there are no proven effective therapies. However, rapid research on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology help unveiling some new targets for potential drug therapies. Many drugs have been screened, and even their clinical trials are going on at an exceptional pace. Amongst these RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (favipiravir and remdesivir) and steroids especially dexamethasone showed promising effects. The biological agents like tocilizumab, interferons, and convalescent plasma prove to be beneficial in viral clearance. Moreover, many immunomodulatory and viral S protein targeting vaccines have their ongoing clinical trials. The establishment of various in vitro and in vivo models for preclinical studies can additionally help the current research. The volume and the pace of the clinical trials launched to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reflect the need for high-quality evidence for various therapies to be practiced by clinicians. This study aims to sum up all the current advances in the global medicinal system against the COVID-19."
8106,A consideration of convalescent plasma and plasma derivatives in the care of Severely-ill patients with COVID-19.,"The pathogenesis and immunopathological damage of severe forms of COVID-19 resemble acute autoimmune disease sparked by SARS-CoV-2, including an early systemic overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. Such immunopathological features provide a rationale for the use of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma as a source of neutralizing anti-viral antibodies and of anti-inflammatory plasma components. While convalescent plasma therapy is now being evaluated in prospective clinical trials, we further consider the therapeutic potential of human hyper immune globulins, and of heterologous, engineered and monoclonal neutralizing antibodies as anti-viral agents to treat COVID-19. Good medical practice procedures are still needed and is why we also discuss the potential use of polyclonal polyspecific immunoglobulins (IVIG), a therapeutic plasma derivative, with potent anti-inflammatory activity, in severe forms of Covid-19."
8107,Challenges and opportunities for antiviral monoclonal antibodies as COVID-19 therapy.,"To address the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented global effort to advance potent neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 as therapeutics. However, historical efforts to advance antiviral monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the treatment of other respiratory infections have been met with categorical failures in the clinic. By investigating the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses spread within the lung, along with available biodistribution data for systemically injected mAb, we highlight the challenges faced by current antiviral mAbs for COVID-19. We summarize some of the leading mAbs currently in development, and present the evidence supporting inhaled delivery of antiviral mAb as an early intervention against COVID-19 that could prevent important pulmonary morbidities associated with the infection."

8109,The biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein: multiple targets for host-directed antiviral therapy.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19), represents a far more serious threat to public health than SARS and MERS coronaviruses, due to its ability to spread more efficiently than its predecessors. Currently, there is no worldwide-approved effective treatment for COVID-19, urging the scientific community to intense efforts to accelerate the discovery and development of prophylactic and therapeutic solutions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, effective antiviral drugs are urgently needed. With few exceptions, therapeutic approaches to combat viral infections have traditionally focused on targeting unique viral components or enzymes; however, it has now become evident that this strategy often fails due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Targeting host factors that are essential for the virus life cycle, but are dispensable for the host, has recently received increasing attention. The spike glycoprotein, a component of the viral envelope that decorates the virion surface as a distinctive crown (""corona"") and is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, represents a key target for developing therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion. This review highlights aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike biogenesis that may be amenable to host-directed antiviral targeting."
