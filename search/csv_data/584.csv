5832,Novel approaches for vaccine development.,"Vaccines are critical tools for maintaining global health. Traditional vaccine technologies have been used across a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens, yet there are a number of examples where they have not been successful, such as for persistent infections, rapidly evolving pathogens with high sequence variability, complex viral antigens, and emerging pathogens. Novel technologies such as nucleic acid and viral vector vaccines offer the potential to revolutionize vaccine development as they are well-suited to address existing technology limitations. In this review, we discuss the current state of RNA vaccines, recombinant adenovirus vector-based vaccines, and advances from biomaterials and engineering that address these important public health challenges."
5833,"Update and Supplementary Articles Proteins of SARS CoV-2, Which Causes COVID-19, and the Interacting Proteins.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is the pandemic caused by the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2), first appearing in December 2019, continues to confound the world. In this update we provide insights into how some of the new mutant variant strains of SARS CoV-2 have evolved to be more infective. We also introduce our supplement of the special issue on the topic of the proteins of SARS CoV-2 in the Protein Journal, which follows this introduction."

5835,Comparison of computed tomography (CT) findings with RT-PCR in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children.,"Aim: This study aimed to compare chest computed tomography (CT) findings with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results in children with probable or definitive diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: In this retrospective archive study, pediatric patients who were followed up in the hospital with a possible or definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 and who had chest CT at presentation were included. CT scan images of the patients were reinterpreted by a pediatric radiologist and compared with their RT-PCR test results. Results: Of the total of 89 patients, 33 had negative and 56 had positive RT-PCR tests. The presence of pulmonary lesions and consolidation was statistically significantly higher in the RT-PCR negative group than in the RT-PCR positive group (p = 0.037 and 0.001, respectively). Lobe involvement of 0%-25% was higher in the RT-PCR positive group (p = 0.001), and lobe involvements of 25%-50% and 50%-75% were significantly higher in the RT-PCR negative group (p = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively). Central and perihilar involvement was found to be statistically significant in the RT-PCR negative group (p = 0.008 and 0.005, respectively). Conclusion: Chest CT findings may provide some clues in predicting RT-PCR positivity in children with a probable diagnosis of COVID-19. Lobe involvement percentage of up to 25% is a finding in favor of patients with positive RT-PCR test, whereas 25%-75% lobe involvement, central and perihilar involvement, and consolidation can be interpreted in favor of patients with negative RT-PCR test."

5837,COVID-19 vaccines.,"COVID-19 is a pandemic of unprecedented proportions in recent human history. Less than 18 months since the onset of the pandemic, there are close to two hundred million confirmed cases and four million deaths worldwide. There have also been massive efforts geared towards finding safe and effective vaccines. By July 2021 there were 184 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in pre-clinical development, 105 in clinical development, and 18 vaccines approved for emergency use by at least one regulatory authority. These vaccines include whole virus live attenuated or inactivated, protein-based, viral vector, and nucleic acid vaccines. By mid-2021 three billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered around the world, mostly in high-income countries. COVID-19 vaccination provides hope for an end to the pandemic, if and only if there would be equal access and optimal uptake in all countries around the world."
5838,COVID-19 vaccine delay: An examination of United States residents' intention to delay vaccine uptake.,"The current study examines differences between COVID-19 vaccine intention and delay. A survey was administered to 585 US respondents in late November 2020 as part of an online longitudinal study. Respondents provided information on whether they would obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available, and how long they intended to wait before obtaining it. In the negative intention group, 3.4% reported waiting a few weeks, 34.0% waiting a few months, and 62.6% never getting vaccinated. In multivariable models, social norms were a significant and independent predictor of all vaccine delay and intention models. Vaccine delay was associated with low levels of worry about becoming infected with COVID-19, political conservatism, concerns about vaccine side effects, and low levels of believing a vaccine would be effective. Negative vaccine intentions were associated with worries about becoming infected with COVID-19, concerns about vaccine side effects, beliefs that the vaccines were developed too quickly, and low endorsement of the altruistic belief that older people should have vaccination priority. The study results highlight the importance of a multifactorial approach to assessing vaccine attitudes. The findings suggest that uptake programs should focus on enhancing pro-vaccine norms."
5839,Negative viral nucleic acid test of induced sputum: an additional criteria for COVID-19 patient's discharge.,"Objective: Concerns have been raised that patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still infectious with a re-positive nucleic acid test of the pharyngeal swab after hospital discharge. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of induced sputum as an additional indicator for the current clinical discharge criteria of COVID-19 patients to prevent virus recurrence. Patients and methods: Twenty-one COVID-19 patients who met the national clinical discharge criteria were discharged from the hospital and tested daily for the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid in their pharyngeal swabs and every other day for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in their induced sputum. Once the patient's induced sputum was negative after two consecutive tests, testing was discontinued. Results: Among 21 discharged patients from COVID-19, the first pharyngeal swab and induced sputum tests for viral nucleic acid were positive in 3 (14.3%) and 8 (38.1%) patients respectively. Induced sputum was significantly more positive than pharyngeal swab (p < 0.05). In our cohort, all pharyngeal swabs became negative at day 7, and all induced sputa turned negative at day 11 after discharge. Interestingly, patients with negative pharyngeal swabs experienced viral relapse, whereas patients with negative induced sputum did not revert to positivity. Conclusions: The detection rate of positive viral nucleic acid in induced sputum was high. Patients with negative induced sputum nucleic acid tests did not have a relapse of SARS-COV-2, indicating that viral nucleic acid testing of induced sputum should be used as an additional criterion for patients with national clinical discharge criteria COVID-19."
