7900,"The kidney, COVID-19, and the chemokine network: an intriguing trio.","On December 30th 2019, some patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), a program run by the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID), hypothesized to be related to subjects who had had contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, China. Chinese authorities instituted an emergency agency aimed at identifying the source of infection and potential biological pathogens. It was subsequently named by the World Committee on Virus Classification as 2019-nCoV (2019-novel coronavirus) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A number of studies have demonstrated that 2019-nCoV and the SARS-CoV shared the same cell entry receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This is expressed in human tissues, not only in the respiratory epithelia, but also in the small intestines, heart, liver, and kidneys. Here, we examine the most recent findings on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on kidney diseases, mainly acute kidney injury, and the potential role of the chemokine network."

7903,Self-Collected Anterior Nasal and Saliva Specimens versus Health Care Worker-Collected Nasopharyngeal Swabs for the Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"We prospectively compared health care worker-collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) to self-collected anterior nasal swabs (ANS) and straight saliva for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 354 patients. The percent positive agreement between NPS and ANS or saliva was 86.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76.7 to 92.9%) and 93.8% (95% CI, 86.0 to 97.9%), respectively. The percent negative agreement was 99.6% (95% CI, 98.0 to 100.0%) for NPS versus ANS and 97.8% (95% CI, 95.3 to 99.2%) for NPS versus saliva. More cases were detected by the use of NPS (n = 80) and saliva (n = 81) than by the use of ANS (n = 70), but no single specimen type detected all severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections."
7904,High-throughput detection of antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in longitudinal convalescent plasma samples.,"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing more than two million deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and represent the main target for antibody responses. Humoral responses were shown to be important for preventing and controlling infection by coronaviruses. A promising approach to reduce the severity of COVID-19 is the transfusion of convalescent plasma. However, longitudinal studies revealed that the level of antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines rapidly after the resolution of the infection. Study design and methods: To extend this observation beyond the RBD domain, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the plasma from 15 convalescent donors. We generated a 293T cell line constitutively expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and used it to develop a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies in the plasma of convalescent donors. Results and conclusion: We found that the level of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines gradually after the resolution of the infection. This decline was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the decline of RBD-specific antibodies and the number of days post-symptom onset. These findings help to better understand the decline of humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provide important information on when to collect plasma after recovery from active infection for convalescent plasma transfusion."
7905,Dengue-COVID-19 coinfection: the first reported case in the Philippines.,"The rainy season in the Philippines is from June to October; this is when the number of dengue cases typically increases. In 2020 during this time, the world was facing the threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and dengue viral infections have similar presentations and laboratory findings, including fever and thrombocytopenia, and there have been reports of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and arthropod-borne virus. Here, we report a case of SARS-CoV-2-dengue virus coinfection in the Philippines in a female aged 62 years, whose early symptom was fever and who was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and positive for dengue. Early recognition of such coinfection is important so that proper measures can be taken in the management of the patient."
7906,"Genetic structure of SARS-CoV-2 reflects clonal superspreading and multiple independent introduction events, North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany, February and March 2020.","We whole-genome sequenced 55 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Germany to investigate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in 2020 in the Heinsberg district and Düsseldorf. While the genetic structure of the Heinsberg outbreak indicates a clonal origin, reflecting superspreading dynamics from mid-February during the carnival season, distinct viral strains were circulating in Düsseldorf in March, reflecting the city's international links. Limited detection of Heinsberg strains in the Düsseldorf area despite geographical proximity may reflect efficient containment and contact-tracing efforts."
7907,Consensus Recommendations for Intramuscular COVID-19 Vaccination in Patients with Hemophilia.,"Background: Currently available coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are approved for intramuscular injection and efficacy may not be ensured when given subcutaneously. For years, subcutaneous vaccination was recommended in patients with hemophilia to avoid intramuscular bleeds. Therefore, recommendations for the application of COVID-19 vaccines are needed. Methods: The Delphi methodology was used to develop consensus recommendations. An initial list of recommendations was prepared by a steering committee and evaluated by 39 hemophilia experts. Consensus was defined as ≥75% agreement and strong consensus as ≥95% agreement, and agreement as a score ≥7 on a scale of 1 to 9. After four rounds, a final list of statements was compiled. Recommendations: Consensus was achieved that COVID-19 vaccines licensed only for intramuscular injection should be administered intramuscularly in hemophilia patients. Prophylactic factor replacement, given on the day of vaccination with a maximum interval between prophylaxis and vaccination of 24 hours (factor VIII and conventional factor IX concentrates) or 48 hours (half-life extended factor IX), should be provided in patients with moderate or severe hemophilia. Strong consensus was achieved that patients with mild hemophilia and residual factor activity greater than 10% with mild bleeding phenotype or patients on emicizumab usually do not need factor replacement before vaccination. Swelling, erythema, and hyperthermia after vaccination are not always signs of bleeding but should prompt consultation of a hemophilia care center. In case of injection-site hematoma, patients should receive replacement therapy until symptoms disappear. Conclusions: Consensus was achieved on recommendations for intramuscular COVID-19 vaccination after replacement therapy for hemophilia patients depending on disease severity."
7908,[Convalescent plasma as a therapy for severe COVID-19 pneumonia].,"The COVID-19 pandemic presented high mortality from its beginning, without effective treatment for seriously ill patients. Build on the experience in Argentine hemorrhagic fever with convalescent plasma, we incorporated 90 patients with COVID-19, of which 87 were evaluable, into a multicenter study. We collected 397 plasma donations from 278 convalescent donors. Patients received plasma with an IgG concentration of 0.7-0.8 (measured by Abbott chemiluminescence) for every 10 kg of body weight. Survival during the first 28 days was the primary objective; 77% were male, age 54 ± 15.6 y/o (range 27-85), body mass index 29.7 ± 4.4; hypertension 39% and diabetes 20.7%; 19.5% had an immunosuppressive condition, 23% were health workers. Plasma was administered to 55 (63%) on spontaneous breathing with oxygen supplementation (mainly oxygen mask with reservoir bag in 80%), and to 32 patients (37%) on mechanical ventilation. The 28-day survival rate was 80%; 91% in patients infused on spontaneous breathing and 63% in those on mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0002). There was a significant improvement in the WHO pneumonia clinical scale at 7 and 14 days, and in PaO2 / FiO2, ferritin and LDH, in the week post-infusion. We observed an episode of circulatory volume overload and a febrile reaction, both mild. Convalescent plasma infusions are feasible, safe, and potentially effective, especially before requiring mechanical ventilation. They are an attractive clinical option for treating severe forms of COVID-19 until other effective therapies become available."
7909,A SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) biological network to find targets for drug repurposing.,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus needs a fast recognition of effective drugs to save lives. In the COVID-19 situation, finding targets for drug repurposing can be an effective way to present new fast treatments. We have designed a two-step solution to address this approach. In the first step, we identify essential proteins from virus targets or their associated modules in human cells as possible drug target candidates. For this purpose, we apply two different algorithms to detect some candidate sets of proteins with a minimum size that drive a significant disruption in the COVID-19 related biological networks. We evaluate the resulted candidate proteins sets with three groups of drugs namely Covid-Drug, Clinical-Drug, and All-Drug. The obtained candidate proteins sets approve 16 drugs out of 18 in the Covid-Drug, 273 drugs out of 328 in the Clinical-Drug, and a large number of drugs in the All-Drug. In the second step, we study COVID-19 associated proteins sets and recognize proteins that are essential to disease pathology. This analysis is performed using DAVID to show and compare essential proteins that are contributed between the COVID-19 comorbidities. Our results for shared proteins show significant enrichment for cardiovascular-related, hypertension, diabetes type 2, kidney-related and lung-related diseases."
