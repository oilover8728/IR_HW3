2740,"The Relationship between Serological Testing, Demographics, Clinical Presentation and RT-PCR Testing for COVID-19.","Background: Serological tests provide an important tool to diagnose previous exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein we describe the relationship between the demographics, clinical characteristics, and molecular investigations and the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibodies. Methods: Three hundred and four participants, living in Gauteng, South Africa, were screened for COVID-19 antibodies between September 12, and December 12, 2020. Indications for serological testing included previous infection (n = 45, 14.80%), World Health Organization (WHO) symptoms (n = 122, 40.13%), positive household contact (n = 40, 13.16%), and/or positive close non-household contact (n = 80, 26.32%). Results: There were 58 (19.08%) positive rapid antibody tests. Risk factors associated with a positive rapid antibody test included WHO symptoms, namely fever/chills (odds ratio [OR] 3.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50 to 8.19), loss of taste or smell (OR 8.66, 95% CI 3.27 to 22.94), and the presence of a household contact (OR 3.66, 95% CI 1.59 to 8.40). Conclusions: The findings support the measures implemented to reduce the spread of infection."

2743,Delayed neutralizing antibody response in the acute phase correlates with severe progression of COVID-19.,"Adaptive immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dynamics remain largely unknown. The neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are helpful for understanding the pathology. Using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, serum sample neutralization values in symptomatic COVID-19 patients were measured using the chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT). At least two sequential serum samples collected during hospitalization were analyzed to assess NAbs neutralizing activity dynamics at different time points. Of the 11 patients, four (36.4%), six (54.5%), and one (9.1%) had moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Fifty percent neutralization (N50%-CRNT) was observed upon admission in 90.9% (10/11); all patients acquired neutralizing activity 2-12 days after onset. In patients with moderate disease, neutralization was observed at earliest within two days after symptom onset. In patients with severe-to-critical disease, neutralization activity increased, plateauing 9-16 days after onset. Neutralization activity on admission was significantly higher in patients with moderate disease than in patients with severe-to-critical disease (relative % of infectivity, 6.4% vs. 41.1%; P = .011). Neutralization activity on admission inversely correlated with disease severity. The rapid NAb response may play a crucial role in preventing the progression of COVID-19."
2744,Assessment of Real-Time RT-PCR Kits for SARS-CoV-2 Detection.,"The coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 is currently spreading rapidly worldwide. We recently reported a laboratory protocol for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 based on real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays using two primer sets, N and N2. On January 30-31, 2020, the protocol and the reagents for these assays were distributed to the local public health institutes and quarantine depots in Japan nationwide, and thereafter SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was initiated. For further validation, the assays were compared with the commercially available kits using the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and clinical specimens obtained from COVID19-suspected individuals. The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LM S&W-E) assay was highly sensitive for the SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, as both the assays showed consistent results for the clinical specimens. While the LM S&W-E set targets the highly conserved region of E gene in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target specifically the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. Therefore, the N2 set exhibits high specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection. These results indicate that the protocol using the N and N2 sets is comparable to the commercially available kits, and thus is reliable for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19."
2745,Development and implementation of a RT-qPCR extraction-free protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and impact on the turn-around-time.,"The occurrence of the COVID-19 second-wave outbreak in Europe has pushed laboratories performing molecular SARS-CoV-2 tests to increase their throughput and decrease the result rendering time. In this evaluation, we tested for the first time a new, extraction-free, protocol with the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 Assay RT-qPCR kit on a Nimbus platform. Ninety-one samples, of which 71 previously tested positive with RT-qPCR with extraction were immediately analyzed without extraction, using only a dilution and thermal shock protocol. The positive and negative percentage agreements were respectively 97.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-0.99) and 95.0% (95% CI: 0.76-0.99). The two false negatives observed were very weakly positive with the comparison method. Moderate variations in Ct of the targeted genes were observed (median ± 95% CI): E gene, +2.49 ± 0.44; N gene, +0.98 ± 0.54; RdRP/S genes, +2.64 ± 0.48. On the other hand, the number of tests performed within 24 h raised from 86.4% to 97.8%, the turn-around time decreased from 19:18 to 09:03 (p < .0001), and the number of tests that can be performed per day doubled since this technique was introduced routinely in our laboratory."
