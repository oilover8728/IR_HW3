4271,Factors Associated with a Positive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Testing in Suspected Cases Presenting with Pneumonia: A Retrospective Cohort Study in a Single Medical Center.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global emerging infectious disease. Objectives: To analyze the initial clinical characteristics of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients on admission in order to find out which kinds may be more likely to get positive nucleic acid testing results, and to explore the risk factors associated with all-cause death. Methods: Medical records from 309 highly suspected cases with pneumonia were collected from February 13, 2020, to March 14, 2020, in a COVID-19-designated hospital of Wuhan. The majority of the clinical data were collected on the first day of hospital admission. Results: Of 309 patients with median age 64 years (interquartile ranges [IQR], 53-72 years), 111 patients (35.9%) were confirmed by nucleic acid testing (median age 64 years, IQR: 56-71 years; 48 males). Of those 111 patients, 13 (11.7%) patients died. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with positive testing included fatigue (odds ratios [OR] = 3.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.88-5.24, p < 0.001), cough (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32-0.95, p = 0.032), no less than 1 comorbidity (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.06-2.98, p = 0.030), and severe pneumonia (OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.20-5.97, p = 0.016). Furthermore, age, dyspnea, noneffective antibiotic treatment, white blood cell, lymphocyte, platelets, and organ dysfunction (e.g., higher lactate dehydrogenase) were significantly associated with all-cause in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Patients with severe forms of this disease were more likely to get positive results. Age and organ dysfunction were associated with a greater risk of death."

4275,COVID-19 Pandemic as an Excellent Opportunity for Global Health Diplomacy.,"Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic is not the first and most frightening global pandemic, and it may not be the last. At the very least, this phenomenon has though seriously challenged the health systems of the world; it has created a new perspective on the value of national, regional, and international cooperation during crises. The post-coronavirus world could be a world of intensified nationalist rivalries on the economic revival and political influence. However, strengthening cooperation among nations at different levels will lead to the growth of health, economy, and security. The current situation is a touchstone for international actors in coordinating the efforts in similar future crises. At present, this pandemic crisis cannot be resolved except through joint international cooperation, global cohesion, and multilateralism. This perspective concludes that the pandemic could be an excellent opportunity for the scope of global health diplomacy (GHD) and how it can be applied and practiced for strengthening five global arenas, namely (1) International Cooperation and Global Solidarity, (2) Global Economy, Trade and Development, (3) Global Health Security, (4) Strengthening health systems, and (5) Addressing inequities to achieve the global health targets. GHD proves to be very useful for negotiating better policies, stronger partnerships, and achieving international cooperation in this phase with many geopolitical shifts and nationalist mindset among many nations at this stage of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out."
4276,Scalable live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate demonstrates preclinical safety and efficacy.,"Successfully combating the COVID-19 pandemic depends on mass vaccination with suitable vaccines to achieve herd immunity. Here, we describe COVI-VAC, the only live attenuated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine currently in clinical development. COVI-VAC was developed by recoding a segment of the viral spike protein with synonymous suboptimal codon pairs (codon-pair deoptimization), thereby introducing 283 silent (point) mutations. In addition, the furin cleavage site within the spike protein was deleted from the viral genome for added safety of the vaccine strain. Except for the furin cleavage site deletion, the COVI-VAC and parental SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequences are identical, ensuring that all viral proteins can engage with the host immune system of vaccine recipients. COVI-VAC was temperature sensitive in vitro yet grew robustly (>107 plaque forming units/mL) at the permissive temperature. Tissue viral loads were consistently lower, lung pathology milder, and weight loss reduced in Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) vaccinated intranasally with COVI-VAC compared to those inoculated with wild-type (WT) virus. COVI-VAC inoculation generated spike IgG antibody levels and plaque reduction neutralization titers similar to those in hamsters inoculated with WT virus. Upon challenge with WT virus, COVI-VAC vaccination reduced lung challenge viral titers, resulted in undetectable virus in the brain, and protected hamsters from almost all SARS-CoV-2-associated weight loss. Highly attenuated COVI-VAC is protective at a single intranasal dose in a relevant in vivo model. This, coupled with its large-scale manufacturing potential, supports its potential use in mass vaccination programs."
4277,First case of postmortem study in a patient vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.,"A previously symptomless 86-year-old man received the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. He died 4 weeks later from acute renal and respiratory failure. Although he did not present with any COVID-19-specific symptoms, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before he died. Spike protein (S1) antigen-binding showed significant levels for immunoglobulin (Ig) G, while nucleocapsid IgG/IgM was not elicited. Acute bronchopneumonia and tubular failure were assigned as the cause of death at autopsy; however, we did not observe any characteristic morphological features of COVID-19. Postmortem molecular mapping by real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed relevant SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold values in all organs examined (oropharynx, olfactory mucosa, trachea, lungs, heart, kidney and cerebrum) except for the liver and olfactory bulb. These results might suggest that the first vaccination induces immunogenicity but not sterile immunity."
4278,[Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 PCR Positive Cases in the Pediatric Emergency Department].,"In December 2019, a previously unknown type of coronavirus was detected in China and named as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)"". The World Health Organization has named the SARS-CoV-2 related as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and declared it as a pandemic. There is a limited data about the COVID-19 disease for the pediatric patients. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment and clinical outcomes of patients admitted to the pediatric emergency department with the suspicion of COVID-19. Between March 11 and June 16, 2020, patients aged between 1 month-18 years admitted to the pediatric emergency department and who have an indication for sampling for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method with the suspicion of COVID-19 according to the current guidelines published by the Ministry of Health were included in the study. The demographic characteristics, symptoms, durations and the history of contact with the suspected/definite COVID-19 cases were questioned in the patients with positive results. Physical examination, laboratory and imaging data of the patients were recorded. According to clinical severity, patients were divided into five groups. Treatment methods, ward/intensive care unit admission, length of stay at hospital, and prognosis were recorded. Of the 237 patients included in the study, 45 (18.9%) of the samples were positive and 192 (81.1%) were negative. There was a history of contact with COVID-19 positive case in 38 (85.6%) of COVID-19 PCR positive patients. The mean time for onset of symptoms after contact was 3.5 Â± 1.7 days. Twenty-one of the patients (46.6%) were asymptomatic and the most common symptom was fever (34.1%) and cough (27.3%). Of the patients whose laboratory tests were requested, lymphopenia wasdetected in 50% and 52.3% of procalcitonin, 23.5% of C-reactive protein and 64.7% of D-dimer values were found to be high. Chest radiography was obtained from 45.4% of the patients; 90.0% were evaluated as normal, bronchovascular change, pleural effusion and consolidation were detected in one of each (5.0%) patient. Thorax computed tomography (CT) was obtained from 4 (9.0%) patients. One patient had normal CT findings, two patients had consolidation, one patient had peripheral ground-glass appearance and one patient had pleural effusion. Antibiotics were started in 38.6% of the patients and the most commonly used antibiotic was azithromycin (34.1%). Oseltamivir was started in one (2.3%) patient, and 10 (24.7%) patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. There were no serious and critical cases according to the clinical severity. Pediatric patients constitute a small part of COVID-19 individuals in the community, and a significant part of them are asymptomatic, and patients who are symptomatic present with a mild clinic. In our study, most of the patients had a history of contact with COVID-19 positive cases, therefore, it should be questioned when evaluating a pediatric patient. There were no specific findings for COVID-19 positive patients in terms of laboratory and radiology."
4279,Pharmacists' response during a pandemic: A survey on readiness to test during COVID-19.,"Background: Testing is a principle component to reopening society and bringing the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to an end. Pharmacists have the ability to perform certain point-of-care tests under federal regulations. On April 8, 2020, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health issued new guidance authorizing licensed pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 tests. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the views of pharmacists about pharmacist-ordered and -administered COVID-19 testing. Methods: A 13-item questionnaire was developed to survey pharmacists who currently hold an active license in Rhode Island. Results: A total of 122 (13.8%) pharmacists consented and responded to at least 1 question of the survey. The results indicated that the primary concern of the pharmacists in regard to performing COVID-19 testing was spreading the infection to family members (71.3%). Becoming personally infected (59.8%) and not having access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (62.3%) were the second and third most common concerns of the pharmacists. Almost all of the pharmacists (99.9%) responded that they would be willing to take part in the testing process if they had appropriate PPE. A total of 46% of the pharmacists expressed concern regarding reimbursement for their company, whereas 56% of the pharmacists requested personal compensation for this service. Conclusion: Expanding the pool of health care providers who can perform testing is critical to achieving and sustaining proposed testing thresholds. Rhode Island pharmacists are willing to take part in performing COVID-19 testing provided appropriate PPE is available and services are reimbursed. Pharmacists are the most accessible and essential health care providers willing to take on critically important roles during the COVID-19 pandemic provided appropriate safety measures can be met."
