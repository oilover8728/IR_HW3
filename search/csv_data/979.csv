9780,Genomic recombination events may reveal the evolution of coronavirus and the origin of SARS-CoV-2.,"To trace the evolution of coronaviruses and reveal the possible origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we collected and thoroughly analyzed 29,452 publicly available coronavirus genomes, including 26,312 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. We observed coronavirus recombination events among different hosts including 3 independent recombination events with statistical significance between some isolates from humans, bats and pangolins. Consistent with previous records, we also detected putative recombination between strains similar or related to Bat-CoV-RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV-2019. The putative recombination region is located inside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein (S protein), which may represent the origin of SARS-CoV-2. Population genetic analyses provide estimates suggesting that the putative introduced DNA within the RBD is undergoing directional evolution. This may result in the adaptation of the virus to hosts. Unsurprisingly, we found that the putative recombination region in S protein was highly diverse among strains from bats. Bats harbor numerous coronavirus subclades that frequently participate in recombination events with human coronavirus. Therefore, bats may provide a pool of genetic diversity for the origin of SARS-CoV-2."
9781,[2019-nCoV: new challenges from coronavirus].,"The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to China's public health and clinical treatment. The virus belongs to the β genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research."
9782,[Can SARS-CoV-2 infect the eye?-An overview of the receptor status in ocular tissue].,"Is the new coronavirus SARS-CoV‑2 able to infect ocular tissue and thus poses a risk of infection through the tissue in addition to the risk of contact? This is the question that has occupied ophthalmologists since the beginning of the outbreak. In order to infect a certain type of tissue specific receptors for each virus and sometimes also coreceptors or other proteins must be present. The aim of this review was to summarize and reflect the current state of research with the help of the currently available literature as of 28 May 2020. At the time of the research, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was clearly identified as the receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as the necessary protease to enable the infection of human cells with SARS-CoV‑2. In the eye both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed, although sometimes very weakly and with varying degrees in different tissues. It is noteworthy that very different results were obtained with different methods. Several reasons can account for this effect: Firstly, the method of detection or preservation of the tissue, secondly, the possibly different expression of the tested tissue samples and thirdly, a possibly rapid loss of receptor expression post-mortem. Therefore, an infection of the eye seems possible, which has already been reported in various publications. The amount of virus or receptor expression necessary to cause an infection is not known. According to current state of knowledge the eye is not considered to be a high-risk tissue due to the low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. Nevertheless, appropriate protective measures are necessary for both medical personnel and patients. In cases of corneal transplantation an infection of the donor tissue with SARS-CoV‑2 must be excluded."
9783,Cabin crew health and fitness-to-fly: Opportunities for re-evaluation amid COVID-19.,"Aircrew fitness-to-fly is among the elements that make aviation the safest form of long-distance transport. The health of cabin crew is a crucial determinant in carrying out safety-related duties. 'Fitness-to-fly' is associated with defined workplace conditions, for which airlines have a legal duty to ensure fitness for employment. We explored the literature on fitness-to-fly to obtain a pragmatic assessment of the challenges for aeromedical examinations. Regulations promulgated by aviation regulatory authorities and airline-internal policies have similar status and meaning, yet there is no harmonised approach internationally, and an inability to conform periodic medical assessments to actual operational fitness. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to better understand fitness-to-fly criteria. Fitness-to-fly measures are mainly based on self-reported data and there is a need for a 'safety' factor for self-reports. Aeromedical evaluations should evolve from meeting medical standards to include pandemics as an element of the overall risk of aircraft operations. Re-evaluating criteria for fitness-to-fly assessment will further the goal of linking research to the actual needs of public health decisionmakers. If airlines are to resume operations at pre-pandemic levels, they must demonstrate to the public and public health agencies that fitness-to-fly assessment is appropriate and effective."
9784,"SARS-CoV-2 serology: Test, test, test, but interpret with caution!","SARS-CoV-2 serological tests are a subject of intense interest and have the potential to significantly enhance the diagnostic capability of healthcare services in the current pandemic. However, as with all novel assays, significant validation is required to understand the clinical relevance of results. We present the first study to assess clinician interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serology scenarios. We identify common key assumptions regarding patient infectivity and protection that are not currently supported by the SARS-CoV-2 evidence base. In this rapidly developing field, we therefore strongly recommend serological assay results are accompanied by clear interpretive support from laboratory and infectious diseases specialists."
9785,SARS-CoV-2 serology and virology trends in donors and recipients of convalescent plasma.,"SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions worldwide. The virus is novel, and currently there is no approved treatment. Convalescent plasma may offer a treatment option. We evaluated trends of IgM/IgG antibodies/plasma viral load in donors and recipients of convalescent plasma. 114/139 (82 %) donors had positive IgG antibodies. 46/114 donors tested positive a second time by NP swab. Among those retested, the median IgG declined (p < 0.01) between tests. 25/139 donors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were negative for IgG antibodies. This suggests that having had the infection does not necessarily convey immunity, or there is a short duration of immunity associated with a decline in antibodies. Plasma viral load obtained on 35/39 plasma recipients showed 22 (62.9 %) had non-detectable levels on average 14.5 days from positive test versus 6.2 days in those with detectable levels (p < 0.01). There was a relationship between IgG and viral load. IgG was higher in those with non-detectable viral loads. There was no relationship between viral load and blood type (p = 0.87) or death (0.80). Recipients with detectable viral load had lower IgG levels; there was no relationship between viral load, blood type or death."
9786,SARS-CoV-2 Persistent Viral Shedding in the Context of Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin Treatment.,"SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal shedding contributes to the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. Among 3271 COVID-19 patients treated at the Hospital University Institute Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France from 3 March to 27 April 2020, tested at least twice by qRT-PCR, the median SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal shedding duration was 6 days (range 2-54 days). Compared with short shedders (qRT-PCR positivity < 10 days), 34 (1.04%) persistent shedders (qRT-PCR positivity ≥ 17 days; mean ± SD: 23.3 ± 3.8 days) were significantly older, with associated comorbidities, exhibiting lymphopenia, eosinopenia, increased D-dimer and increased troponin (p < 0.05), and were hospitalized in intensive care unit in 17.7% vs. 1.1% of cases (p < 0.0001). Viral culture was positive in six persistent shedders after day 10, including in one patient after day 17, and no viral co-pathogen was detected in 33 tested patients. Persistent shedders received azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine ≥ 3 days in 26/34 (76.5%) patients, a figure significantly lower than in short shedders (86.6%) (p = 0.042). Accordingly, mortality was 14.7% vs. 0.5% (p < 0.0001). Persistent shedding was significantly associated with persistent dyspnea and anosmia/ageusia (p < 0.05). In the context of COVID-19 treatment, including treatment with azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal shedding was a rare event, most frequently encountered in elderly patients with comorbidities and lacking azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine treatment."
9787,An evaluation of a FluoroSpot assay as a diagnostic tool to determine SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses.,"Numerous assays evaluating serological and cellular responses have been developed to characterize immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Serological assays are both cost- and time-effective compared to cellular assays, but cellular immune responses may provide a diagnostic value to determine previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in seronegative individuals. However, potential cross-reactive T cell responses stemming from prior encounters with human coronaviruses (HCoVs) may affect assay specificity. In this study, we evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of a SARS-CoV-2 IFN-γ Release Assay (IGRA) based on the FluoroSpot method employing commercially available SARS-CoV-2-specific peptide pools, as well as an in-house designed SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool restricted to 5 amino acid stretches or less aligning with endemic HCoVs. Blood samples were obtained from healthcare workers (HCW) 5-6 months post SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) IgG and nucleocapsid (N) IgG dual seroconversion (n = 187) and HCW who had been S IgG and N IgG dual seronegative at repeated occasions, including the current sampling time point (n = 102). In addition, samples were obtained 4 to 5 months post infection from 55 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Assay specificity and sensitivity were calculated with serology as a reference standard for HCW. The in-house generated peptide pool displayed a specificity of 96.1%, while the commercially available peptide pools displayed specificities of 80.4% and 85.3%, respectively. Sensitivity was higher in a cohort of previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients (96.4% and 84.0% for the commercially available peptide pools and 92.7% for the in-house generated peptide pool) compared to the HCW cohort (92.0% and 66.8% for the commercially available peptide pools and 76.0% for the in-house generated peptide pool). Based on these findings, the individual diagnostic value of T cell immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 currently appears to be limited but remain an important research tool ahead."
9788,"In Silico, In Vitro and In Cellulo Models for Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Spike/Human ACE2 Complex, Viral Entry and Cell Fusion.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Productive SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Indeed, viral entry into cells is mostly mediated by the early interaction between the viral spike protein S and its ACE2 receptor. The S/ACE2 complex is, thus, the first contact point between the incoming virus and its cellular target; consequently, it has been considered an attractive therapeutic target. To further characterize this interaction and the cellular processes engaged in the entry step of the virus, we set up various in silico, in vitro and in cellulo approaches that allowed us to specifically monitor the S/ACE2 association. We report here a computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex, as well as its biochemical and biophysical monitoring using pulldown, AlphaLISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding assays. This led us to determine the kinetic parameters of the S/ACE2 association and dissociation steps. In parallel to these in vitro approaches, we developed in cellulo transduction assays using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and HEK293T-ACE2 cell lines generated in-house. This allowed us to recapitulate the early replication stage of the infection mediated by the S/ACE2 interaction and to detect cell fusion induced by the interaction. Finally, a cell imaging system was set up to directly monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a cellular context and a flow cytometry assay was developed to quantify this association at the cell surface. Together, these different approaches are available for both basic and clinical research, aiming to characterize the entry step of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and its variants as well as to investigate the possible chemical modulation of this interaction. All these models will help in identifying new antiviral agents and new chemical tools for dissecting the virus entry step."
9789,Mutational analysis and assessment of its impact on proteins of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India.,"Mutational status of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India along with their impact on proteins was ascertained through multiple tools including MEGA, Genome Detective, SIFT, PROVEAN and ws-SNPs&GO. Excluding gaps and ambiguous sequences, 493 variable sites (152 parsimony informative and 341 singleton) were observed. NSP3 had the highest incidence of 101 sites followed by S protein (74), NSP12b (43) and ORF3a (31). Average mutations per sample for males and females was 2.56 and 2.88 respectively. Non-uniform geographical distribution of mutations suggests that sequences in some regions are mutating faster than others. There were 281 mutations (198 Neutral and 83 Disease) affecting amino acid sequence. NSP13 has a maximum of 14 Disease variants followed by S protein and ORF3a with 13 each. Disease mutations in genomes from asymptomatic people was mere 11% but those from deceased patients was at 38% indicating contribution of these mutations to the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2."
