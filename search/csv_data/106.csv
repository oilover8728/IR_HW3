1052,Optical technologies for the detection of viruses like COVID-19: Progress and prospects.,"The outbreak of life-threatening pandemic like COVID-19 necessitated the development of novel, rapid and cost-effective techniques that facilitate detection of viruses like SARS-CoV-2. The presently popular approach of a collection of samples using the nasopharyngeal swab method and subsequent detection of RNA using the real-time polymerase chain reaction suffers from false-positive results and a longer diagnostic time scale. Alternatively, various optical techniques namely optical sensing, spectroscopy, and imaging shows a great promise in virus detection. Herein, a comprehensive review of the various photonics technologies employed for virus detection, particularly the SARS-CoV family, is discussed. The state-of-art research activities in utilizing the photonics tools such as near-infrared spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence-based techniques, super-resolution microscopy, surface plasmon resonance-based detection, for virus detection accounted extensively with an emphasis on coronavirus detection. Further, an account of emerging photonics technologies of SARS-CoV-2 detection and future possibilities is also explained. The progress in the field of optical techniques for virus detection unambiguously show a great promise in the development of rapid photonics-based devices for COVID-19 detection."
1053,Highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by digital PCR.,"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel Coronavirus (termed SARS-CoV-2) has spread to over 210 countries around the world. Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. However, the sensitivity of RT-qPCR assays of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30% to 60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach. A reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) method was established and evaluated. To explore the feasibility of RT-dPCR in diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2, a total of 196 clinical pharyngeal swab samples from 103 suspected patients, 77 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents were analyzed by RT-qPCR and then measured by the proposed RT-dPCR. For the 103 fever suspected patients, 19 (19/25) negative and 42 (42/49) equivocal tested by RT-qPCR were positive according to RT-dPCR. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For 29 close contacts (confirmed by additional sample and clinical follow up), 16 (16/17) equivocal and 1 negative tested by RT-qPCR were positive according to RT-dPCR, which is implying that the RT-qPCR is missing a lot of asymptomatic patients. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 91%, 100% and 93%, respectively. RT-dPCR is highly accurate method and suitable for detection of pharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 suspected patients and patients under isolation and observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms."
1054,Saliva Is a Promising Alternative Specimen for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Children and Adults.,"Testing efforts for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been burdened by the scarcity of testing materials and personal protective equipment for health care workers. The simple and painless process of saliva collection allows for widespread testing, but enthusiasm is hampered by variable performance compared to that of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. We prospectively collected paired NPS and saliva samples from a total of 300 unique adult and pediatric patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 32.2% (97/300) of the individuals using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit (Thermo Fisher). Performance of saliva and NPS was compared against the total number of positives regardless of specimen type. The overall concordances for saliva and NPS were 91.0% (273/300) and 94.7% (284/300), respectively. The values for positive percent agreement (PPA) for saliva and NPS were 81.4% (79/97) and 89.7% (87/97), respectively. Saliva yielded detection of 10 positive cases that were negative by NPS. For symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients not previously diagnosed with COVID-19, the performances of saliva and NPS were comparable (PPA, 82.4% versus 85.3%). The overall values for PPA for adults were 83.3% and 90.7% for saliva and NPS, respectively, with saliva yielding detection of 4 fewer cases than NPS. However, saliva performance for symptomatic adults was identical to NPS performance (PPA of 93.8%). With lower cost and self-collection capabilities, saliva can be an appropriate sample choice alternative to NPS for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults."
1055,Molecular diagnostic assays for COVID-19: an overview.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the cardinal importance of rapid and accurate diagnostic assays. Since the early days of the outbreak, researchers with different scientific backgrounds across the globe have tried to fulfill the urgent need for such assays, with many assays having been approved and with others still undergoing clinical validation. Molecular diagnostic assays are a major group of tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Currently, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most widely used method. Other diagnostic molecular methods, including CRISPR-based assays, isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods, digital PCR, microarray assays, and next generation sequencing (NGS), are promising alternatives. In this review, we summarize the technical and clinical applications of the different COVID-19 molecular diagnostic assays and suggest directions for the implementation of such technologies in future infectious disease outbreaks."
1056,Development and Clinical Evaluation of an Immunochromatography-Based Rapid Antigen Test (GenBody COVAG025) for COVID-19 Diagnosis.,"Antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis are simpler and faster than their molecular counterparts. Clinical validation of such tests is a prerequisite before their field applications. We developed and clinically evaluated an immunochromatographic immunoassay, GenBody™ COVAG025, for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (NP) antigen in two different clinical studies. Retrospectively, 130 residual nasopharyngeal swabs transferred in viral transport medium (VTM), pre-examined for COVID-19 through emergency use authorization (EUA)-approved real-time RT-PCR assay and tested with GenBody™ COVAG025, revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 90.00% (27/30; 95% CI: 73.47% to 97.89%) and 98.00% (98/100; 95% CI: 92.96% to 99.76%), respectively, fulfilling WHO guidelines. Subsequently, the prospective examination of 200 symptomatic and asymptomatic nasopharyngeal swabs, collected on site and tested with GenBody™ COVAG025 and EUA-approved real-time RT-PCR assay simultaneously, revealed a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of 94.00% (94/100; 95% CI: 87.40% to 97.77%) and 100.00% (100/100; 95% CI: 96.38% to 100.00%), respectively. Clinical sensitivity and specificity were significantly high for samples with Ct values ≤ 30 as well as within 3 days of symptom onset, justifying its dependency on the viral load. Thus, it is assumed this can help with the accurate diagnosis and timely isolation and treatment of patients with COVID-19, contributing to better control of the global pandemic."

1058,"Determination of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with assays from Diasorin, Roche and IDvet.","There is an ongoing need for highly reliable serological assays to detect individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using 75 sera from patients tested positive or negative by SARS-CoV-2 PCR, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin), the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche), and the ID Screen SARS-CoV-2-N IgG indirect kit (IDVet). We determined a sensitivity of 95.5 %, 95.5 %, and 100 % and a specificity of 90.5 %, 96.2 %, and 92.5 % for the DiaSorin assay, the Roche assay, and the IDVet assay, respectively. We conclude that serologic assays combining very high sensitivity and specificity are still not commercially available for SARS-CoV-2. For maximizing sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 serological diagnostics, the combination of two assays may be helpful."
1059,SARS-CoV-2 variants: A double-edged sword?,"Since the worldwide emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak, there have been international concerns about the possible viral evolution into variants with underlying mutations that may contribute to their increased transmissibility, disease severity, risk of death, and their potential escape from the immune response or may even lead to its extinction. Rigorous surveillance has revealed the variants harboring mutations in the spike protein, the main target of neutralizing antibodies generated through vaccination or herd immunity. In this review, we have highlighted major SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as other local strains along with their specific mutations, suspected changes in their characteristics, and their impact on the current pandemic and vaccine efficacy. We have also emphasized the need to develop widely protective interventions to curb further transmission of variants."
