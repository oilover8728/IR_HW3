4280,Clinical testing for COVID-19.,"As the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 caused coronavirus disease 2019 cases in the United States, the initial test was developed and performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As the number of cases increased, the demand for tests multiplied, leading the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to use the Emergency Utilization Authorization to allow clinical and commercial laboratories to develop tests to detect the presence of the virus. Many nucleic acid tests based on RT-PCR were developed, each with different techniques, specifications, and turnaround time. As the illnesses turned into a pandemic, testing became more crucial. The test supply became inadequate to meet the need and so it had to be prioritized according to guidance. For surveillance, the need for serologic tests emerged. Here, we review the timeline of test development, the turnaround times, and the various approved tests, and compare them as regards the genes they detect. We concentrate on the point-of-care tests and discuss the basis for new serologic tests. We discuss the testing guidance for prioritization and their application in a hospital setting."
4281,Practical Diagnostic Accuracy of Nasopharyngeal Swab Testing for Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Introduction: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of COVID-19, which has had a devastating international impact. Prior reports of testing have reported low sensitivities of nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and reports of viral co-infections have varied from 0-20%. Therefore, we sought to determine the accuracy of nasopharyngeal PCR for COVID-19 and rates of viral co-infection. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients who received viral testing between March 1, 2020-April 28, 2020. Test results of a complete viral pathogen panel and COVID-19 testing were abstracted. We compared patients with more than one COVID-19 test for diagnostic accuracy against the gold standard of chart review. Results: We identified 1950 patients, of whom 1024 were tested for COVID-19. There were 221 repeat tests for COVID-19. Among patients with a repeat test, COVID-19 swabs had a sensitivity of 84.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 69.5-94.4%) and a specificity of 99.5% (95%CI, 97-100%) compared to a clinical and radiographic criterion reference by chart review. We found viral co-infection rates of 2.3% in patients without COVID-19 and 6.1% in patients with COVID-19. Rates of co-infection appeared to be related to base rates of infection in the community and not a specific property of COVID-19. Conclusion: COVID-19 nasopharyngeal PCR specimens are accurate but have imperfect sensitivity. Repeat testing for high-risk patients should be considered, and presence of an alternative virus should not be used to limit testing for COVID-19 for patients where it would affect treatment or isolation."
4282,"Investigating Racial Differences among Men in COVID-19 Diagnosis, and Related Psychosocial and Behavioral Factors: Data from the Michigan Men's Health Event.","Extant research is growing in its ability to explain sex differences in novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis and mortality. Moving beyond comparisons based on biological sex is now warranted to capture a more nuanced picture of disparities in COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality specifically among men who are more likely to die of the illness. The objective of this study was to investigate racial disparities in COVID-19-related psychosocial, behavior and health variables among men. The present study utilizes a sample of 824 men who participated in a free health event held in a Midwestern state. Chi-square analysis showed that African American men were more likely to report an adverse impact of COVID-19 based on several factors including experiencing more COVID-19-related medical issues (χ2 = 4.60 p = 0.03); higher COVID-19 diagnosis (χ2 = 4.60 p = 0.02); trouble paying for food (χ2 = 8.47, p = 0.00), rent (χ2 = 12.26, p = 0.00), medication (χ2 = 7.10 p = 0.01) and utility bills (χ2 = 19.68, p = 0.00); higher fear of contracting COVID-19 (χ2 = 31.19, p = 0.00); and higher rates of death of close friends and family due to COVID (χ2 = 48.85, p = 0.00). Non-Hispanic white men reported more increased stress levels due to COVID-19 compared to African American men (χ2 = 10.21, p = 0.01). Regression analysis showed that race was a significant predictor of self-reported COVID-19 diagnosis (OR = 2.56, p < 0.05) after controlling for demographic characteristics. The results showed that compared to non-Hispanic White men, African American men were more likely to report an adverse impact of COVID-19 based on several factors including experiencing more COVID-19-related medical issues; higher COVID-19 diagnosis; trouble paying for food, rent, medication and utility bills; higher fear of contracting COVID-19; and higher rates of death of close friends and family due to COVID. Interestingly, non-Hispanic white men reported more increased stress levels due to COVID-19 compared to African American men."
4283,National routine adult immunisation programmes among World Health Organization Member States: an assessment of health systems to deploy COVID-19 vaccines.,"IntroductionAs SARS-CoV-2 disproportionately affects adults, the COVID-19 pandemic vaccine response will rely on adult immunisation infrastructures.AimTo assess adult immunisation programmes in World Health Organization (WHO) Member States.MethodsWe evaluated country reports from 2018 on adult immunisation programmes sent to WHO and UNICEF. We described existing programmes and used multivariable regression to identify independent factors associated with having them.ResultsOf 194 WHO Member States, 120 (62%) reported having at least one adult immunisation programme. The Americas and Europe had the highest proportions of adult immunisation programmes, most commonly for hepatitis B and influenza vaccines (> 47% and > 91% of countries, respectively), while Africa and South-East Asia had the lowest proportions, with < 11% of countries reporting adult immunisation programmes for hepatitis B or influenza vaccines, and none for pneumococcal vaccines. In bivariate analyses, high or upper-middle country income, introduction of new or underused vaccines, having achieved paediatric immunisation coverage goals and meeting National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups basic functional indicators were significantly associated (p < 0.001) with having an adult immunisation programme. In multivariable analyses, the most strongly associated factor was country income, with high- or upper-middle-income countries significantly more likely to report having an adult immunisation programme (adjusted odds ratio: 19.3; 95% confidence interval: 6.5-57.7).DiscussionWorldwide, 38% of countries lack adult immunisation programmes. COVID-19 vaccine deployment will require national systems for vaccine storage and handling, delivery and waste management to target adult risk groups. There is a need to strengthen immunisation systems to reach adults with COVID-19 vaccines."
4284,Persistent Headache and Persistent Anosmia Associated With COVID-19.,"Respiratory symptoms are the predominant symptoms in COVID‐19. However, 6.5 to 71% of patients with this disease have headaches (in most studies, between 11 and 14%).1 Despite this, little is known about the characteristics of this headache, its repercussions, or its temporal evolution.1 We describe here a case of persistent headache associated with COVID‐19."
4285,Impaired Humoral Response in Renal Transplant Recipients to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech).,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a major impact on transplant recipients, with mortality rates up to 20%. Therefore, the effect of established messenger RNA (mRNA)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have to be evaluated for solid organ transplant patients (SOT) since they are known to have poor responses after vaccination. We investigated the SARS-CoV-2 immune response via SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection in 23 renal transplant recipients after two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 following the standard protocol. The antibody response was evaluated once with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG CLIA 15.8 +/- 3.0 days after the second dose. As a control, SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined in 23 healthcare workers (HCW) and compared to the patient cohort. Only 5 of 23 (22%) renal transplant recipients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies after the second dose of vaccine. In contrast, all 23 (100%) HCWs were tested positive for antibodies after the second dose. Thus, the humoral response of renal transplant recipients after two doses of the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, Kronach, Germany) is impaired and significantly lower compared to healthy controls (22% vs. 100%; p = 0.0001). Individual vaccination strategies might be beneficial in these vulnerable patients."

4289,Vaccine response following anti-CD20 therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 905 patients.,"The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on vaccine responsiveness in patients who have received anti-CD20 therapy. PubMed and EMBASE were searched up to 4 January 2021 to identify studies of vaccine immunogenicity in patients treated with anti-CD20 therapy, including patients with hematologic malignancy or autoimmune disease. The primary outcomes were seroprotection (SP), seroconversion (SC), and/or seroresponse rates for each type of vaccine reported. As the pandemic influenza vaccine (2009 H1N1) has standardized definitions for SP and SC, and represented a novel primary antigen similar to the COVID-19 vaccine, meta-analysis was conducted for SC of studies of this vaccine. Pooled estimates, relative benefit ratios (RBs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Thirty-eight studies (905 patients treated with anti-CD20 therapy) were included (19 studies of patients with hematologic malignancies). Patients on active (<3 months since last dose) anti-CD20 therapy had poor responses to all types of vaccines. The pooled estimate for SC after 1 pandemic influenza vaccine dose in these patients was 3% (95% CI, 0% to 9%), with an RB of 0.05 (95% CI, 0-0.73) compared with healthy controls and 0.22 (95% CI, 0.09-0.56) compared with disease controls. SC compared with controls seems abrogated for at least 6 months following treatment (3-6 months post anti-CD20 therapy with an RB of 0.50 [95% CI, 0.24-1.06] compared with healthy and of 0.44 [95% CI, 0.23-0.84] compared with disease controls). For all vaccine types, response to vaccination improves incrementally over time, but may not reach the level of healthy controls even 12 months after therapy."
