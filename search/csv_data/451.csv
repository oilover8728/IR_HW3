4501,First-Dose mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Allergic Reactions: Limited Role for Excipient Skin Testing.,"Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that a severe or immediate allergic reaction to the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a contraindication for the second dose. Objective: To assess outcomes associated with excipient skin testing after a reported allergic reaction to the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: We identified a consecutive sample of patients with reported allergic reactions after the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine who underwent allergy assessment with skin testing to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and, when appropriate, polysorbate 80. Skin testing results in conjunction with clinical phenotyping of the first-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reaction guided second-dose vaccination recommendation. Second-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reactions were assessed. Results: Eighty patients with reported first-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine allergic reactions (n = 65; 81% immediate onset) underwent excipient skin testing. Of those, 14 (18%) had positive skin tests to PEG (n = 5) and/or polysorbate 80 (n = 12). Skin testing result did not affect tolerance of the second dose in patients with immediate or delayed reactions. Of the 70 patients who received the second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose (88%), 62 had either no reaction or a mild reaction managed with antihistamines (89%), but 2 patients required epinephrine treatment. Three patients with positive PEG-3350 intradermal (methylprednisolone) testing tolerated second-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Refresh Tears caused nonspecific skin irritation. Conclusions: Most individuals with a reported allergic reaction to the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of skin test result, received the second dose safely. More data are needed on the value of skin prick testing to PEG (MiraLAX) in evaluating patients with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine anaphylaxis. Refresh Tears should not be used for skin testing."

4504,Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A New Surgical Patient Flow Utilizing the Preoperative Evaluation Clinic.,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the study institution recognized the importance of providing preoperative COVID-19 testing and symptom screening to ensure patient safety. A multidisciplinary quality improvement team used Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control methodology to understand the issues, identify solutions, and streamline patient flow. The existing preoperative evaluation (POE) clinic was utilized as a centralized entity to provide COVID-19 testing, symptom screening, and infection prevention education in addition to routine preoperative medical optimization. With the new process, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 testing results returned before surgery increased from 10% to 100%. Of the 593 asymptomatic patients screened by the POE clinic, 2 were found to have positive results. These patients had their surgeries postponed until proper recovery. The study institution has extended this new process to all surgical patients, warranting facility readiness for the resumption of elective surgery."
4505,Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity.,"Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic."

We worked together as part of a multidisciplinary team to support the large-scale processing of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swabs from across the whole of the UK."

4508,Outcome Reporting Bias in COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Clinical Trials.,"Relative risk reduction and absolute risk reduction measures in the evaluation of clinical trial data are poorly understood by health professionals and the public. The absence of reported absolute risk reduction in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials can lead to outcome reporting bias that affects the interpretation of vaccine efficacy. The present article uses clinical epidemiologic tools to critically appraise reports of efficacy in Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine clinical trials. Based on data reported by the manufacturer for Pfzier/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2, this critical appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 95.1%; 95% CI, 90.0% to 97.6%; p = 0.016; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; 95% CI, 0.59% to 0.83%; p < 0.000. For the Moderna vaccine mRNA-1273, the appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 94.1%; 95% CI, 89.1% to 96.8%; p = 0.004; absolute risk reduction, 1.1%; 95% CI, 0.97% to 1.32%; p < 0.000. Unreported absolute risk reduction measures of 0.7% and 1.1% for the Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, are very much lower than the reported relative risk reduction measures. Reporting absolute risk reduction measures is essential to prevent outcome reporting bias in evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy."
4509,A novel ORF1a-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay to resolve inconclusive samples.,"Background: India bears the second largest burden of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A multitude of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection assays with disparate gene targets, including automated high-throughput platforms, are available. Varying concordance and interpretation of diagnostic results in this setting can result in significant reporting delays, leading to suboptimal disease management. This article reports the development of a novel ORF1a-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay - Viroselect - that shows high concordance with conventional assays and the ability to resolve inconclusive results generated during the peak of the epidemic in Mumbai, India. Methods: A unique target region within SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a - the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) region - was used to design and develop the assay. This hypervariable region (1923-3956) between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was utilized to design the primers and probes for the RT-PCR assay. The concordance of this assay with commonly used emergency use authorization (US Food and Drug Administration) manual kits and an automated high-throughput testing platform was evaluated. Further, a retrospective analysis was carried out using Viroselect on samples reported as 'inconclusive' between April and October 2020. Results: In total, 701 samples were tested. Concordance analysis of 477 samples demonstrated high overall agreement of Viroselect with both manual (87.6%) and automated (84.7%) assays. Also, in the retrospective analysis of 224 additional samples reported as 'inconclusive', Viroselect was able to resolve 100% (19/19) and 93.7% (192/205) of samples which had inconclusive results on manual and automated high-throughput platforms, respectively. Conclusion: Viroselect had high concordance with conventional assays, both manual and automated, and has potential to resolve inconclusive samples."
