6200,"SARS-CoV-2 vaccination complicated by acute, disseminated encephalo-myelitis?",
6201,Progress in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and the role of surgeons in the front line of the pandemic.,"The current struggle to control and contain COVID-19 is critical and surgeons are on the front line in the fight against this virus. Surgeons, and other medical workers in the field of surgery, have a solid foundation and experience in medical treatment and intensive care, and an understanding of the support of respiratory, circulatory, digestive, and other systemic organs. Furthermore, the operative standards of aseptic technique in their daily work enable surgeons to adapt to the working environment in infected areas. As surgeons in the anti-pandemic front line in China, we describe our experience with the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in this country and how the work of surgeons is unfolding during the pandemic."
6202,Biphasic anaphylaxis after exposure to the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.,"In the setting of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic and increased disease burden, vaccination has become one of the major solutions. With the increase in vaccination numbers worldwide, it is important to stay vigilant to the potential side effects and life-threatening complications of such vaccines. We report the case of a 30-year-old male with a biphasic allergic reaction post messenger (mRNA) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination. Several reports of allergic reactions have been cited in the literature after the administration of the mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It is important to keep a high index of suspicion in severe anaphylactic cases as some patients may have a recurrence of symptoms after discharge. It is crucial to acknowledge the potential risk of anaphylaxis in select individuals and have the appropriate measures in place to deal with adverse events. In case of severe symptoms, the administration of epinephrine is advised to prevent the development of a delayed biphasic anaphylactic reaction."
6203,Should Asymptomatic and Low-Risk Individuals be Tested for SARS-CoV-2?,
6204,A short perspective on a COVID-19 clinical study: 'diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-PCR using exhale breath condensate samples'.,"Diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection (COVID-19) is currently based on detection of the viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, sampling via nasopharyngeal swabs frequently provokes sneezing or coughing, which results in increased risk of the viral dissemination and environmental contamination. Furthermore, the sensitivity associated with the PCR tests s limited to 60%-70%, which is mainly attributable to technical deficiency in sampling. Given that the disease is transmitted via exhaled aerosol and droplets, and that the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is the established modality for sampling exhaled aerosol, detection of the viral RNA in EBC is a promising approach for safe and efficient diagnosis of the disease. Subjects are those patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test and admitted to Saitama Medical Center, Japan. EBC samples will be collected using an R-tube® or R-tubeVent® device. Collected EBC samples will be introduced into a nucleic acid purifier. The purified nucleic acids will undergo amplification through RT-PCR for detection and quantification of SARS-COV-2 RNA. To date we have collected eight samples from seven subjects. Among them, two samples from two subjects tested positive for SARS-COV-2 RNA by the RT-PCR. Reflecting the second wave of COVID-19 prevalence in Japan, new admissions of COVID-19 patients to the Saitama Medical Center are increasing, and we are expecting to collect at least 50 EBC samples from 25 patients before the end of this year."
6205,Late Corneal Stromal Deposits After COVID-19.,"We present 2 cases of striking stromal corneal infiltrates months after COVID-19 infection. While we cannot prove that these infiltrates are caused by or directly related to COVID-19, we did not find any other plausible cause that could explain these ophthalmic signs. In these cases, the ongoing process was detected in relatively early stages due to scheduled visits with patients and responded positively to prednisolone acetate 1% ophthalmic suspension. However, we do not know the response to treatment in more advanced cases."
6206,The accuracy of healthcare worker versus self collected (2-in-1) Oropharyngeal and Bilateral Mid-Turbinate (OPMT) swabs and saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: Self-sampling for SARS-CoV-2 would significantly raise testing capacity and reduce healthcare worker (HCW) exposure to infectious droplets personal, and protective equipment (PPE) use. Methods: We conducted a diagnostic accuracy study where subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n = 401) and healthy volunteers (n = 100) were asked to self-swab from their oropharynx and mid-turbinate (OPMT), and self-collect saliva. The results of these samples were compared to an OPMT performed by a HCW in the same patient at the same session. Results: In subjects confirmed to have COVID-19, the sensitivities of the HCW-swab, self-swab, saliva, and combined self-swab plus saliva samples were 82.8%, 75.1%, 74.3% and 86.5% respectively. All samples obtained from healthy volunteers were tested negative. Compared to HCW-swab, the sensitivities of a self-swab sample and saliva sample were inferior by 8.7% (95%CI: 2.4% to 15.0%, p = 0.006) and 9.5% (95%CI: 3.1% to 15.8%, p = 0.003) respectively. The combined detection rate of self-swab and saliva had a sensitivity of 2.7% (95%CI: -2.6% to 8.0%, p = 0.321). The sensitivity of both the self-collection methods are higher when the Ct value of the HCW swab is less than 30. The specificity of both the self-swab and saliva testing was 100% (95% CI 96.4% to 100%). Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that sensitivities of self-collected OPMT swab and saliva samples were inferior to a HCW swab, but they could still be useful testing tools in the appropriate clinical settings."
6207,"Quantifying healthcare and welfare sector workers' preferences around COVID-19 vaccination: a cross-sectional, single-profile discrete-choice experiment in France.","Objectives: To analyse preferences around promotion of COVID-19 vaccination among workers in the healthcare and welfare sector in Fance at the start of the vaccination campaign. Design: Single-profile discrete-choice experiment. Respondents in three random blocks chose between accepting or rejecting eight hypothetical COVID-19 vaccination scenarios. Setting: 4346 healthcare and welfare sector workers in France, recruited through nation-wide snowball sampling, December 2020 to January 2021. Outcome: The primary outcomes were the effects of attributes' levels on hypothetical acceptance, expressed as ORs relative to the reference level. The secondary outcome was vaccine eagerness as certainty of decision, ranging from -10 to +10. Results: Among all participants, 61.1% made uniform decisions, including 17.2% always refusing vaccination across all scenarios (serial non-demanders). Among 1691 respondents making variable decisions, a strong negative impact on acceptance was observed with 50% vaccine efficacy (compared with 90% efficacy: OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.06) and the mention of a positive benefit-risk balance (compared with absence of severe and frequent side effects: OR 0.40, 0.34 to 0.46). The highest positive impact was the prospect of safely meeting older people and contributing to epidemic control (compared with no indirect protection: OR 4.10, 3.49 to 4.82 and 2.87, 2.34 to 3.50, respectively). Predicted acceptance was 93.8% for optimised communication on messenger RNA vaccines and 16.0% for vector-based vaccines recommended to ≥55-year-old persons. Vaccine eagerness among serial non-demanders slightly but significantly increased with the prospect of safely meeting older people and epidemic control and reduced with lower vaccine efficacy. Discussion: Vaccine promotion towards healthcare and welfare sector workers who hesitate or refuse vaccination should avoid the notion of benefit-risk balance, while collective benefit communication with personal utility can lever acceptance. Vaccines with limited efficacy will unlikely achieve high uptake."
6208,Presentation of new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Introduction: Anosmia has not been formally recognised as a symptom of COVID-19 infection. Growing anecdotal evidence suggests increasing incidence of cases of anosmia during the current pandemic, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause olfactory dysfunction. The objective was to characterise patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODOLOGY: Design: Survey of 2428 patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Setting: Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell RESULTS: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 days; 64% respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last week. Of the cohort, 17% did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation. Conclusions: Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom. This might help identify otherwise asymptomatic carriers of disease and trigger targeted testing. Further study with COVID-19 testing is required to identify the proportion of patients in whom new onset anosmia can be attributed to COVID-19."
6209,Higher 90-Day Mortality after Surgery for Hip Fractures in Patients with COVID-19: A Case-Control Study from a Single Center in Italy.,"The mortality of hip fracture (HF) patients is increased by concomitant COVID-19; however, evidence is limited to only short follow-up. A retrospective matched case-control study was designed with the aim to report the 90-day mortality and determine the hazard ratio (HR) of concomitant HF and COVID-19 infection. Cases were patients hospitalized for HF and diagnosed with COVID-19. Controls were patients hospitalized for HF not meeting the criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis and were individually matched with each case through a case-control (1:3) matching algorithm. A total of 89 HF patients were treated during the study period, and 14 of them were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive (overall 15.7%). Patients' demographic, clinical, and surgical characteristics were similar between case and control groups. At 90 days after surgery, 5 deaths were registered among the 14 COVID-19 cases (35.7%) and 4 among the 42 HF controls (9.5%). COVID-19-positive cases had a higher risk of mortality at 30 days (HR = 4.51; p = 0.0490) and 90 days (HR = 4.50; p = 0.025) with respect to controls. Patients with concomitant HF and COVID-19 exhibit high perioperative mortality, which reaches a plateau of nearly 30-35% after 30 to 45 days and is stable up to 90 days. The mortality risk is more than four-fold higher in patients with COVID-19."
