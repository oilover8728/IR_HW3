9642,[The Leon Fredericq Foundation against COVID-19 in Liege].,"The Leon Fredericq Foundation gives support to the clinicians and the scientists of the Uliege and of the CHU of Liege in order to push back the frontiers of biomedical science and to contribute to improve the care and cure of patients. Since the outbreak due to COVID-19, the Foundation has given out a call for donations in order to support urgent procedures for taking care of COVID-19 suffering patients. Furthermore, by raising important financial means, the Foundation has selected thirteen research projects aiming at a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2-induced disease."
9643,Symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection: healthcare workers and immunosuppressed individuals at high risk.,"Background: Knowledge regarding factors predicting the SARS-COV-2 reinfection risk is scarce and it has major implications in public health policies. We aimed to identify factors associated with the risk of symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection. Methods: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study and 99,993 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were analyzed. Results: The overall risk of reinfection (28 or more elapsed days between both episodes onset) was 0.21% (incidence density, 2.5 reinfections per 100,000 person-days) and older subjects and those with the mild primary disease were at reduced risk of the event. Healthcare workers and immunosuppressed or renal patients had at greater risk of SARS-COV-2 reinfection. Conclusions: If replicated in other populations, these results may be useful to prioritize efforts focusing on the reduction of SARS-COV-2 spread and the related burden."
9644,[Role of physical and rehabilitation medicine in the aftermath of SARS-CoV-2 disease].,"2020 will be remembered as the year of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic which confined most of the world's population at home. Rehabilitation units will have to face specific challenges to protect the vulnerable in-patients. Moreover, they must prepare for post-COVID-19 patients who might suffer from illness consequences or present a post intensive care syndrome secondary to the increased ICU length of stay. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the deficiencies of post-COVID-19 patients and suggest a decision algorithm to best match their needs."
9645,Rhabdomyolysis as Potential Late Complication Associated with COVID-19.,"We describe a patient in Wuhan, China, with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who had progressive pulmonary lesions and rhabdomyolysis with manifestations of lower limb pain and fatigue. Rapid clinical recognition of rhabdomyolysis symptoms in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can be lifesaving."
9646,NF-kappaB Pathway as a Potential Target for Treatment of Critical Stage COVID-19 Patients.,"Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild febrile illness and cough up to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, and death. Data from patients with severe clinical manifestations compared to patients with mild symptoms indicate that highly dysregulated exuberant inflammatory responses correlate with severity of disease and lethality. Epithelial-immune cell interactions and elevated cytokine and chemokine levels, i.e. cytokine storm, seem to play a central role in severity and lethality in COVID-19. The present perspective places a central cellular pro-inflammatory signal pathway, NF-κB, in the context of recently published data for COVID-19 and provides a hypothesis for a therapeutic approach aiming at the simultaneous inhibition of whole cascades of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The simultaneous inhibition of multiple cytokines/chemokines is expected to have much higher therapeutic potential as compared to single target approaches to prevent cascade (i.e. redundant, triggering, amplifying, and synergistic) effects of multiple induced cytokines and chemokines in critical stage COVID-19 patients."
9647,[What should urologists know about SARS-CoV-2? Risk analysis for urological operations and recommendations for action in clinical routine].,"Background: COVID-19 poses a challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Due to the increasing number of cases, surgeons in urology have also been confronted with SARS-CoV‑2 infections. Thus, there is an urgent need for clinical guidance and recommendations. Aim: Our work aims to create a widespread assessment of a possible risk for infection with SARS-CoV‑2 during surgical procedures. Based on current data and current national and international guidelines, we try to assess the risk of infection when handling human tissue and the necessary hygienic measures that are needed. Finally, recommendations for daily urologic work are derived and explained. Materials and methods: The current literature in PubMed, bioRxiv and medRxiv and data available from the WHO and Robert-Koch-Institut on SARS-CoV‑2 and surgical procedures in (potentially) infected patients are reviewed. The endpoint of our research was 21 April 2020. Conclusion: Based on our research, general and specific recommendations for clinical urologic praxis can be derived. Although it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV‑2 is transmitted via the aerosols produced, current PPE in operating rooms probably does not offer sufficient protection during surgical interventions during the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic. Use of FFP‑2 masks, safety goggles and full-body protective suits is crucial. To contain viral spread on surfaces and personnel, complex filter systems (HEPA) should be used as well as closed suction devices during surgery. Combined with consequent disinfection of surfaces and behavioral measures, a safe environment for healthcare workers in urology can be created. Thus, according to current knowledge, we believe that emergency and urgent surgical procedures are not contraindicated, provided that appropriate precautionary safety measures are followed."
9648,Phylogenetic analysis of the first four SARS-CoV-2 cases in Chile.,"The current pandemic caused by the new coronavirus is a worldwide public health concern. To aboard this emergency, and like never before, scientific groups around the world have been working in a fast and coordinated way to get the maximum of information about this virus when it has been almost 3 months since the first cases were detected in Wuhan province in China. The complete genome sequences of around 450 isolates are available, and studies about similarities and differences among them and with the close related viruses that caused similar epidemics in this century. In this work, we studied the complete genome of the first four cases of the new coronavirus disease in Chile, from patients who traveled to Europe and Southeast Asia. Our findings reveal at least two different viral variants entries to Chilean territory, coming from Europe and Asia. We also sub-classified the isolates into variants according to punctual mutations in the genome. Our work contributes to global information about transmission dynamics and the importance to take control measures to stop the spread of the infection."
