3930,COVID-19 vaccination campaign: dialogues with nurses working in Primary Health Care.,"Objective: To reflect on the perception of nurses working in Primary Health Care about the development of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Method: This is a participatory action qualitative study, based on the methodological theoretical precepts by Paulo Freire, which consists of three interconnected phases: Thematic Research, Coding and Decoding, and Critical Unveiling. Three virtual Culture Circles were held between February and March 2021, with 11 nurses from Primary Health Care, residing in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Results: Nurses defined two themes for discussion in the Culture Circle: 1. Matches in the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, representing the potentialities; 2. Mismatches in the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, in which the weaknesses were revealed. Conclusion: Nurses indicated potentialities such as teamwork, with hope, motivation, and joy in the vaccination campaign operationalization, through innovative and old actions. They also highlighted weaknesses such as lack of specific training and communication, difficulties with recording and application of the immunobiological, mentioning the anti-vaccine movement and the intense work, which requires adjustments to improve assistance to the population."
3931,Vaccines for a healthy future: 21st DCVMN Annual General Meeting 2020 report.,"The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers' Network held its 21st Annual General Meeting virtually in November 2020 given the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccine manufacturing experts, leaders from local and global public health organizations and multilateral organizations, through diverse presentations, questions and answers, focused on the pandemic and the response of vaccine manufacturers where many are engaged in research and development and production agreements. The pandemic is expanding rapidly which makes the global availability and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines critical. Strategies put in place include the establishment of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) within which the COVAX facility aims to distribute 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2021, with procurement mechanisms already being established. At the same time, regulatory authorities have emergency use authorizations aimed at the rapid approval of safe and effective vaccines, with a push for harmonization in regulatory approaches being advocated. The Meeting was also apprised of other innovations being developed for vaccines including multi-array patches for easier vaccine application, increased heat stability for mitigating cold chain and storage challenges, the barcoding of primary packaging for enhancing vaccine traceability, and gathering data for decision-making. Over time, these innovations will facilitate the widespread availability and equitable access of vaccines including those addressing epidemics and pandemics. In addition, a number of manufacturers described technologies they have for accelerating vaccine manufacturing and supply globally. Overall, there was agreement that manufacturers from developing countries play a critical role in the global research, development and supply of vaccines for a healthy future, with increasing collaboration and partnering between them a growing strength."

This flood of articles can be overwhelming for busy practicing clinicians looking for key pieces of information that can be applied in daily practice. This review article synthesizes the reported imaging findings in pediatric Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the literature, offers imaging differential diagnostic considerations and useful radiographic features to help differentiate these entities from COVID-19, and provides recommendations for requesting imaging studies to evaluate suspected cases of pediatric COVID-19."

3936,Kinetics of torquetenovirus DNA load in a recent kidney transplant recipient with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and a failed antibody response.,"Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 because of their immunosuppressed state. A 42-year-old KT patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 three months after KT. Despite lymphopenia and several risk factors, he had a mild disease course. Nasopharyngeal real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 became negative 48 days after detection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies became negative after day 40. TTV DNA load increased with the onset COVID-19 and reduced after its resolution. This is the first report where TTV DNA load was measured during the course of COVID-19."

Measurement by serologic correlates without biocontainment needs as well as an understanding of donor characteristics that may allow for targeting of more potent donors would greatly facilitate effective collection. Study design and methods: One hundred convalescent plasma units were characterized for functionally active SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, as well as for SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies, with the intention to establish a correlation between the functionally more relevant neutralization assay and the more accessible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Donor demographics such as COVID-19 severity, age, and sex were correlated with antibody titers. Results: A mean neutralization titer 50% of 230 (range, <8-1765) was seen for the 100 convalescent plasma units, with highly significant (P < .0001) yet quantitatively limited (R2 = 0.2830) correlation with results of the ELISA. Exclusion of units with particularly high titers (>500) from analysis improved correlation (R2 = 0.5386). A tendency of higher-titer plasma units from donors with increased disease severity, of advanced age, and of male sex was seen, yet the functional relevance of this difference is questionable. Conclusion: The ELISA-based correlation to neutralization titer enabled a threshold proposal that could be used to eliminate lower-titer units from the clinical supply for COVID-19 treatment. Disease severity may be associated with the development of higher titers of neutralizing antibodies, although larger case numbers will be needed for additional confirmation."
