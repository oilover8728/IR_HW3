2363,Rapid Detection of COVID-19 Causative Virus (SARS-CoV-2) in Human Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens Using Field-Effect Transistor-Based Biosensor.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging human infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously called 2019-nCoV). Based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Because no specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing the outbreak. Here, we report a field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The sensor was produced by coating graphene sheets of the FET with a specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The performance of the sensor was determined using antigen protein, cultured virus, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients. Our FET device could detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline and 100 fg/mL clinical transport medium. In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6 × 101 pfu/mL) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42 × 102 copies/mL). Thus, we have successfully fabricated a promising FET biosensor for SARS-CoV-2; our device is a highly sensitive immunological diagnostic method for COVID-19 that requires no sample pretreatment or labeling."
2364,Comparison of viral load between saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV2: the role of days of symptoms onset on diagnosis.,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious causing millions of deaths worldwide. Nasopharyngeal swabs are the primary sample of choice for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus, to decrease the exposure to potentially infected samples through the collection is a key point to reduce the risk of infection in healthcare workers. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and viral load of saliva specimens by days of symptoms onset comparing to nasopharyngeal swabs in subjects with mild symptoms. Methods: Saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from São Paulo Hospital workers presenting mild symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, headaches, anosmia, ageusia, and fatigue. To understand the positivity and viral load, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed. Findings: Saliva specimens presented a sensitivity of 98.6% compared to nasopharyngeal swabs. Overall, saliva showed lower viral load compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, regarding days of symptoms onset on diagnosis, the first four days had significant changes in viral load and no significant difference was reported in the days five to nine. Main conclusions: Although RT-PCR of saliva has presented a lower viral load compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva specimens are a potential and reliable candidate for COVID-19 diagnosis through RT-PCR."

2366,Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with immune reconstitution therapies.,"Background: It has been generally accepted that people with MS (PwMS) should be vaccinated against COVID-19. The aim of our investigation was to evaluate the humoral response to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and to two COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech and Beijing/Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV) in our cohort of PwMS under high efficacy disease modifying therapies (DMTs), cladribine and alemtuzumab. Methods: Twenty two PwMS treated at the Clinic of Neurology, in Belgrade, who developed COVID-19 and/or were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, during treatment with cladribine and alemtuzumab, were included. Out of 18 patients treated with cladribine, 11 developed COVID-19, and 11 were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (four with mRNA vaccine, 7 with Sinopharm). Four MS patients under alemtuzumab were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2; three with mRNA, and one with Sinopharm vaccine. SARS-Cov-2 IgG response was measured using ELISA anti-spike protein-based serology (INEP, Belgrade, Serbia). Results: All 7 patients under cladribine treatment who suffered from COVID-19, developed IgG antibodies, 2.0-5.5 months after last symptoms. All four (100%) patients under cladribine who were vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and three out of seven (42.9%) vaccinated with Sinopharm, developed antibodies. All 4 patients under alemtuzumab developed antibodies after vaccination. In all cases, seroprotection occurred, irrespective of timing of vaccination and absolute lymphocyte count. Conclusion: Our findings in a small number of highly active PwMS in whom, lymphodepleting, immune reconstitution therapies, were applied in order to successfully manage MS, indicate that in a number of these patients it was possible to develop at the same time seroprotection in these patients after COVID-19 vaccination in these complex circumstances."
2367,Cochrane corner: rapid point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.,"Introduction: the COVID-19 pandemic, which results from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), presents important diagnostic challenges. Diagnostic strategies available to identify or rule out current infection, or to identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response have become available, to reduce household and community transmission. We highlight a Cochrane review, published in September 2020, on the assessment of diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests to determine current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: the authors of the Cochrane review searched multiple electronic databases for studies, which assessed SARS-CoV-2 infection with a diagnostic test. Eligible participants for the review included people with suspected current SARS-CoV-2 infection, known to have, or not to have COVID-19 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. Results: the authors included 18 studies of point-of-care tests conducted in various parts of the world, with none from Africa. The review shows that there is considerable variability in sensitivity and specificity of the antigen tests. The review also shows that molecular tests had less variability in sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: the review suggests that the current evidence is not strong enough to determine the usefulness of point-of-care tests in all settings. However, the benefits are likely to be more noticeable in countries, like Africa where community transmission is high. An impact evaluation would be warranted when rapid point-of-care tests are implemented in African countries."

2369,Drive-through testing in COVID-19: experience from NHS Lothian.,"The growing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 challenges healthcare resources globally and mandates innovation. We describe our novel drive-through coronavirus testing which we used for testing of possible cases in the contain phase of UK response and are now using for healthcare worker testing. We found that this system was pragmatic, cost-efficient and favourable for patients. It is easily modifiable for use in future infectious disease outbreaks."
