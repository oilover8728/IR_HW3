2350,Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Recent World Health Organization guidance has aimed to provide pragmatic guidance acknowledging the role of sequential nasopharyngeal swabs taken >24 hours apart for SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are known to have an altered immune milieu which may be associated with a delay in viral clearance. Here, a cross-sectional observational study of 138 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection at two large regional hospitals in Scotland, UK examined the median time to two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 in an inpatient population. The median time from admission to the first of two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs was 18 days (range = 1-44) in patients with CKD, compared with 11 days (range: 1-71) in patients without CKD (P = .0007). Multivariable linear regression analysis using explanatory variables of age, sex, SARS-CoV-2 disease severity, key comorbidities and renal function showed that declining estimated glomerular filtration rate was independently associated with prolonged time to viral clearance. Our data suggest that patients with CKD who are admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 take longer to achieve sequential negative nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results than those without CKD. This has implications for renal service provision, discharge planning and hospital capacity as well as a direct impact on patients due to extended hospital stay, anxiety and stigmatisation."
2351,"A Fast and Accessible Method for the Isolation of RNA, DNA, and Protein To Facilitate the Detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Management of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires widespread testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A main limitation for widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is the global shortage of essential supplies, among them RNA extraction kits. The need for commercial RNA extraction kits places a bottleneck on tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, including PCR-based reference tests. Here, we propose an alternative method we call PEARL (precipitation-enhanced analyte retrieval) that addresses this limitation. PEARL uses a lysis solution that disrupts cell membranes and viral envelopes while simultaneously providing conditions suitable for alcohol-based precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins. PEARL is a fast, low-cost, and simple method that uses common laboratory reagents and offers performance comparable to that of commercial RNA extraction kits. PEARL offers an alternative method to isolate host and pathogen nucleic acids and proteins to streamline the detection of DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2."
2352,Potential COVID-19 Therapeutic Agents and Vaccines: An Evidence-Based Review.,"Since the early days of 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has become a global health concern. Currently, some therapies and vaccines have received US Food and Drug Administration approval or emergency use authorization for the management of coronavirus disease 2019. According to the pathophysiology of the disease, several medications have been evaluated in different clinical conditions of the disease. Evidence-based reviewing and categorizing these medications can guide the clinicians to select the proper medications according to each patient's condition. Therefore, we performed this review to categorize the coronavirus disease 2019 potential therapeutics and vaccines."

2354,"Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers in a nonepidemic region, Japan: A hospital-based study on May, 2020.","The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing rate is low in our local area and the true rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection may include many asymptomatic individuals. We conducted a serosurveillance using antibody testing in an area where official report of COVID-19 infection is not done yet. Blood samples were obtained from 1404 healthcare workers (41 Â± 11 years) in our hospital on May 29-31, 2020. First, the potential infection frequency was confirmed using two quantitative antibody tests. In addition, the usefulness of rapid antibody kit testing for COVID-19 serosurveillance was examined. A COVID-19-indected case was defined as showing positive results in both quantitative tests. None of 1404 samples had positive results from the two quantitative tests. The false positive rates were 0.36% and 0.07%, whereas those in rapid antibody kits were 3.3% and 3.0%. In conclusion, as of May, 2020, potential spread mainly by asymptomatic individuals infected with COVID-19 was not found in our local area where there was no official report of COVID-19, even if the PCR testing rate was low. Rapid antibody kits might not be useful due to the high false positive rate in an area with a low incidence of COVID-19 infected individuals."
2355,"Low clinical performance of the Isopollo COVID-19 detection kit (M Monitor, South Korea) for RT-LAMP SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis: A call for action against low quality products for developing countries.","Background: Multiple molecular kits are available for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide, with many lacking proper clinical evaluation due to the emergency caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, particularly in developing countries. Methods: This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of the Isopollo COVID-19 detection kit (M Monitor, South Korea) for reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, using the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocol as the gold standard. Results: A total of 220 clinical samples were included in the study; 168 samples were SARS-CoV-2-positive and 52 samples were SARS-CoV-2-negative according to the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR protocol. For the Isopollo COVID-19 detection kit, only 104 out of 168 samples were SARS-CoV-2-positive. This result shows a low clinical performance, with sensitivity of 61.9% for the evaluated RT-LAMP assay. Conclusions: Proper clinical performance evaluation studies by regulatory agencies in developing countries such as Ecuador should be mandatory prior to clinical use authorization of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis kits, particularly when those kits lack either US Food and Drug Administration or country of origin clinical use authorization."

2357,Patients with history of covid-19 had more side effects after the first dose of covid-19 vaccine.,"Introduction: COVID-19 vaccination seems to be the most pertinent pharmacologic public health measure to control the pandemic. Reactogenicity symptoms were frequent in vaccine recipients mostly mild to moderate and commonly reported after the second dose. However, there is a lack of data in patients with a previous diagnosis of Covid-19. Methods: We analysed side effects of 311 patients after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, in a french university hospital. We compared patients with COVID-19 history to naive individuals. All the data collected are based on self-reported, including COVID-19 exposure status. Results: Overall, 229 (74%) patients reported at least one side effect. Among participants with history of Covid-19, 95% reported at least one adverse event versus 70% in naive patients (p < 0.01). However, symptom intensity was not different between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Vaccine recipients with prior COVID-19 reported more, but no more serious, side effects than naive participants."
2358,Tongue ulcer in a patient with COVID-19: a case presentation.,"Background: The emergence of COVID-19 has devastated many parts of the world. From asymptomatic to symptomatic, the virus causes a wide spectrum of presentations. COVID-19 patients may present with oral manifestations. In Afghanistan, where COVID-19 has severely strained the health care system, much of the population lacks proper oral hygiene. This makes the oral cavity a perfect site for SARS-CoV-2 to manifest clinical signs. Case presentation: A 62-year-old male was evaluated in the Dentistry Teaching Clinic of Kabul University of Medical Sciences for a painful erosive lesion on dorsal surface of his tongue. He also complained of fever, cough, and taste alteration. He was referred to Afghan Japan Hospital for COVID-19 testing and tested positive. He was followed on for the treatment of SARS-CoV2. After 2 weeks, the patient tested negative and returned to the dentistry clinic for follow-up. Although there were no other signs of COVID-19, the painful erosive lesion on his tongue persisted. Oral evaluation were performed and the patient was advised to practice good hygiene. After 10 days, we observed an asymptomatic geographic tongue without fever and myalgias and the lesion of dorsal surface of tongue improved from severe condition to moderate. Conclusion: In conclusion, patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 should be screened for symptoms and physical findings in the oral mucosa To prevent such an outcome, awareness programs need to be implemented for the diagnosis and management of clinical symptoms among patients."
2359,A Closer Look into FDA-EUA Approved Diagnostic Techniques of Covid-19.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, caused a worldwide pandemic in 2020 and is the most urgent health issue worldwide. In this review, we highlight the details of Food and Drug Administration-Emergency Use Authorizations approved diagnostics kits, focusing on the similarities and differences. It is essential to understand the currently available options and the advantages and disadvantages each provides to select the appropriate products that maximize the testing efficiency. We believe this work will provide a holistic evaluation of the current COVID-19 diagnostic resources, including variations across the countries, and guide developing novel diagnostic techniques to improve and optimize the current testing options."
