6010,Bondi and beyond. Lessons from three waves of COVID-19 from 2020.,"Objectives: To describe local operational aspects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) response during the first three waves of outbreaks in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, which began in January, July and December 2020. Type of program or service: Public health outbreak response. Methods: Narrative with epidemiological linking and genomic testing. Results: Epidemiological linking and genomic testing found that during the first wave of COVID-19 in NSW, a large number of community transmissions went undetected because of limited testing for the virus and limited contact tracing of cases. The second wave of COVID-19 in NSW emerged following reintroduction from the second wave in Victoria, Australia in July 2020, and the third wave followed undetected introduction from overseas. By the second and third waves, cases could be more effectively detected and isolated through an increased ability to test and contact trace, and to rapidly genomic sequence severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates, allowing most cases to be identified and epidemiologically linked. This greater certainty in understanding chains of transmission resulted in control of the outbreaks despite less stringent restrictions on the community, by using a refined strategy of targeted shutdown, restrictions on cases, their close contacts, identified hotspots and venues of concern rather than a whole of community lockdown. Risk assessments of potential transmission sites were constantly updated through our evolving experience with transmission events. However, this refined strategy did leave the potential for large point source outbreaks should any cases go undetected. [Addendum] A fourth wave that began in Sydney in June 2021 challenged this strategy due to the more transmissible nature of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Lessons learnt: A wave of COVID-19 infections can develop quickly from one infected person. The community needs to remain vigilant, adhering to physical distancing measures, signing in to venues they visit, and getting tested if they have any symptoms. Signing out of venues on exit allows public health resources to be used more efficiently to respond to outbreaks."

6012,Induction of Humoral and Cellular Immunity by Intradermal Delivery of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Using Dissolvable Microneedles.,The nucleocapsid protein (NP) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contains immunogenic epitopes that can induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) against viral infection. This makes the nucleocapsid protein a suitable candidate for developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This article reports the intradermal delivery of NP antigen using dissolvable microneedle skin patches that could induce both significant B cell and T cell responses.

6015,"Sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood donors during the third wave of infection in Norway, winter/spring 2021.","Cross-sectional studies of the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 in representative groups are routinely used for surveillance of public health in Norway. The group of blood donors is easily accessible to provide an estimate over the infection prevalence. Repeated testing of returning donors also generates data about the duration of the antibody response following infection and vaccination. The aim of the current study was to provide updated information about the development of the pandemic in the blood donor population, and to estimate the number of asymptomatic donors visiting the blood center, in an effort to evaluate the measures to prevent virus spreading between donors and staff. In the two main blood banks in the Oslo area, all blood donors were offered antibody testing for a period of three months. Almost 12,000 donors were tested, and the mean weekly prevalence of antibody positive donors due to infection was 2.7 % (varied from 2.1 to 4.0 %). The number of donors presenting following vaccination was 810 (6.9 %). An average of 38 % of the infections had been asymptomatic, and 31 % of the antibody-positive donors were unaware of having been infected. In conclusion, the proportion of blood donors seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 in our blood centers was stable whereas the number of vaccinated blood donors rapidly increased. This indicates that the virus spreading in the third wave of infection in the Oslo area mainly happened in groups underrepresented as blood donors. Health care workers prioritized for early vaccination may be overrepresented in the study period."
6016,"Systemic IL-15, IFN-gamma, and IP-10/CXCL10 signature associated with effective immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine recipients.","Early responses to vaccination are important for shaping both humoral and cellular protective immunity. Dissecting innate vaccine signatures may predict immunogenicity to help optimize the efficacy of mRNA and other vaccine strategies. Here, we characterize the cytokine and chemokine responses to the 1st and 2nd dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer/BioNtech) vaccine in antigen-naive and in previously coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected individuals (NCT04743388). Transient increases in interleukin-15 (IL-15) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels early after boost correlate with Spike antibody levels, supporting their use as biomarkers of effective humoral immunity development in response to vaccination. We identify a systemic signature including increases in IL-15, IFN-γ, and IP-10/CXCL10 after the 1st vaccination, which were enriched by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-6 after the 2nd vaccination. In previously COVID-19-infected individuals, a single vaccination results in both strong cytokine induction and antibody titers similar to the ones observed upon booster vaccination in antigen-naive individuals, a result with potential implication for future public health recommendations."
6017,SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: IgA correlates with severity of disease in early COVID-19 infection.,"Timing of detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and their use to support the diagnosis are of increasing interest. We used the Gold Standard Diagnostics ELISA to evaluate the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies in sera of 82 hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Serum samples were collected 1-59 days post-onset of symptoms (PoS) and we examined the association of age, sex, disease severity, and symptoms' duration with antibody levels. We also tested sera of 100 ambulatory hospital employees with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and samples collected during convalescence, 35-57 days PoS. All but four of the admitted patients (95.1%) developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies were detected within 7 days PoS; IgA in 60.0%, IgM in 53.3%, and IgG in 46.7% of samples. IgG positivity increased to 100% on Day 21. We did not observe significant differences in the rate of antibody development in regard to age and sex. IgA levels were highest in patients with a severe and critical illness. In multiple regression analyses, only IgA levels were statistically significantly correlated with critical disease (p = .05) regardless of age, sex, and duration of symptoms. Among 100 ambulatory hospital employees who had antibody testing after 4 weeks PoS only 10% had positive IgA antibodies. The most frequently isolated isotype in sera of employees after 30 days PoS was IgG (88%). IgA was the predominant immunoglobulin in early disease and correlated independently with a critical illness. IgG antibodies remained detectable in almost 90% of samples collected up to two months after infection."
6018,Associations of BNT162b2 vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospital admission and death with covid-19 in nursing homes and healthcare workers in Catalonia: prospective cohort study.,"Objective: To determine associations of BNT162b2 vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospital admission and death with covid-19 among nursing home residents, nursing home staff, and healthcare workers. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Nursing homes and linked electronic medical record, test, and mortality data in Catalonia on 27 December 2020. Participants: 28 456 nursing home residents, 26 170 nursing home staff, and 61 791 healthcare workers. Main outcome measures: Participants were followed until the earliest outcome (confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission or death with covid-19) or 26 May 2021. Vaccination status was introduced as a time varying exposure, with a 14 day run-in after the first dose. Mixed effects Cox models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios with index month as a fixed effect and adjusted for confounders including sociodemographics, comorbidity, and previous medicine use. Results: Among the nursing home residents, SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in 2482, 411 were admitted to hospital with covid-19, and 450 died with covid-19 during the study period. In parallel, 1828 nursing home staff and 2968 healthcare workers were found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, but fewer than five were admitted or died with covid-19. The adjusted hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection after two doses of vaccine was 0.09 (95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.11) for nursing home residents, 0.20 (0.17 to 0.24) for nursing home staff, and 0.13 (0.11 to 0.16) for healthcare workers. Adjusted hazard ratios for hospital admission and mortality after two doses of vaccine were 0.05 (0.04 to 0.07) and 0.03 (0.02 to 0.04), respectively, for nursing home residents. Nursing home staff and healthcare workers recorded insufficient events for mortality analysis. Conclusions: Vaccination was associated with 80-91% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection in all three cohorts and greater reductions in hospital admissions and mortality among nursing home residents for up to five months. More data are needed on longer term effects of covid-19 vaccines."
6019,[COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory state in a 15-year-old female patient].,"Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Temporally Related to SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is a rare novel clinical entity observed in children and adolescents with evidence of a recent COVID-19 infection, and is characterized by a marked hyperinflammatory state with involvement of multiple organ systems.We report a case of a previously healthy 15-year-old female patient, who was admitted to paediatric intensive care with cardiac failure and was subsequently shown to have positive COVID-19 serology. The presenting symptoms were fever, cough, chest pain and gastro-intestinal symptoms. She was supported with milrinone and a low dose of vasopressors. Her hyperinflammatory state was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins, high dose aspirin and high-dose methylprednisolone. PIMS-TS is a rare, potentially life threatening novel clinical entity in children and adolescents with evidence of a COVID-19 infection. Clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of this new disease, to ensure prompt recognition and treatment."
