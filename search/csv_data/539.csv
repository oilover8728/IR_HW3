5380,Rapid realist review of the role of community pharmacy in the public health response to COVID-19.,"Introduction: Community pharmacists and their teams have remained accessible to the public providing essential services despite immense pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have successfully expanded the influenza vaccination programme and are now supporting the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out. Aim: This rapid realist review aims to understand how community pharmacy can most effectively deliver essential and advanced services, with a focus on vaccination, during the pandemic and in the future. Method: An embryonic programme theory was generated using four diverse and complementary documents along with the expertise of the project team. Academic databases, preprint services and grey literature were searched and screened for documents meeting our inclusion criteria. The data were extracted from 103 documents to develop and refine a programme theory using a realist logic of analysis. Our analysis generated 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining when, why and how community pharmacy can support public health vaccination campaigns, maintain essential services during pandemics and capitalise on opportunities for expanded, sustainable public health service roles. The views of stakeholders including pharmacy users, pharmacists, pharmacy teams and other healthcare professionals were sought throughout to refine the 13 explanatory configurations. Results: The 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations are organised according to decision makers, community pharmacy teams and community pharmacy users as key actors. Review findings include: supporting a clear role for community pharmacies in public health; clarifying pharmacists' legal and professional liabilities; involving pharmacy teams in service specification design; providing suitable guidance, adequate compensation and resources; and leveraging accessible, convenient locations of community pharmacy. Discussion: Community pharmacy has been able to offer key services during the pandemic. Decision makers must endorse, articulate and support a clear public health role for community pharmacy. We provide key recommendations for decision makers to optimise such a role during these unprecedented times and in the future."
5381,Interpretive discrepancies caused by target values inter-batch variations in chemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG by MAGLUMI.,"Plasma specimens from coronavirus disease 2019 patients were double-tested for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies by two different batches of MAGLUMI 2019-nCov immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G (IgM/IgG) assays to evaluate IgM/IgG levels, qualitative interpretation, antibody kinetics, and linearity of diluted specimen. Here we show that (i) high-level IgM specimens need to be diluted with negative human plasma but not kit diluents and (ii) measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG concentrations are substantially higher with later marketed immunoassay batch leading to (iii) the change of qualitative interpretation (positive vs. negative) in 12.3% of specimens measured for IgM, (iv) the informative time-course pattern of antibody production only when data from different immunoassay batches are not combined."
5382,Passive immunization: Paradoxical and traditional method for new pandemic challenge COVID-19.,"World has been suffering from pandemic caused by mysterious Coronavirus. The novel member of Coronaviridae causing COVID-19 disease is named as SARS-Cov-2. Its first case was reported in China by the end of 2019, but its exponential spread has wrapped entire globe, suspended and is penalizing mankind. A retrospective meta-analysis study showed that outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS-Cov-1 (Coronaviridae), influenza infection H1N1 and West-African Ebola caused lower mortality than this new pandemic COVID-19. Virus has appeared as a new human pathogen so to counter COVID-19 no specific vaccine, monoclonal antibodies have been manufactured till day. The outbreak of novel Coronavirus is treated with antimicrobial drugs but they have their own mild side effects. But the drastic spread of COVID-19 compels us also to use other ways to counter pandemic. Thus, passive immunization can be opted to hold back this mysterious virus. Passive immunization has been in use since early 20th century and showed its effectiveness against all previous infectious outbreaks including MERS and SARS-Cov-1 members of Coronaviridae. The review argues that convalescent plasma is an explicit option for containment of COVID-19 disease."
5383,What are the measures taken to prevent COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers? A retrospective study in a cluster of primary care clinics in Singapore.,"Objective: To examine factors contributing to the low COVID-19 infectivity rate among healthcare workers in SingHealth Polyclinics (SHP), Singapore, from February to July 2020. Design: Retrospective description, analysis and discussion of the factors and their contribution. Setting: Single-institution study. Methods: We describe and discuss the healthcare policies, infrastructure, people and processes contributing to the low COVID-19 infectivity rate in SHP.There were 1212 full-time and 198 contract staff. Of these, 171 SHP employees also supported the work in dormitories, isolation and community care facilities. During the review period, healthcare workers (HCWs) in SHP managed about 867 076 patient attendances, including 63 503 for upper respiratory tract infections, across its cluster of eight polyclinics. 29 642 swabs for COVID-19 were performed in SHP, with 126 positive results. 395 swabs were carried out in the dormitories and 59 were positive. Despite the high exposure, only two SHP staff were infected with COVID-19. Both have recovered well. Results: Provision of adequate personal protection equipment, zonal segregation of high-risk patients, reduction in physical patient visits, effective staff communication, implementation of self-declared temperature monitoring and the maintenance of sustainable workload and work hours of HCWs contributed to the mitigation of COVID-19 infection risk among our staff. Conclusions: Until the widespread uptake of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19, these measures are important in protecting HCWs. They are also important when managing future pandemics of similar nature to COVID-19."
5384,Post-Traumatic Growth Experiences among COVID-19 Confirmed Cases in China: A Qualitative Study.,"COVID-19 infection can cause psychological distress and profoundly impact patients' lives, but it can also lead to positive changes and post-traumatic growth (PTG), or positive psychological change in response to challenging life circumstances. Current research on the influence of COVID-19 infection has mainly focused on its negative effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with COVID-19 in China experienced PTG and, if so, what changed for them during the process of PTG. We used a qualitative descriptive approach to conduct this study. Using the purposive sampling recruitment method, patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were recruited from a COVID-19 designated hospital in Shanghai, China, from April to July 2020. Data were collected using semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted via cell phone or in person while social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Forty confirmed COVID-19 patients (19-68 years old) were recruited. Several prominent themes and subthemes were extracted from the interview responses regarding participants' experiences of PTG. The following are among the positive changesthat occurred for these participants after their diagnosis of COVID-19: (1) Reevaluation of their life priorities, which included a greater appreciation of being alive and re-evaluating their values and goals, (2) Improved relationships within their social circles, which included establishing or maintaining closer relationships with family and friends and a greater willingness to help others, and (3) Perceived changes regarding themselves, which included personal growth and increased awareness of the importance of their health. The study identified potential positive impacts of COVID-19 on patients, which could be helpful in the implementation of interventions to facilitate PTG among COVID-19 survivors."
5385,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in blood donors from the Lodi Red Zone and adjacent Lodi metropolitan and suburban area.,"Objectives: To define the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in blood donors (referred to the first lockdown area (Lodi Red-Zone) of the Lombardy region and in a contiguous area that was not included in the first lockdown); to define the agreement between a commercial serological assay and a reference microneutralization assay; and to evaluate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in a cohort of blood donors. Methods: Blood donors referred to the first lockdown area in Lombardy Region and the neighbouring area were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG-specific antibodies during the period 18 March to 24 June 2020. Serum samples were analysed using both a chemiluminescent immunoassay (LIAISONÂ® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, DiaSorin) for the quantitative characterization of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgG antibodies and a neutralizing antibodies (NT-Abs) assay. Results: In the period from 18 March to 24 June, 1922 blood donors were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG showing a prevalence of 378/1922 (19.7%). A subgroup of 1139 blood donors were tested in parallel with a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and a microneutralization assay showing a prevalence of 22.2% and 21.6%, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgG quantification was correlated with NT-Abs titres. In 78.2% of participants the NT-Abs titre was maintained, but in 15.8% it decreased by one four-fold dilution and in 6.0% it increased by one four-fold dilution. Conclusions: The duration of immunity of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the course of the pandemic and for this reason the monitoring of NT Abs is important. Despite a stable NT-Abs titre being observed in the majority of blood donors, our findings need to be validated in a long-term period of follow up."

5387,"Within-country age-based prioritisation, global allocation, and public health impact of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: A mathematical modelling analysis.","The worldwide endeavour to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has been extraordinary, and vaccination is now underway in many countries. However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extend a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identify optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We find that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for < 20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning."
5388,Diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement of CO-RADS: evaluation of classification in radiology practice.,"Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the use of the COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) among radiologists and the diagnostic performance of this system. Methods: Four radiologists retrospectively evaluated the chest CT examinations of 178 patients. The study included 143 patients with positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results and 35 patients whose RT-PCR tests were negative but whose clinical and/or radiological findings were consistent with COVID-19. Fleiss' kappa (Îº) values were calculated, and individual observers' scores were compared. To investigate diagnostic efficiency, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for each interpreter. Results: The interpreters were in full agreement on 574 of 712 (80.6%) evaluations. The common Fleiss' Îº value of all the radiologists combined was 0.712 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.692-0.769). A reliable prediction on the basis of RT-PCR and clinical findings indicated the mean area under the curve (AUC) of Fleiss' Îº value as 0.89 (95% CI 0.708-0.990). General interpreter agreement was found to range from moderate to good. Conclusion: The interpreter agreement for CO-RADS categories 1 and 5 was reasonably good. We conclude that this scoring system will make a valuable contribution to efforts in COVID-19 diagnosis. CO-RADS can also be of significant value for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease in cases with false-negative PCR results."
5389,COVID-19 experience of the major pandemic response center in the capital: results of the pandemic's first month in Turkey.,"Background/aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and parameters that determined the clinical course and prognosis of the COVID-19 patients admitted to Ankara City Hospital during the first month of the pandemic in Turkey. Materials and methods: SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients who were hospitalized between March 10 and April 10, 2020 were included. Results: Among 222 patients, mean age was higher in severe acute respiratory illness (SARI)/critical disease group (P < 0.001). Median time from illness onset to admission and presence of comorbidity, especially coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were significantly higher in the SARI/critical disease group (P < 0.05). Cough and fever were the most common symptoms, while anosmia and loss of taste were observed in 8.6% and 7.7% patients, respectively. The mortality rate was 5.4%. A high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio; low lymphocyte, monocyte, and platelet count; elevated liver enzymes; low GFR; and high levels of muscle enzymes, ferritin, and IL-6 on admission were found to be associated with SARI/critical disease (P < 0.05). Bilateral ground-glass opacity and patchy infiltration were more frequently seen in the SARI/critical disease group (P < 0.001). Patients older than 65 years had an 8-fold increased risk for development of SARI/critical disease. Conclusion: This cohort study regarding COVID-19 cases in Turkey reveals that older age, presence of comorbidity, bilateral infiltration on CT, high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, low monocyte and platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, low GFR, high levels of muscle enzymes, and high levels of ferritin and IL-6 on admission are predictors of SARI and severe disease."
