7610,Phylogenetic pattern of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients from Bosnia and Herzegovina: lessons learned to optimize future molecular and epidemiological approaches.,"This is the first report of molecular and epidemiology findings from Bosnia and Herzegovina related to ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic. Whole genome sequence of four samples from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks was done in two laboratories in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Veterinary Faculty Sarajevo and Alea Genetic Center). All four BiH sequences cluster mainly with European ones (Italy, Austria, France, Sweden, Cyprus, and England). The constructed phylogenetic tree indicates possible multiple independent introduction events. The data presented contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 in the current reemergence of the disease."

7612,"The journey of SARS-CoV-2 in human hosts: a review of immune responses, immunosuppression, and their consequences.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory findings from a significant number of patients with COVID-19 indicate the occurrence of leukocytopenia, specifically lymphocytopenia. Moreover, infected patients can experience contrasting outcomes depending on lymphocytopenia status. Patients with resolved lymphocytopenia are more likely to recover, whereas critically ill patients with signs of unresolved lymphocytopenia develop severe complications, sometimes culminating in death. Why immunodepression manifests in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. Therefore, the evaluation of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings from infected patients is critical for understanding the disease course and its consequences. In this review, we take a logical approach to unravel the reasons for immunodepression in patients with COVID-19. Following the footprints of the virus within host tissues, from entry to exit, we extrapolate the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of immunodepression."
7613,"Are We Paving the Way to Dig Out of the ""Pandemic Hole""? A Narrative Review on SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination: From Animal Models to Human Immunization.","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new pathogen agent causing the coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19). This novel virus originated the most challenging pandemic in this century, causing economic and social upheaval internationally. The extreme infectiousness and high mortality rates incentivized the development of vaccines to control this pandemic to prevent further morbidity and mortality. This international scenario led academic scientists, industries, and governments to work and collaborate strongly to make a portfolio of vaccines available at an unprecedented pace. Indeed, the robust collaboration between public systems and private companies led to resolutive actions for accelerating therapeutic interventions and vaccines mechanism. These strategies contributed to rapidly identifying safe and effective vaccines as quickly and efficiently as possible. Preclinical research employed animal models to develop vaccines that induce protective and long-lived immune responses. A spectrum of vaccines is worldwide under investigation in various preclinical and clinical studies to develop both individual protection and safe development of population-level herd immunity. Companies employed and developed different technological approaches for vaccines production, including inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated, non-replicating viral vector vaccines, as well as acid nucleic-based vaccines. In this view, the present narrative review provides an overview of current vaccination strategies, taking into account both preclinical studies and clinical trials in humans. Furthermore, to better understand immunization, animal models on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are also briefly discussed."
7614,[The mechanism and treatment strategies of SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammatory response].,"Since the emergence of novel coronavirus pneumonia in late 2019, it has quickly spread to many countries and regions around the world, causing a significant impact on human beings and society, posing a great threat to the global public health system. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was highly infectious, and some complications emerged rapidly in some patients, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ failure. The virus could trigger a series of immune responses, which might lead to excessive immune activation, thereby bringing about the immune system imbalance of the body. Up to now, there was no specific antiviral drug, and we conjectured that immunomodulatory therapy might play an essential part in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as adjuvant therapy. Therefore, we analyzed the possible mechanism of immune imbalance caused by the new coronavirus, and summarized the immunotherapeutic means of COVID-19 based on the mechanisms, to provide some reference for follow-up research and clinical prevention and treatment of COVID-19."
7615,SARS-CoV-2 3D database: understanding the coronavirus proteome and evaluating possible drug targets.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly growing infectious disease, widely spread with high mortality rates. Since the release of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence in March 2020, there has been an international focus on developing target-based drug discovery, which also requires knowledge of the 3D structure of the proteome. Where there are no experimentally solved structures, our group has created 3D models with coverage of 97.5% and characterized them using state-of-the-art computational approaches. Models of protomers and oligomers, together with predictions of substrate and allosteric binding sites, protein-ligand docking, SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions with human proteins, impacts of mutations, and mapped solved experimental structures are freely available for download. These are implemented in SARS CoV-2 3D, a comprehensive and user-friendly database, available at https://sars3d.com/. This provides essential information for drug discovery, both to evaluate targets and design new potential therapeutics."
7616,An engineered CRISPR-Cas12a variant and DNA-RNA hybrid guides enable robust and rapid COVID-19 testing.,"Extensive testing is essential to break the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we present a CRISPR-based diagnostic assay that is robust to viral genome mutations and temperature, produces results fast, can be applied directly on nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens without RNA purification, and incorporates a human internal control within the same reaction. Specifically, we show that the use of an engineered AsCas12a enzyme enables detection of wildtype and mutated SARS-CoV-2 and allows us to perform the detection step with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) at 60-65 Â°C. We also find that the use of hybrid DNA-RNA guides increases the rate of reaction, enabling our test to be completed within 30 minutes. Utilizing clinical samples from 72 patients with COVID-19 infection and 57 healthy individuals, we demonstrate that our test exhibits a specificity and positive predictive value of 100% with a sensitivity of 50 and 1000 copies per reaction (or 2 and 40 copies per microliter) for purified RNA samples and unpurified NP specimens respectively."

7618,"SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in urine, blood, anal swabs, and oropharyngeal swabs specimens.","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA) in urine and blood specimens, and anal and oropharyngeal swabs from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and correlated positive results with clinical findings. Methods: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were included in this study. Patients' demographic and clinical data were recorded. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine and blood specimens, and anal and oropharyngeal swabs. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT04279782, 19 February, 2020). Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in all four specimen types, though not all specimen types were positive simultaneously. The presence of viral RNA was not necessarily predictive of clinical symptoms, for example, the presence of viral RNA in the urine did not necessarily predict urinary tract symptoms. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 can infect multiple systems, including the urinary tract. Testing different specimen types may be useful for monitoring disease changes and progression, and for establishing a prognosis."
7619,COVID-19 and renin-angiotensin system modulators: what do we know so far?,"Introduction: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory system-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an important medical problem worldwide. Increased risk of mortality has been reported in patients with cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension (HTN). SARS-CoV-2 invades the pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells by binding to the surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) modulators can increase levels of ACE2. Thus, concerns have been raised regarding an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection in patients receiving RAS antagonists. Areas covered: We reviewed current literature about the potential association between the utilization of RAS inhibitors, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and likelihood of developing severe COVID-19 infection and whether or not continuation of these medications is appropriate in patients with active disease. Expert opinion: The joint statement from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), strongly recommends that physicians should not initiate or withdraw their usual RAS-related treatments (ACE-inhibitor/ARB) to COVID-19 infected patients with cardiovascular disease. The decision should be made based upon each patient's clinical presentation and hemodynamic status."
