6671,Action Levels for SARS-CoV-2 in Air: Preliminary Approach.,"Quantitative microbial risk assessment has been used to develop criteria for exposure to many microorganisms. In this article, the dose-response curve for Coronavirus 229E is used to develop preliminary risk-based exposure criteria for SARS-CoV-2 via the respiratory portals of entry."
6672,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia incidentally detected on coronary CT angiogram: a do-not-miss diagnosis.,"Coronary CT angiograms are commonly performed for the evaluation of coronary artery disease and coronary arterial anatomy. However, extracardiac findings are frequently detected on these examinations and often can explain patients' underlying symptoms, having a significant impact on patient management. Here in, we discuss three cases of incidentally detected novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia (NCIP). This case series highlights the image findings in NCIP and emphasizes the importance of evaluating all organs in the field of view on coronary CT angiograms. In addition, with the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 and exponentially increasing incidence throughout the world, this report stresses the need for including NCIP in the differential diagnosis of patients with typical image findings in at-risk populations, as early diagnosis is crucial for appropriate patient management and post-exposure recommendations."
6673,Conventional and Unconventional Approaches for Innovative Drug Treatments in COVID-19: Looking Outside of Plato's Cave.,"Thousands of drugs and nutraceuticals along with their combinations can be used to select candidate therapeutics for targeting the transmission, proliferation and the fatal or severe symptoms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in order to reduce the unacceptably high mortality rate observed in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its associated negative effects on daily life worldwide [...]."
6674,Benchmarking the Covid-19 pandemic across countries and states in the USA under heterogeneous testing.,"Scientists and policymakers need to compare the incidence of Covid-19 across territories or periods with various levels of testing. Benchmarking based on the increase in total cases or case fatality rates is one way of comparing the evolution of the pandemic across countries or territories and could inform policy decisions about strategies to control coronavirus transmission. However, comparing cases and fatality rates across regions is challenging due to heterogeneity in testing and health systems. We show two complementary ways of benchmarking across territories and in time. First, we used multivariate regressions to estimate the test-elasticity of Covid-19 case incidence. Cases grow less than proportionally with testing when assessing weekly changes or looking across states in the USA. They tend to be proportional or even more than proportional when comparing the month-to-month evolution of an average country in the pandemic. Our results were robust to various model specifications. Second, we decomposed the growth in cases into test growth and positive test ratio growth to intuitively visualize the components of case growth. We hope these results can help support evidence-based decisions by public officials and help the public discussion when comparing across territories and in time."
6675,Passing the Test: A Model-Based Analysis of Safe School-Reopening Strategies.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has induced historic educational disruptions. In April 2021, about 40% of U.S. public school students were not offered full-time in-person education. Objective: To assess the risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. Design: An agent-based network model was developed to simulate transmission in elementary and high school communities, including home, school, and interhousehold interactions. Setting: School structure was parametrized to reflect average U.S. classrooms, with elementary schools of 638 students and high schools of 1451 students. Daily local incidence was varied from 1 to 100 cases per 100 000 persons. Participants: Students, faculty, staff, and adult household members. Intervention: Isolation of symptomatic individuals, quarantine of an infected individual's contacts, reduced class sizes, alternative schedules, staff vaccination, and weekly asymptomatic screening. Measurements: Transmission was projected among students, staff, and families after a single infection in school and over an 8-week quarter, contingent on local incidence. Results: School transmission varies according to student age and local incidence and is substantially reduced with mitigation measures. Nevertheless, when transmission occurs, it may be difficult to detect without regular testing because of the subclinical nature of most children's infections. Teacher vaccination can reduce transmission to staff, and asymptomatic screening improves understanding of local circumstances and reduces transmission. Limitation: Uncertainty exists about the susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and precision is low regarding the effectiveness of specific countermeasures, particularly with new variants. Conclusion: With controlled community transmission and moderate mitigation, elementary schools can open safety, but high schools require more intensive mitigation. Asymptomatic screening can facilitate reopening at higher local incidence while minimizing transmission risk. Primary funding source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Facebook."
6676,"Positive Rate of Serology and RT-PCR for COVID-19 among Community Residents and Healthcare Workers in Wuhan, China.","This study aimed to evaluate the infection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among different populations in Wuhan, China. This cross-sectional survey-based study examined the results of SARS-CoV-2-specific serological tests and RT-PCR tests for 4,454 community residents and 4,614 healthcare workers performed from May 15 to May 29, 2020. The healthcare workers were classified as administrative and logistical staff (n = 1,378), non-first-line healthcare workers (n = 2,630), or first-line healthcare workers (n = 606) according to their frequency of contact with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and RNA were 2.9%, 0.4%, and 0.1% for the community residents and 3.3%, 0.6%, and 0.2% for the healthcare workers, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the rates of the two groups. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the frequency of contact with COVID-19 patients negatively correlated with the positive rates of RT-PCR (rs = -0.036, P = 0.016), but did not significantly correlate with the positive rates of IgM (rs = -0.006, P = 0.698) or IgG (rs = 0.017, P = 0.239). There was no statistically significant difference between the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, or RNA positive rates of the community residents and those of the healthcare workers. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was lower for the first-line healthcare workers than for the non-first-line healthcare workers and the administrative and logistical staff."
6677,Hunting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (2019 novel coronavirus): From laboratory testing back to basic research.,"The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in many countries causes citizens of daily inconvenience and even life-threat for elderly population. The invasion of the main pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), into human body causes different levels of impact to various patients. One of the most important issues for COVID-19 is how to defend this virus with the ability to foresee the infected targets. Thus, we maintain the quarantined essentially as for as others saved from COVID-19. So far, the routine laboratory test to confirm whether infected by SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV or not is through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR; quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]) with certain sequence regions that recognize SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV RNA genome. The heavy loading of rRT-PCR (qPCR) machine and handling labor have tight-packed the instruments as well as the manpower almost in every country. Therefore, the alternative approaches are eagerly waiting to be developed. In this review article, we sort out some state-of-the-art novel approaches that might be applied for a fast, sensitive, and precise detection of SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV not only to help the routine laboratory testing but also to improve effective quarantine."
6678,Inhibition of S-protein RBD and hACE2 Interaction for Control of SARSCoV- 2 Infection (COVID-19).,"Background: COVID-19 has become a pandemic with higher morbidity and mortality rates after its start from Wuhan city of China. The infection by RNA virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV, from the beta class of coronaviruses, has been found to be responsible for COVID-19. Structural analysis and evidences have been indicated that interaction between a segment of receptor binding domain (RBD) from S protein of the virus and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is essential for cellular entry of the virus. Objective: The current review sheds light on structural aspects for the inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction mediated cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The present study provides a critical review of recently published information on RBDhACE2 interaction and its inhibitors to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review highlighted the structural aspects of the interaction between RBD-hACE2 and involved amino acid residues. Results: Recently, several studies are being conducted for the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry to the human cellular system. One of the important targets for viral invasion is its binding with cell surface receptor, hACE2, through RBD on S-protein. Mimicking of three residues on ACE2 (Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain) provided a hot target directed strategy for the inhibition of early attachment of the virus to the cell. Early screening of peptidic or non-peptidic molecules for the inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction has raised the hope for potential therapeutics against COVID-19. The higher affinity of molecules toward RBD than ACE2 is an important factor for selectivity and minimization of ACE2 related adverse events on the cardiovascular system, brain, kidney, and foetus development during pregnancy. Conclusion: Inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction by different molecular scaffolds can be used as a preferred strategy for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, published reports pointed out Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on the B chain of ACE2 as crucial residues for mimicking and design of novel molecules as inhibitors SARS-CoV-2 attachment to human cells. Moreover, some recently identified RBD-hACE2 interaction inhibitors have also been described with their protein binding pattern and potencies (IC50 values), which will help for further improvement in the selectivity."
6679,BNT162b2 vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies and poly-specific T cells in humans.,"BNT162b2, a nucleoside-modified mRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) stabilized in its prefusion conformation, has demonstrated 95% efficacy in preventing COVID-191. Here we extend a previous phase-I/II trial report2 by presenting data on the immune response induced by BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination from an additional phase-I/II trial in healthy adults (18-55 years old). BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses: at one week after the boost, SARS-CoV-2 serum geometric mean 50% neutralizing titres were up to 3.3-fold above those observed in samples from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Sera elicited by BNT162b2 neutralized 22 pseudoviruses bearing the S of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Most participants had a strong response of IFNγ+ or IL-2+ CD8+ and CD4+ T helper type 1 cells, which was detectable throughout the full observation period of nine weeks following the boost. Using peptide-MHC multimer technology, we identified several BNT162b2-induced epitopes that were presented by frequent MHC alleles and conserved in mutant strains. One week after the boost, epitope-specific CD8+ T cells of the early-differentiated effector-memory phenotype comprised 0.02-2.92% of total circulating CD8+ T cells and were detectable (0.01-0.28%) eight weeks later. In summary, BNT162b2 elicits an adaptive humoral and poly-specific cellular immune response against epitopes that are conserved in a broad range of variants, at well-tolerated doses."
