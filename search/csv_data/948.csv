9470,Whole-genome Sequencing to Track Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Transmission in Nosocomial Outbreaks.,"Background: During the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare institutions posed a significant problem. Due to limited evidence, guidance on appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures such as the wearing of face masks varied. Here, we applied whole virus genome sequencing (WvGS) to analyze transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-acquired (HA) COVID-19. Methods: An investigation was undertaken for all HA cases of COVID-19 from March to April 2020. Fifty SARS-CoV-2 samples were analysed by WvGS and their phylogenetic relationship established. Results: WvGS identified transmission events previously undetected by epidemiological analysis and provided evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between healthcare workers (HCW) and patients and among HCW themselves. The majority of HA COVID-19 cases occurred in patients highly dependent on nursing care, suggesting the likely route of transmission was by close contact or droplet, rather than aerosol, transmission. Mortality among HA COVID-19 infections was recorded as 33%. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs to patients. Interventions including comprehensive screening of HCWs for COVID-19 symptoms, PCR testing of asymptomatic HCWs upon identification of HA cases and implementation of universal use of surgical masks for all clinical care is indicated to prevent viral transmission. Our study highlights the importance of close collaboration between guidance bodies and frontline IPC experts for developing control measures in an emergency pandemic situation caused by a virus with undefined transmission modus."
9471,Risk of COVID-19 and major adverse clinical outcomes among people with disabilities in South Korea.,"Background: Evidence regarding the risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the major adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 among people with disabilities (PwDs) is scarce. Objective: This study investigated the association of disability status with the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test positivity and the risk of major adverse clinical outcomes among participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This study included all patients (n = 8070) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and individuals without COVID-19 (n = 121,050) in South Korea from January 1 to May 30, 2020. The study variables included officially registered disability status from the government, SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, and major adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death). Results: The study participants included 129,120 individuals (including 7261 PwDs), of whom 8070 (6.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, PwDs had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity compared with people without disabilities (odds ratio [OR]: 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-1.48). Among participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, PwDs were associated with an increased risk of major adverse clinical outcomes from COVID-19 compared to those without disabilities (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.11-1.86). Conclusions: PwDs had an increased risk of COVID-19 and major adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 compared with people without disabilities. Given the higher vulnerability of PwDs to COVID-19, tailored policy and management to protect against the risk of COVID-19 are required."
9472,COVID-19 and Preparing for Future Ecological Crises: Hopes from Metagenomics in Facing Current and Future Viral Pandemic Challenges.,"The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak demonstrates the potential of coronaviruses, especially bat-derived beta coronaviruses to rapidly escalate to a global pandemic that has caused deaths in the order of several millions already. The huge efforts put in place by the scientific community to address this emergency have disclosed how the implementation of new technologies is crucial in the prepandemic period to timely face future ecological crises. In this context, we argue that metagenomics and new approaches to understanding ecosystems and biodiversity offer veritable prospects to innovate therapeutics and diagnostics against novel and existing infectious agents. We discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with the science of metagenomics, specifically with an eye to inform and prevent future ecological crises and pandemics that are looming on the horizon in the 21st century."
9473,[The preparedness of the Italian obstetric surveillance system in the response to the emergency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: methodological aspects of a population-based study].,"This paper aims to describe the Italian obstetric surveillance system (ItOSS) preparedness as an element for a timely response to the new Coronavirus pandemic. ItOSS is a surveillance network that has been collecting data on maternal mortality and conducting population studies on obstetric near misses since 2013. At the beginning of the pandemic, ItOSS launched a new population-based project to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and post-partum and promptly give back information useful to clinicians and decision-makers. All the regions and autonomous provinces, for a total of 289 birth units (PN), joined the study. Data relating to pregnant or post-partum women with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis addressing the maternities for outpatient visits or hospitalization were collected. The project methodology entails that each participating maternity reports the cases to ItOSS uploading data through an open-source platform. The on-line form includes sociodemographic and clinical data and maternal-neonatal outcomes. Biological samples to detect possible vertical transmission are also collected voluntarily. A total of 534 incident cases were reported from February 25th to July 10th 2020; 7 regions also collected biological samples for 227 cases; data collection is still ongoing.A preliminary analysis of the first 146 SARS-CoV-2 positive women who gave birth between February 25th to April 22nd shows an incidence rate of the infection equal to 2.1/1,000 in Italy and 6.9/1,000 in the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy). The brief time needed to setting up and operating the project, the national coverage, the adoption of shared tools for data collection, the quality and completeness of the information collected show how the availability of active networks like ItOSS represents a crucial element to hold a high level of preparedness in case of a health emergency."

9476,"SARS-CoV-2 in Nursing Homes after 3 Months of Serial, Facilitywide Point Prevalence Testing, Connecticut, USA.","Nursing homes house populations that are highly vulnerable to coronavirus disease. Point prevalence surveys (PPSs) provide information on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection status of staff and residents in nursing homes and enable isolation of infectious persons to halt disease spread. We collected 16 weeks of public health surveillance data on a subset of nursing homes (34/212) in Connecticut, USA. We fit a Poisson regression model to evaluate the association between incidence and time since serial PPS onset, adjusting for decreasing community incidence and other factors. Nursing homes conducted a combined total of 205 PPSs in staff and 232 PPSs in residents. PPS was associated with 41%-80% reduction in incidence rate in nursing homes. Our findings provide support for the use of repeated PPSs in nursing home staff and residents, combined with strong infection prevention measures such as cohorting, in contributing to outbreak control."
9477,Efficacy of human coronavirus immune convalescent plasma for the treatment of corona virus disease -19 disease in hospitalized children: A protocol for systematic review and meta analysis.,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral infection resulting in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease has recently been designated by the World Health Organization as a global pandemic. Some doctors are using convalescent plasma (CP) therapies to treat COVID-19 patients. However, whether CP therapy is effective for children with COVID-19 remains controversial. Therefore, this study further explores the effectiveness and safety of human coronavirus immune CP in the treatment of COVID-19 in children. Methods: Comprehensively search the electronic databases such as the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang, and collect relevant documents. We will also look for other sources. All document sources will not be restricted by language and publication status. Two researchers will independently conduct research selection, data extraction and research quality assessment. RevMan 5.3 was used for statistical analysis. Results: This study will provide high-quality comprehensive evidence for the effectiveness and safety of human coronavirus immuno CP in the treatment of COVID-19 in children CONCLUSIONS:: The results of this study will provide the basis for the effectiveness and safety of human coronavirus immuno CP treatment of COVID-19 in children.

9478,EULAR provisional recommendations for the management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in the context of SARS-CoV-2.,"The provisional EULAR recommendations address several aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus, and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 and are meant for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) and their caregivers. A task force of 20 members was convened by EULAR that met several times by videoconferencing in April 2020. The task force finally agreed on five overarching principles and 13 recommendations covering four generic themes: (1) General measures and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. (2) The management of RMD when local measures of social distancing are in effect. (3) The management of COVID-19 in the context of RMD. (4) The prevention of infections other than SARS-CoV-2. EULAR considers this set of recommendations as a 'living document' and a starting point, which will be updated as soon as promising new developments with potential impact on the care of patients with RMD become available."
9479,"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the follow-up and treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a cross-sectional, multicentre phone call survey.","Objective: To learn about the attitudes and behaviours of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in relation to the difficulties experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: A cross-sectional, multicentre phone call survey. Setting: Four university hospitals in Turkey. Participants: The study included patients with IPF receiving antifibrotics for at least 3 months and with doctor appointment and/or scheduled routine blood analysis between March and May 2020 (the first 3 months after the official announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey). Interventions: Phone calls (a 5 min interview) were performed in June 2020. A questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale were applied. Main outcome measures: Patients' preferences for disease monitoring, patients' attitudes and behaviours towards IPF, drug continuation, COVID-19 diagnosis and anxiety/depression status. Results: The study included 115 patients with IPF (82 male; mean age, 68.43±7.44 years). Of the patients, 73.9% had doctor appointment and 52.2% had scheduled routine blood testing; 54.5% of patients with doctor appointment self-cancelled their appointments and 53.3% of patients with scheduled routine blood testing did not undergo testing. Of the patients, 32.2% were on nintedanib and 67.8% were on pirfenidone; self-initiated drug discontinuation rate was 22.6%. The percentage of patients communicating with their physicians was 35.7%. The route of communication was by phone (34.8%). The frequency of depression and anxiety was 27.0% and 38.3%, respectively. The rates of drug discontinuation (35.1% vs 16.7%, p<0.05) and depression (37.8% vs 21.8%, p=0.07) were higher in nintedanib users than in pirfenidone users. Only two (1.7%) patients had COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion (>50%) of patients self-cancelled their appointments and nearly a quarter of patients discontinued their medications. Providing a documentation of the problems experienced by patients with IPF about management of the necessary requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study may be a model for patients with chronic diseases."
