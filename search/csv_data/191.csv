1900,CT abnormalities evocative of lung infection are associated with lower (18)F-FDG uptake in confirmed COVID-19 patients.,"Purpose: CT signs that are evocative of lung COVID-19 infections have been extensively described, whereas 18F-FDG-PET signs have not. Our current study aimed to identify specific COVID-19 18F-FDG-PET signs in patients that were (i) suspected to have a lung infection based on 18F-FDG-PET/CT recorded during the COVID-19 outbreak and (ii) whose COVID-19 diagnosis was definitely established or excluded by appropriate viral testing. Methods: Twenty-two consecutive patients referred for routine 18F-FDG-PET/CT examinations during the COVID-19 outbreak (March 25th to May 15th 2020) and for whom CT slices were evocative of a lung infection were included in the study. All patients had undergone a SARS-COV-2 diagnostic test to confirm COVID-19 infection (positivity was based on molecular and/or serological tests) or exclude it (negativity of at least the serological test). Results: Eleven patients were confirmed to be affected by COVID-19 (COVID+), whereas the other eleven patients were not (COVID-) and were predominantly suspected of having bacterial pneumonia. CT abnormalities were not significantly different between COVID+ and COVID- groups, although trends toward larger CT abnormalities (p = 0.16) and lower rates of consolidation patterns (0.09) were observed in the COVID+ group. The maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of lung areas with CT abnormalities were however significantly lower in the COVID+ than the COVID- group (3.7 ± 1.9 vs. 6.9 ± 4.1, p = 0.03), with the highest SUVmax consistently not associated with COVID-19. Conclusion: Among CT abnormalities evocative of lung infection, those related to COVID-19 are associated with a more limited 18F-FDG uptake. This observation may help improve our ability to detect COVID-19 patients."

1902,COVID-19 antibody tests: statistical implications.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant implications for society, with the introduction of restrictive social measures. Antibody tests provide a way of identifying patients who have been previously exposed to the virus and thus may have a degree of immunity. This is important in the development of public health policy, as local and national bodies seek to relax social restrictions in an attempt to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic. This article explores the essential statistical concepts used to interpret the findings of diagnostic investigations, with examples illustrated using COVID-19 antibody tests."
1903,Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is extremely vivacious in subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic calls for rapid actions, now principally oriented to a world-wide vaccination campaign. In this study we verified if, in individuals with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, a single dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine would be immunologically equivalent to a full vaccine schedule in naïve individuals. Health care workers (184) with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were sampled soon before the second dose of vaccine and between 7 and 10 days after the second dose, the last sampling time was applied to SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals, too. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay. The study was powered for non-inferiority. We used non parametric tests and Pearson correlation test to perform inferential analysis. After a single vaccine injection, the median titer of specific antibodies in individuals with previous coronavirus disease 2019 was 30.527 U/ml (interquartile range [IQR]: 19.992-39.288) and in subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection was 19.367.5 U/ml (IQR: 14.688-31.353) (p = .032). Both results were far above the median titer in naïve individuals after a full vaccination schedule: 1974.5 U/ml (IQR: 895-3455) (p < .0001). Adverse events after vaccine injection were more frequent after the second dose of vaccine (mean: 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75-1.14 vs. mean: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.63-2.19) (p < .0001) and in exposed compared to naïve (mean: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.28-1.98 vs. mean: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.87-2.82) (p = .015). In SARS-CoV-2 naturally infected individuals a single mRNA vaccine dose seems sufficient to reach immunity. Modifying current dosing schedules would speed-up vaccination campaigns."
1904,"Development and Validation of a Multiplex, Bead-based Assay to Detect Antibodies Directed Against SARS-CoV-2 Proteins.","Background: Transplant recipients who develop COVID-19 may be at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Determining the status of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in both candidates and recipients will be important to understand the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 in this population. While there are multiple tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, their performance is variable. Tests vary according to their platforms and the antigenic targets which make interpretation of the results challenging. Furthermore, for some assays, sensitivity and specificity are less than optimal. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses rather than SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This study describes the development and validation of a high-throughput multiplex antibody detection assay. Results: The multiplex assay has the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely, the full spike protein, 3 individual domains of the spike protein (S1, S2, and receptor binding domain), and the nucleocapsid protein. The antibody response to the above proteins are SARS-CoV-2-specific, as antibodies against 4 common coronaviruses do not cross-react. Conclusions: This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SAR-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting. Test configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients."

1906,[Internal validity of a rapid test for COVID-19 antigens in a nursing home].,"Introduction: RT-qPCR is the reference test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are now available. In this work, the internal validity of the RADT was evaluated in the context of an outbreak in a nursing home. Methods: Nasopharyngeal exudate samples were analyzed by RADT and RT-qPCR from 61 residents of a nursing home. The sensitivity and specificity of RADT with respect to RT-qPCR was calculated. Results: Specificity was 100% (95% CI 54.1-100.0), while sensitivity in asymptomatic people was 70.3% (95% CI 53.0-84.1) and in symptomatic people 83.3% (95% CI 51.6-97.9). Conclusions: The RADTs are sufficiently sensitive and specific to be used as screening tests in nursing homes, especially in situations of outbreaks or suspected outbreaks due to the presence of symptoms."
1907,Therapeutic Agents Against COVID-19 with Clinical Evidence.,"Over 57 million people have been confirmed to have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. Although several drugs have shown potential therapeutic effects, there is no specific drug against COVID-19. In this review, we summarized potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19 with clinical evidence, including antiviral agents, anti-cytokine storm syndrome agents, and vaccines, as well as other drugs. In addition, we briefly discussed their effects on COVID-19, which will contribute to developing treatment plans."
1908,Vaccination of Pregnant Women Against COVID-19.,"Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe morbidity and mortality following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading some countries to recommend vaccination of pregnant women against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These recommendations are based on studies conducted early in the pandemic, and thus, the pregnant women in these studies most likely did not have pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of infection. The susceptibility of pregnant women and their infants to SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of infection may be attenuated as the pandemic progresses and an increasing number of women will have pre-existing immunity (following natural infection or vaccination prior to pregnancy) during pregnancy. The reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines administered in pregnancy may also be affected by the pre-existing immunity of pregnant women. Maternal vaccine trials should be evaluated in the context of their timing in the pandemic and interpreted based on the pre-existing immunity of pregnant women."
1909,SARS-CoV-2 replicating in nonprimate mammalian cells probably have critical advantages for COVID-19 vaccines due to anti-Gal antibodies: A minireview and proposals.,"Glycoproteins of enveloped viruses replicating in nonprimate mammalian cells carry α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal) glycans, and can bind to anti-Gal antibodies which are abundant in humans. The antibodies have protected humans and their ancestors for millions of years, because they inhibit replication of many kinds of microbes carrying αGal glycans and aid complements and macrophages to destroy them. Therefore, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicating in nonprimate mammalian cells (eg, PK-15 cells) carry αGal glycans and could be employed as a live vaccine for corona virus 2019 (COVID-19). The live vaccine safety could be further enhanced through intramuscular inoculation to bypass the fragile lungs, like the live unattenuated adenovirus vaccine safely used in US recruits for decades. Moreover, the immune complexes of SARS-CoV-2 and anti-Gal antibodies could enhance the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, live or inactivated, carrying α-Gal glycans. Experiments are imperatively desired to examine these novel vaccine strategies which probably have the critical advantages for defeating the pandemic of COVID-19 and preventing other viral infectious diseases."
