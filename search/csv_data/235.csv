2341,Clinical diagnostic performance evaluation of five immunoassays for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in a real-life routine care setting.,"While molecular techniques remain the gold standard for diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, serological tests have the unique potential to ascertain how much of the population has been exposed to the COVID-19 pathogen. There have been limited published studies to date documenting the performance of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in Nigeria and so we evaluated the diagnostic performance of five (5) immunoassay on a set of clinical samples. Five automated immunoassays (2019-nCoV IgG/IgM antibody determination kit, Tigsun COVID-19 combo IgM/IgG rapid test, rapid response COVID-19 IgG/IgM test, COVID-19 IgM-IgG combined antibody rapid test, iChroma COVID-19 Ab) were tested. Three hundred and fourteen specimens were analyzed from health care workers who tested positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 with symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 receiving treatment at two treatment centres in Nasarawa State from March to September, 2020 with control of 134 health care workers who tested negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 with no symptoms to SARS-CoV-2. The median patients' age was 40 years (IQR 39.8-41), majority were male and were on admission. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody evaluated kits had a sensitivity of 33% (2019-nCoV IgG/IgM antibody determination kit), 22% (Tigsun COVID-19 combo IgM/IgG rapid test), 43% (rapid response COVID-19 IgG/IgM test), 44% (COVID-19 IgM-IgG combined antibody rapid test), 25% (iChroma COVID-19 Ab), 100% sensitivity, accuracy of 68.5% and Kappa coefficient of 0.7 and rapid response COVID-19 IgG/IgM test cassette had a sensitivity of 33%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 72.5% with Kappa coefficient 0.7. The Tigsun COVID-19 combo IgM/IgG rapid test (lateral flow), positive, COVID-19 IgM-IgG combined antibody rapid test and iChroma COVID-19 Ab RT all had sensitivity of zero percent. Serology was complementary to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at least 14 days after onset of symptoms. The assay panel needs to be improved to serve as an option for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in resource constrained settings where there are limited molecular diagnostics testing panels."

2343,Comparison of three TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays in detecting SARS-CoV-2.,"Quick and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for COVID-19 control. Dozens of real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays have been developed to meet the urgent need of COVID-19 control. However, methodological comparisons among the developed qRT-PCR assays are limited. In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, amplification efficiency, and linear detection ranges of three qRT-PCR assays, including the assays developed by our group (IPBCAMS), and the assays recommended by WHO and China CDC (CCDC). The three qRT-PCR assays exhibited similar sensitivities, with the limit of detection (LoD) at about 10 copies per reaction (except the ORF 1b gene assay in CCDC assays with a LoD at about 100 copies per reaction). No cross reaction with other respiratory viruses were observed in all of the three qRT-PCR assays. Wide linear detection ranges from 106 to 101 copies per reaction and acceptable reproducibility were obtained. By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92 % and 100 %, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60 %), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64 %) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48 % and 20 %, respectively). In conclusion, the N gene assays of CCDC assays and IPBCAMS assays and the ORF 1b gene assay of IPBCAMS assays were recommended for qRT-PCR screening of SARS-CoV-2."
2344,Convalescent-Phase Sera and Vaccine-Elicited Antibodies Largely Maintain Neutralizing Titer against Global SARS-CoV-2 Variant Spikes.,"The increasing prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with spike protein mutations raises concerns that antibodies elicited by natural infection or vaccination and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies will become less effective. We show that convalescent-phase sera neutralize pseudotyped viruses with the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.1.248, COH.20G/677H, 20A.EU2, and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor loss in titer. Similarly, antibodies elicited by Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccination neutralized B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 with only a 3-fold decrease in titer, an effect attributable to E484K. Analysis of the Regeneron monoclonal antibodies REGN10933 and REGN10987 showed that REGN10933 has lost neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 pseudotyped viruses, and the cocktail is 9- to 15-fold decreased in titer. These findings suggest that antibodies elicited by natural infection and by the Pfizer vaccine will maintain protection against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.248 variants but that monoclonal antibody therapy may be less effective for patients infected with B.1.351 or B.1.1.248 SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns with regard to their potential to escape from vaccine-elicited antibodies and anti-spike protein monoclonal antibodies. We report here on an analysis of sera from recovered patients and vaccinated individuals and on neutralization by Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Overall, the variants were neutralized nearly as well as the wild-type pseudotyped virus. The B.1.351 variant was somewhat resistant to vaccine-elicited antibodies but was still readily neutralized. One of the two Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibodies seems to have lost most of its activity against the B.1.351 variant, raising concerns that the combination therapy might be less effective for some patients. The findings should alleviate concerns that vaccines will become ineffective but suggest the importance of continued surveillance for potential new variants."
2345,What defines an efficacious COVID-19 vaccine? A review of the challenges assessing the clinical efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.,"The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 1 million deaths in the first 6 months of the pandemic and huge economic and social upheaval internationally. An efficacious vaccine is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Although some countries might deploy COVID-19 vaccines on the strength of safety and immunogenicity data alone, the goal of vaccine development is to gain direct evidence of vaccine efficacy in protecting humans against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 so that manufacture of efficacious vaccines can be selectively upscaled. A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements could contribute to disease control. However, the most important efficacy endpoint, protection against severe disease and death, is difficult to assess in phase 3 clinical trials. In this Review, we explore the challenges in assessing the efficacy of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, discuss the caveats needed to interpret reported efficacy endpoints, and provide insight into answering the seemingly simple question, ""Does this COVID-19 vaccine work?"""
2346,Chilblains in children in the time of COVID-19: New evidence with serology assay.,"In a previous report in Pediatric Dermatology, we described chilblains‚Äêlike lesions in four pediatric patients. From April 18 to May 10, 2020, 45 children presented to our Pediatric Dermatology department with similar acral lesions. The clinical appearance ranged from red to violaceous macules and dusky, purpuric plaques on the heels, soles and lateral margin of the feet, often accompanied by painful edema, consistent with chilblains."

2348,Cardiac Manifestations of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Following COVID-19.,"Purpose of review: To review the spectrum of cardiac manifestations and treatments of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recent findings: Studies demonstrate that up to 80% of children with MIS-C may have cardiac involvement on a spectrum of severity. Cardiac manifestations include myocarditis, coronary artery aneurysms, conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias. Current treatments, including inotropic support, immunomodulatory therapy, and anti-coagulation, have been effective at resolving these cardiac findings in the majority of patients. COVID-19 can also cause myocarditis in the acute stage of illness and recent descriptions of COVID-19 vaccine myocarditis have occurred. Cardiac manifestations are common in MIS-C and should be assessed for at presentation and during the clinical course as indicated."
