7131,Capacity Evaluation of Diagnostic Tests For COVID-19 Using Multicriteria Decision-Making Techniques.,"In December 2019, cases of pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, China, which were caused by the highly contagious coronavirus. This study is aimed at comparing the confusion regarding the selection of effective diagnostic methods to make a mutual comparison among existing SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and at determining the most effective one. Based on available published evidence and clinical practice, diagnostic tests of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were evaluated by multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, namely, fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (fuzzy PROMETHEE) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS). Computerized tomography of chest (chest CT), the detection of viral nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction, cell culture, CoV-19 antigen detection, CoV-19 antibody IgM, CoV-19 antibody IgG, and chest X-ray were evaluated by linguistic fuzzy scale to compare among the diagnostic tests. This scale consists of selected parameters that possessed different weights which were determined by the experts' opinions of the field. The results of our study with both proposed MCDM methods indicated that the most effective diagnosis method of COVID-19 was chest CT. It is interesting to note that the methods that are consistently used in the diagnosis of viral diseases were ranked in second place for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, each country should use appropriate diagnostic solutions according to its own resources. Our findings also show which diagnostic systems can be used in combination."
7132,"Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 strains carrying a nucleotide mutation, leading to a stop codon in the ORF 6 protein.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated from the oro/pharyngeal swabs of two Italian COVID-19 patients, physicians in a COVID-19 division hospital, with different courses of the disease. The complete genome sequences show that the two isolates belong to the B1.1 lineage, but contain a nucleotide mutation in the ORF6, leading to a stop codon and to the deletion of 6 amino acids in the C terminus. This deletion was unique, compared to the currently available sequences deposited in the GISAID and GenBank database. It did not affect the in vitro viral replication, neither the neutralizing activities of the patients' antibodies. Based on homology analysis with other Coronaviruses, the two isolated lacked the ORF6 aminoacidic portion responsible for the inhibition of the antiviral Interferon (IFN)-based host response. IFN seems to have a dual role of in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients: not only antiviral activity, but also a detrimental role in case of excessive production. A deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 protein might have a specific, still unknown role in the viral pathogenesis."
7133,"Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A Virus in Patient with Pneumonia, China.","We report co-infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A virus in a patient with pneumonia in China. The case highlights possible co-detection of known respiratory viruses. We noted low sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for SARS-CoV-2, which could further complicate recognition of the full extent of disease."

7135,Concentration of infectious SARS-CoV-2 by polyethylene glycol precipitation.,The development of medical countermeasures against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires robust viral assays. Here we have adapted a protocol for polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated precipitation of SARS-CoV-2 stocks without the need for ultracentrifugation. Virus precipitation resulted in a âˆ¼1.5 log10 increase in SARS-CoV-2 titres of virus prepared in VeroE6 cells and enabled the infection of several immortalized human cell lines (Caco-2 and Calu-3) at a high multiplicity of infection not practically achievable without virus concentration. This protocol underscores the utility of PEG-mediated precipitation for SARS-CoV-2 and provides a resource for a range of coronavirus research areas.
7136,Strategic testing approaches for targeted disease monitoring can be used to inform pandemic decision-making.,"More than 1.6 million Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were administered daily in the United States at the peak of the epidemic, with a significant focus on individual treatment. Here, we show that objective-driven, strategic sampling designs and analyses can maximize information gain at the population level, which is necessary to increase situational awareness and predict, prepare for, and respond to a pandemic, while also continuing to inform individual treatment. By focusing on specific objectives such as individual treatment or disease prediction and control (e.g., via the collection of population-level statistics to inform lockdown measures or vaccine rollout) and drawing from the literature on capture-recapture methods to deal with nonrandom sampling and testing errors, we illustrate how public health objectives can be achieved even with limited test availability when testing programs are designed a priori to meet those objectives."

7139,Chinese Therapeutic Strategy for Fighting COVID-19 and Potential Small-Molecule Inhibitors against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 20 million people infected worldwide with an average mortality rate of 3.6%. This virus poses major challenges to public health, as it not only is highly contagious but also can be transmitted by asymptomatic infected individuals. COVID-19 is clinically difficult to manage due to a lack of specific antiviral drugs or vaccines. In this article, Chinese therapy strategies for treating COVID-19 patients, including current applications of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), are comprehensively reviewed. Furthermore, 72 small molecules from natural products and TCM with reported antiviral activity against human coronaviruses (CoVs) are identified from published literature, and their potential applications in combating SARS-CoV-2 are discussed. Among these, the clinical efficacies of some accessible drugs such as remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir (FPV) for COVID-19 are emphatically summarized. We hope this review provides a foundation for managing the worsening pandemic and developing antivirals against SARS-CoV-2."
