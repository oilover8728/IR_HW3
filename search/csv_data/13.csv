120,Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is not the same as covid-19.,
121,Typical CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients presenting with repetitive negative RT-PCR.,"Multiple polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard diagnostic investigation for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, false negative multiple polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results can be diagnostically challenging. We report three patients with history of fever and different clinical signs. During the height of the pandemic in Italy (March to May 2020), these patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scans that showed lung alterations typical of COVID-19 with multiple negative RT-PCR tests and positive serology for SARS-CoV-2. Two of the three patients showed residual pneumonia on CT after the onset of the first clinical signs. One patient presented with diarrhoea without respiratory symptoms. These cases suggest that in the COVID-19 pandemic period, to provide an earlier specific treatment in patients with positive serology, a chest CT scan can be useful in those presenting with a fever or a history of fever associated with persistent mild respiratory symptoms or with abdominal complaints despite repeated negative RT-PCR results."
122,End-point RT-PCR: A potential alternative for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered the ""gold standard"" for the direct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, routine diagnosis by RT-qPCR is a limitation for many laboratories, mainly due to the infrastructure and/or disproportionate relationship between demand and supply of inputs. In this context, and to increase the diagnostic coverage of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we describe an alternative, sensitive and specific one-step end-point RT-PCR for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. The performance of the RT-PCR was evaluated in 43 clinical samples, of which 10 and 33 were previously identified as negative and positive, respectively, by RT-qPCR. Among the positive samples, 15 and 18 were from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, respectively. Here, 32/33 of the positive samples in the RT-qPCR, including from asymptomatic individuals, were found positive in the RT-PCR (Ct 15.94-34.92). The analytical sensitivity of the assay was about 7.15-9 copies of vRNA/μL, and nonspecific amplifications were not observed in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. Importantly, the RT-PCR reactions were performed in a 10 μL final volume. Finally, considering specificity, analytical sensitivity and cost reduction, we believe that the RT-PCR platform described here may be a viable option for the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections in laboratories in which RT-qPCR is not available."
123,Characteristics and predictors of hospitalization and death in the first 11 122 cases with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark: a nationwide cohort.,"Background: Population-level knowledge on individuals at high risk of severe and fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is urgently needed to inform targeted protection strategies in the general population. Methods: We examined characteristics and predictors of hospitalization and death in a nationwide cohort of all Danish individuals tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from 27 February 2020 until 19 May 2020. Results: We identified 11 122 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction-positive cases of whom 80% were community-managed and 20% were hospitalized. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 5.2%. Age was strongly associated with fatal disease {odds ratio [OR] 15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 9-26] for 70-79 years, increasing to OR 90 (95% CI: 50-162) for ≥90 years, when compared with cases aged 50-59 years and adjusted for sex and number of co-morbidities}. Similarly, the number of co-morbidities was associated with fatal disease [OR 5.2 (95% CI: 3.4-8.0), for cases with at least four co-morbidities vs no co-morbidities] and 79% of fatal cases had at least two co-morbidities. Most major chronic diseases were associated with hospitalization, with ORs ranging from 1.3-1.4 (e.g. stroke, ischaemic heart disease) to 2.6-3.4 (e.g. heart failure, hospital-diagnosed kidney disease, organ transplantation) and with mortality with ORs ranging from 1.1-1.3 (e.g. ischaemic heart disease, hypertension) to 2.5-3.2 (e.g. major psychiatric disorder, organ transplantation). In the absence of co-morbidities, mortality was <5% in persons aged ≤80 years. Conclusions: In this nationwide population-based COVID-19 study, increasing age and multimorbidity were strongly associated with hospitalization and death. In the absence of co-morbidities, the mortality was, however, <5% until the age of 80 years."
124,COVID-19 Australia: Epidemiology Report 38 Reporting period ending 28 March 2021.,
125,Pooled Saliva Specimens for SARS-CoV-2 Testing.,"We evaluated saliva (SAL) specimens for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) testing by comparison of 459 prospectively paired nasopharyngeal (NP) or midturbinate (MT) swabs from 449 individuals with the aim of using saliva for asymptomatic screening. Samples were collected in a drive-through car line for symptomatic individuals (n = 380) and in the emergency department (ED) (n = 69). The percentages of positive and negative agreement of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab were 81.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.8% to 90.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI, 98.7% to 100%), respectively. The percent positive agreement increased to 90.0% (95% CI, 74.4% to 96.5%) when considering only samples with moderate to high viral load (cycle threshold [CT ] for the NP, ≤34). Pools of five saliva specimens were also evaluated on three platforms, bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG with ABI 7500Fast (CDC assay), Hologic Panther Fusion, and Roche Cobas 6800. The average loss of signal upon pooling was 2 to 3 CT values across the platforms. The sensitivities of detecting a positive specimen in a pool compared with testing individually were 94%, 90%, and 94% for the CDC 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR, Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay, and Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test, respectively, with decreased sample detection trending with lower viral load. We conclude that although pooled saliva testing, as collected in this study, is not quite as sensitive as NP/MT testing, saliva testing is adequate to detect individuals with higher viral loads in an asymptomatic screening program, does not require swabs or viral transport medium for collection, and may help to improve voluntary screening compliance for those individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections."
126,Clinical and Epidemiologic Evaluation of Inconclusive COVID-19 PCR Results Using a Quantitative Algorithm.,"Objectives: The inconclusive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result causes confusion and delay for infection prevention precautions and patient management. We aimed to develop a quantitative algorithm to assess and interpret these inconclusive results. Methods: We created a score-based algorithm by combining laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic data to evaluate 69 cases with inconclusive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assay (18 cases) and the TaqPath assay (51 cases). Results: We determined 5 (28%) of 18 (CDC assay) and 20 (39%) of 51 (TaqPath assay) cases to be false positive. Lowering the cycle threshold cutoff from 40 to 37 in the TaqPath assay resulted in a dramatic reduction of the false-positive rate to 14%. We also showed testing of asymptomatic individuals is associated with a significantly higher probability of having a false-positive result. Conclusions: A substantial percentage of inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results can be false positive, especially among asymptomatic patients. The quantitative algorithm we created was shown to be effective and could provide a useful tool for clinicians and hospital epidemiologists to interpret inconclusive COVID-19 PCR results and provide clinical guidance when additional PCR or antibody test results are available."
127,The Microbiology of Coronaviruses.,"The end of 2019 marked the start of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic from China, which went on to envelope more than 190 countries and territories across the globe. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from a group of betacoronaviruses, is responsible for COVID-19. The virulent factors include the presence of envelope and spike proteins having receptor bonding domains (RBD). Clinical manifestations can range from mild respiratory infections to fatal outcomes. The viability of virus ranges from 3 to 72 hours. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the diagnostic test of choice in this pandemic situation. Due to the absence of specific antivirals and vaccine, adoption of preventive option can help to combat the specific life-threatening outcomes."
128,A Comparison of Five SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Assays With Clinical Correlations.,"Objectives: Comparative assessments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) molecular assays that have been operationalized through the US Food and Drug Administration's Emergency Use Authorization process are warranted to assess real-world performance. Characteristics such as sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rate are important to inform clinical use. Methods: We compared five SARS-CoV-2 assays using nasopharyngeal and nasal swab specimens submitted in transport media; we enriched this cohort for positive specimens, since we were particularly interested in the sensitivity and false-negative rate. Performance of each test was compared with a composite standard. Results: The sensitivities and false-negative rates of the 239 specimens that met inclusion criteria were, respectively, as follows: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019 nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, 100% and 0%; TIB MOLBIOL/Roche z 480 Assay, 96.5% and 3.5%; Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid), 97.6% and 2.4%; Simplexa COVID-19 Direct Kit (DiaSorin), 88.1% and 11.9%; and ID Now COVID-19 (Abbott), 83.3% and 16.7%. Conclusions: The assays that included a nucleic acid extraction followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were more sensitive than assays that lacked a full extraction. Most false negatives were seen in patients with low viral loads, as extrapolated from crossing threshold values."
129,"Evaluation of clinical utility of novel coronavirus antigen detection reagent, Espline SARS-CoV-2.","Background: To prevent the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is necessary to perform early identification and isolation of people shedding the infectious virus in biological materials with high viral loads several days prior to symptom onset. Rapid antigen tests for infectious diseases are useful to prevent the pandemic spread in clinical settings. Methods: We evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 antigen test, Espline® SARS-CoV-2 reagent, with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as reference test, using 129 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from COVID-19 hospitalized patients or from patients suspected having COVID-19-like symptoms. Out of these, 63 RT-PCR positive and 66 RT-PCR negative specimens were identified. Results: Among 63 RT-PCR positive specimens, 25 were positive in the Espline test. Test sensitivity was estimated based on the 532.4 copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained through receiver operating characteristic analysis. When the specimens were classified based on time since symptom onset, Espline test sensitivity were 73.3% and 29.2% in specimens collected before day 9 and after day 10, respectively. Conclusion: Although the overall sensitivity of the Espline® SARS-CoV-2 reagent compared with RT-PCR is less, this antigen test can be useful in identifying people with high risk of virus transmission with high viral loads in order to prevent the pandemic and is useful for diagnosing COVID-19 within 30 min."
