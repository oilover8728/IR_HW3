3912,Donor to recipient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by lung transplantation despite negative donor upper respiratory tract testing.,"We describe a case of proven transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from lung donor to recipient. The donor had no clinical history or findings suggestive of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and tested negative by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab obtained within 48 h of procurement. Lower respiratory tract testing was not performed. The recipient developed fever, hypotension, and pulmonary infiltrates on posttransplant day (PTD) 3, and RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 on an NP swab specimen was non-reactive, but positive on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. One thoracic surgeon present during the transplantation procedure developed COVID-19. Sequence analysis of isolates from donor BAL fluid (obtained at procurement), the recipient, and the infected thoracic surgeon proved donor origin of recipient and health-care worker (HCW) infection. No other organs were procured from this donor. Transplant centers and organ procurement organizations should perform SARS-CoV-2 testing of lower respiratory tract specimens from potential lung donors, and consider enhanced personal protective equipment for HCWs involved in lung procurement and transplantation."

3916,Increases in SARS-CoV-2 Test Positivity Rates Among Hispanic People in a Northern California Health System.,"Racial/ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 testing patterns and positivity rates in a large health care system in Northern California. The study population included patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 4, 2020, through January 12, 2021, at Stanford Health Care. We used adjusted hierarchical logistic regression models to identify factors associated with receiving a positive test result. During the study period, 282 916 SARS-CoV-2 tests were administered to 179 032 unique patients, 32 766 (18.3%) of whom were Hispanic. Hispanic patients were 3 times more likely to receive a positive test result than patients in other racial/ethnic groups (odds ratio = 3.16; 95% CI, 3.00-3.32). The rate of receiving a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 among Hispanic patients increased from 5.4% in mid-March to 15.7% in mid-July, decreased to 3.9% in mid-October, and increased to 21.2% toward the end of December. Hispanic patients were more likely than non-Hispanic patients to receive a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, with increasing trends during regional surges. The disproportionate and growing overrepresentation of Hispanic people receiving a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the need to focus public health prevention efforts on these communities."

3918,In silico trial to test COVID-19 candidate vaccines: a case study with UISS platform.,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a severe respiratory infection that infects humans. Its outburst entitled it as a pandemic emergence. To get a grip on this outbreak, specific preventive and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. It must be said that, until now, there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To promptly and rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired effects. Results: We present an in silico platform that showed to be in very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response. Moreover, it has been used to predict the outcome of one of the latest suggested approach to design an effective vaccine, based on monoclonal antibody. Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) in silico platform is potentially ready to be used as an in silico trial platform to predict the outcome of vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: In silico trials are showing to be powerful weapons in predicting immune responses of potential candidate vaccines. Here, UISS has been extended to be used as an in silico trial platform to speed-up and drive the discovery pipeline of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2."
3919,Short-term experiences of a liver transplant centre before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Background/aim: With the COVID-19 pandemic, managing the process of solid organ transplantation has become a significant matter for transplant centres. In this study, we report our experiences on evaluating the effects of COVID-19 in patients with recent liver transplants. Materials and methods: We evaluated patients who received liver transplants during three close consecutive periods of time. For transplants conducted between October 1 and December 31, 2019, January 1 and March 10, 2020 and March 11 and June 22, 2020, the lung tomographies of patients were inspected for radiological signs of viral pneumonia. For patients after March 11, 2020, the hospital's electronic database system was scanned for preoperative and postoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing from Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of the respiratory tract samples. Results: A total of 149 patients over the age of 18 who received liver transplants at our centre between October 1, 2019 and June 22, 2020 were evaluated. During this time span, our centre conducted liver transplants on patients from 34 different provinces and also abroad. Within this time period, a total of nine patients had respiratory samples with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. PCR of respiratory tract samples was performed in 21 (14%) patients to identify the other potential infective agents in the respiratory tracts; Rhinovirus and Influenza A were detected in two and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in one patient. During the transplant periods, 99 (67.1%) patients were evaluated with computed tomography (CT). The CT findings of 18 (12%) patients were consistent with viral pneumonia. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups only in terms of air bronchogram findings (P = .012). Conclusion: The clinical status of our short-term liver transplant patients was far better than we originally anticipated, but it remains obvious that the necessary precautions should continue to be taken."
