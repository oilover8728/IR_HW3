3820,Infection-Mediated Clinical Biomarkers for a COVID-19 Electrical Biosensing Platform.,"The race towards the development of user-friendly, portable, fast-detection, and low-cost devices for healthcare systems has become the focus of effective screening efforts since the pandemic attack in December 2019, which is known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently existing techniques such as RT-PCR, antigen-antibody-based detection, and CT scans are prompt solutions for diagnosing infected patients. However, the limitations of currently available indicators have enticed researchers to search for adjunct or additional solutions for COVID-19 diagnosis. Meanwhile, identifying biomarkers or indicators is necessary for understanding the severity of the disease and aids in developing efficient drugs and vaccines. Therefore, clinical studies on infected patients revealed that infection-mediated clinical biomarkers, especially pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins, are highly associated with COVID-19. These biomarkers are undermined or overlooked in the context of diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of infected patients. Hence, this review discusses the potential implementation of these biomarkers for COVID-19 electrical biosensing platforms. The secretion range for each biomarker is reviewed based on clinical studies. Currently available electrical biosensors comprising electrochemical and electronic biosensors associated with these biomarkers are discussed, and insights into the use of infection-mediated clinical biomarkers as prognostic and adjunct diagnostic indicators in developing an electrical-based COVID-19 biosensor are provided."
3821,[Research study on nucleic acid testing of hemostatic stickers used and the surface of the recipients' hands after the inoculation of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine].,"Among the staff of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, who received the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on January 30 in 2021, 28 recipients were selected for this research. Samples for nucleic acid tests were collected from the surface of the recipients' both hands before and after vaccination. The hemostatic stickers used after the inoculation were also collected for nucleic acid tests. The nucleic acid tests of the samples collected from the surface of both hands of the 28 recipients before vaccination were all negative. After vaccination, the nucleic acid tests of the samples collected from the surface of both hands of recipients were positive in 3 cases, and suspicious in 8 cases, with a positive rate of 10.7%. A total of 25 hemostatic stickers used were collected, 24 of them had positive nucleic acid tests, and the rest one had suspicious nucleic acid test result, with a positive rate of 96%. The hemostatic stickers used after the inoculation have the risk of nucleic acid contamination."
3822,An intersectional human rights approach to prioritising access to COVID-19 vaccines.,"We finally have a vaccine for the COVID-19 crisis. However, due to the limited numbers of the vaccine, states will have to consider how to prioritise groups who receive the vaccine. In this paper, we argue that the practical implementation of human rights law requires broader consideration of intersectional needs in society and the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 is having on population groups with pre-existing social and medical vulnerabilities. The existing frameworks/mechanisms and proposals for COVID-19 vaccine allocation have shortcomings from a human rights perspective that could be remedied by adopting an intersectional allocative approach. This necessitates that states allocate the first COVID-19 vaccines according to (1) infection risk and severity of pre-existing diseases; (2) social vulnerabilities; and (3) potential financial and social effects of ill health. In line with WHO's guidelines on universal health coverage, a COVID-19 vaccine allocation strategy that it is more consistent with international human rights law should ensure that vaccines are free at the point of service, give priority to the worst off and be allocated in a transparent, participatory and accountable prioritisation process."
3823,The challenge of avidity determination in SARS-CoV-2 serology.,"The serological responses towards severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleoprotein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), and spike protein S1 are characterized by incomplete avidity maturation. Analysis with varying concentrations of urea allows to determine distinct differences in avidity maturation, though the total process remains at an unusually low level. Despite incomplete avidity maturation, this approach allows to define early and late stages of infection. It therefore can compensate for the recently described irregular kinetic patterns of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed towards SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The serological responses towards seasonal coronaviruses neither have a negative nor positive impact on SARS-CoV-2 serology in general. Avidity determination in combination with measurement of antibody titers and complexity of the immune response allows to clearly differentiate between IgG responses towards seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Cross-reactions seem to occur with very low probability. They can be recognized by their pattern of response and through differential treatment with urea. As high avidity has been shown to be essential in several virus systems for the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies, it should be clarified whether high avidity of IgG directed towards RBD indicates protective immunity. If this is the case, monitoring of avidity should be part of the optimization of vaccination programs."
3824,First results of a national external quality assessment scheme for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences.,"Background: Broad and decentralised testing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA genomes is a WHO-recommended strategy to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by identifying infected cases in order to minimize onward transmission. With the need to increase the test capacities in Austria, nation-wide numerous laboratories rapidly implemented assays for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on real-time RT-PCR assays. The objective of this study was to monitor reliability of the laboratory results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through an external quality assessment (EQA) scheme. Methods: For this, the Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna was tasked by the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection to perform the first Austrian EQA on SARS-CoV-2 which was organised in cooperation with the Austrian Association for Quality Assurance and Standardization of Medical and Diagnostic Tests (Ã–QUASTA). Data were analysed on the basis of qualitative outcome of testing in relation to the nucleic acid (NA) extraction and detection methods used. Results and conclusion: A total of 52 laboratories participated, contributing results from 67 test panels comprising 42 distinct combinations of NA extraction and PCR reagents. By testing 3 positive (CT values: S1, 28.4; S2, 33.6; S3, 38.5) and 1 negative sample, no false-positive results were obtained by any of the laboratories. Otherwise, 40/67 tests (60 %) detected all positive samples correctly as positive, but 25/67 tests (37 %) did not detect the weakest positive sample (S3), and 3 % reported S2 and S3 as false-negative. Improvement in test sensitivity by focusing on NA extraction and/or PCR-based detection is recommended."

3829,DIAG a Diagnostic Web Application Based on Lung CT Scan Images and Deep Learning.,"Coronavirus disease is a pandemic that has infected millions of people around the world. Lung CT-scans are effective diagnostic tools, but radiologists can quickly become overwhelmed by the flow of infected patients. Therefore, automated image interpretation needs to be achieved. Deep learning (DL) can support critical medical tasks including diagnostics, and DL algorithms have successfully been applied to the classification and detection of many diseases. This work aims to use deep learning methods that can classify patients between Covid-19 positive and healthy patient. We collected 4 available datasets, and tested our convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different distributions to investigate the generalizability of our models. In order to clearly explain the predictions, Grad-CAM and Fast-CAM visualization methods were used. Our approach reaches more than 92% accuracy on 2 different distributions. In addition, we propose a computer aided diagnosis web application for Covid-19 diagnosis. The results suggest that our proposed deep learning tool can be integrated to the Covid-19 detection process and be useful for a rapid patient management."
