4920,"Scientific misinformation: A perfect storm, missteps, and moving forward.","The spread of scientific misinformation is not new but rather has long posed threats to human health, environmental well-being, and the creation of a sustainable and equitable future. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to develop strategies to counteract scientific misinformation has taken on an acute urgency. Cell editor Nicole Neuman sat down with Walter Quattrociocchi and Dietram Scheufele to gain insights on how we got here and what does-and does not-work to fight the spread of scientific misinformation. Excerpts from this conversation, edited for clarity and length, are presented below, and the full conversation is available with the article online."
4921,Clinical Validation and Performance Evaluation of the Automated Vitros Total Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Assay for Screening of Serostatus in COVID-19.,"Objectives: Evaluation of serostatus against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as an important tool in identification of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report on the validation of the Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total (CoV2T) assay for qualitative serologic testing of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: We performed validation studies according to Commission of Office Laboratories Accreditation guidelines, using samples previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We evaluated precision, analytical interferences, and cross-reactivity with other viral infections; evaluated concordance with molecular and other serologic testing; and evaluated seroconversion. Results: The Vitros CoV2T assay exhibited acceptable precision and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with other acute respiratory virus infections. The CoV2T assay exhibited 100% negative predictive agreement (56/56) and 71% positive predictive agreement (56/79) with RT-PCR across all patient samples and was concordant with other serologic assays. Concordance with RT-PCR was 97% more than 7 days after symptom onset. The CoV2T assay was robust to icterus and lipemia but had interference from significant hemolysis. Conclusions: The Vitros CoV2T assay was successfully validated in our laboratory. We anticipate it will be a useful tool in screening for exposure to SARS-CoV-2; however, the use of the CoV2T and other serologic assays in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 is unknown and must be evaluated in future studies."
4922,CoVaccine HT Adjuvant Potentiates Robust Immune Responses to Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 Immunization.,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions, globally. The highly contagious nature of this respiratory virus has spurred massive global efforts to develop vaccines at record speeds. In addition to enhanced immunogen delivery, adjuvants may greatly impact protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To investigate adjuvant suitability, we formulated protein subunit vaccines consisting of the recombinant S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein alone or in combination with either CoVaccine HT™ or Alhydrogel. CoVaccine HT™ induced high titres of antigen-binding IgG after a single dose, facilitated affinity maturation and class switching to a greater extent than Alhydrogel and elicited potent cell-mediated immunity as well as virus neutralizing antibody titres. Data presented here suggests that adjuvantation with CoVaccine HT™ can rapidly induce a comprehensive and protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2."
4923,"Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac) in healthy adults aged 60 years and older: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial.","Background: A vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed for older adults, in whom morbidity and mortality due to the disease are increased. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, in adults aged 60 years and older. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial of CoronaVac in healthy adults aged 60 years and older in Renqiu (Hebei, China). Vaccine or placebo was given by intramuscular injection in two doses (days 0 and 28). Phase 1 comprised a dose-escalation study, in which participants were allocated to two blocks: block 1 (3 μg inactivated virus in 0·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide solution per injection) and block 2 (6 μg per injection). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1) using block randomisation to receive CoronaVac or placebo (aluminium hydroxide solution only). In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1) using block randomisation to receive either CoronaVac at 1·5 μg, 3 μg, or 6 μg per dose, or placebo. All participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one dose. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was seroconversion rate at 28 days after the second injection (which was assessed in all participants who had received the two doses of vaccine according to their random assignment, had antibody results available, and did not violate the trial protocol). Seroconversion was defined as a change from seronegative at baseline to seropositive for neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 (positive cutoff titre 1/8), or a four-fold titre increase if the participant was seropositive at baseline. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04383574). Findings: Between May 22 and June 1, 2020, 72 participants (24 in each intervention group and 24 in the placebo group; mean age 65·8 years [SD 4·8]) were enrolled in phase 1, and between June 12 and June 15, 2020, 350 participants were enrolled in phase 2 (100 in each intervention group and 50 in the placebo group; mean age 66·6 years [SD 4·7] in 349 participants). In the safety populations from both phases, any adverse reaction within 28 days after injection occurred in 20 (20%) of 100 participants in the 1·5 μg group, 25 (20%) of 125 in the 3 μg group, 27 (22%) of 123 in the 6 μg group, and 15 (21%) of 73 in the placebo group. All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity and injection site pain (39 [9%] of 421 participants) was the most frequently reported event. As of Aug 28, 2020, eight serious adverse events, considered unrelated to vaccination, have been reported by seven (2%) participants. In phase 1, seroconversion after the second dose was observed in 24 of 24 participants (100·0% [95% CI 85·8-100·0]) in the 3 μg group and 22 of 23 (95·7% [78·1-99·9]) in the 6 μg group. In phase 2, seroconversion was seen in 88 of 97 participants in the 1·5 μg group (90·7% [83·1-95·7]), 96 of 98 in the 3 μg group (98·0% [92·8-99·8]), and 97 of 98 (99·0% [94·5-100·0]) in the 6 μg group. There were no detectable antibody responses in the placebo groups. Interpretation: CoronaVac is safe and well tolerated in older adults. Neutralising antibody titres induced by the 3 μg dose were similar to those of the 6 μg dose, and higher than those of the 1·5 μg dose, supporting the use of the 3 μg dose CoronaVac in phase 3 trials to assess protection against COVID-19.

4924,Acceptance and Attitude toward COVID-19 Vaccination among the Public in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-sectional Study.,"Aim and objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate vaccine acceptance and attitude to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine among the general population in Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods: The present study was conducted among the general population in Saudi Arabia above 18 years of age. The data were collected online, by questionnaire containing 20 questions using Google form, in both Arabic and English, and were distributed to friends, families, and relatives through mail, WhatsApp groups, and Twitter. The questionnaire was randomly given out to the people living in five provinces of Saudi Arabia. Results: A sum of 1,713 participants responded to the online survey. The greatest number of participants were at the age between 31 years and 45 years (36.6%) and 56.4% were females. The results showed that 74.6% have not registered for the vaccination and 44.9% responded not to take the vaccine. About 60.80% were concerned about the side effects, and 48.2% were worried about the allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine. About 49.1% of participants agreed that preventive measures, such as wearing mask, social distance, and using sanitizers, keep the virus away, and 53.20% believes that being exposed to disease naturally is safer for the immune system. Around 23.90% believes that vaccination cannot reduce the possibility of getting COVID-19. Conclusion: In the present study, the negative attitudes and afraid of the side effects of the vaccine are the most reasons for indecision and rejection about COVID-19 vaccine. For the future COVID-19 vaccination campaign not to fail, the Ministry of Saudi Arabia should closely follow the vaccination development processes, inform the public transparently, and consider public's concerns. Clinical significance: The results of the current study will help the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia to attempt proactive missions by featuring the significance of immunization to the population and empowering vaccine take-up and acceptance."

4927,Predicting the Dynamics of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States Using Graph Theory-Based Neural Networks.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented social and economic consequences in the United States. Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial. Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic. As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible. To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one. To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero. Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic. For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks. We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN). The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States. While the GTNN model's edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another. We trained both models with Rt numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States. The performance of these models was evaluated with the datasets that included Rt values reflecting conditions from 22 January through 26 November 2020 (before the start of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States). To determine the efficiency, we compared the results of two models with each other and with those generated by a baseline Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The results indicated that the GTNN model outperformed both the NGNN and LSTM models for predicting Rt."
4928,"[Simultaneous diagnosis and favorable evolution of infection with Pneumocystis jirovecii, SARS-CoV-2 and advanced HIV].","SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease named COVID-19, which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and developed into the current pandemic. The manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are highly variable. The worst outcomes are usually associated with advanced age and known risk factors. Among these, it would be reasonable to consider conditions compromising the immune system, particularly the immunodeficiency associated to HIV. To date, however, there is no evidence of HIV infection worsening the evolution and prognosis of COVID-19. Pneumocystis jirovecii (previously-P. carinii) pneumonia, is a fungal disease that most commonly affects immunocompromised persons and can be life-threatening. Typically, patients at risk are those with any underlying condition altering host immunity. We present the case of a middle-aged woman with Raynaud's syndrome who was admitted with pneumonia. During hospitalization she was simultaneously diagnosed with infection by HIV, COVID-19 and P. jirovecci. The patient evolved favorably upon empirical treatment without requiring invasive maneuvers or ventilatory support. Outpatient follow-up after hospital discharge was uneventful."
4929,Optimal size of sample pooling for RNA pool testing: An avant-garde for scaling up severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 testing.,"Background and objectives: Timely diagnosis is essential for the containment of the disease and breaks in the chain of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The present situation demands the countries to scale up their testing and design innovative strategies to conserve diagnostic kits and reagents. The pooling of samples saves time, workforce and most importantly diagnostic kits and reagents. In the present study, we tried to define the pool size that could be applied with acceptable confidence for testing. Materials and methods: We used repeatedly tested positive clinical sample elutes having different levels of SARS CoV 2 RNA and negative sample elutes to prepare seven series of 11 pools each, having pool sizes ranging from 2 to 48 samples to estimate the optimal pool size. Each pool had one positive sample elute in different compositions. All the pools were tested by SARS CoV 2 reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Out of the 77 pools, only 53 (68.8%) were found positive. The sensitivity of pools of 2-48 samples was decreased from 100% (95% confidence interval [CL]; 98.4-100) to 41.41% (95% CL; 34.9-48.1). The maximum size of the pool with acceptable sensitivity (>95%) was found to be of six samples. For the pool size of six samples, the sensitivity was 97.8% and the efficiency of pooling was 0.38. Conclusions: The pooling of samples is a practical way for scaling up testing and ultimately containing the further spread of the CoV disease 2019 pandemic."
