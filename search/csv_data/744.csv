7430,Acro-ischaemia and COVID-19 infection: clinical and histopathological features.,"With the COVID‐19 pandemic we are facing a changing world. This new coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) poses new challenges to dermatologists too. Some of us are in the field, others are describing skin aspects related to this infection, either directly or indirectly caused (e.g: dermatoses resulting from prolonged contact with personal protective equipment and excessive personal hygiene). Still, cutaneous manifestations are uncommonly reported and the majority has no clinical or histological pictures."
7431,Anti-GAD associated post-infectious cerebellitis after COVID-19 infection.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread rapidly all over the world. Besides severe pneumonia, it causes multisystemic disease, including neurological findings. Here, we present a patient with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibody-associated cerebellitis developed after COVID-19 infection. The patient responded well to the immune treatments. Our knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection-related neurological disorders is limited. New data are needed to recognize the clinical spectrum of autoimmune neurological disorders that emerges after SARS-CoV-2 infection."

7433,"Genomic Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 Virus in Immunocompromised Patient, Ireland.",We examined virus genomic evolution in an immunocompromised patient with prolonged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Genomic sequencing revealed genetic variation during infection: 3 intrahost mutations and possible superinfection with a second strain of the virus. Prolonged infection in immunocompromised patients may lead to emergence of new virus variants.
7434,Inhaled corticosteroids do not adversely impact outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients with COPD: An analysis of Cleveland Clinic's COVID-19 registry.,"Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed to patients with severe COPD and recurrent exacerbations. It is not known what impact ICS cause in terms of COVID-19 positivity or disease severity in COPD. This study examined 27,810 patients with COPD from the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry between March 8th and September 16th, 2020. Electronic health records were used to determine diagnosis of COPD, ICS use, and clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for demographics, month of COVID-19 testing, and comorbidities known to be associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Amongst the COPD patients who were tested for COVID-19, 44.1% of those taking an ICS-containing inhaler tested positive for COVID-19 versus 47.2% who tested negative for COVID-19 (p = 0.033). Of those who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 1288), 371 (28.8%) required hospitalization. In-hospital outcomes were not significantly different when comparing ICS versus no ICS in terms of ICU admission (36.8% [74/201] vs 31.2% [53/170], p = 0.30), endotracheal intubation (21.9% [44/201] vs 16.5% [28/170], p = 0.24), or mortality (18.4% [37/201] vs 20.0% [34/170], p = 0.80). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated no significant differences in hospitalization (adj OR 1.12, CI: 0.90-1.38), ICU admission (adj OR: 1.31, CI: 0.82-2.10), need for mechanical ventilation (adj OR 1.65, CI: 0.69-4.02), or mortality (OR: 0.80, CI: 0.43-1.49). In conclusion, ICS therapy did not increase COVID-19 related healthcare utilization or mortality outcome in patients with COPD followed at the Cleveland Clinic health system. These findings should encourage clinicians to continue ICS therapy for COPD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic."
7435,Exposure Profile of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Canadian Food Sources.,"Abstract: A new coronavirus strain known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide. This virus is the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission via infected droplets and aerosols generated by infected persons. Although COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, the potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via food is considered theoretically possible and remains a concern for Canadian consumers. We have conducted an exposure assessment of the likelihood of exposure of SARS-CoV-2 in Canadian food sources at the time of consumption. This article describes the exposure routes considered most relevant in the context of food contamination with SARS-CoV-2, including contaminated food of animal origin, other contaminated fresh foods, fomites, and SARS-CoV-2-contaminated feces. The likelihood of foodborne infection of SARS-CoV-2 via the human digestive tract also was considered. Our analysis indicates that there is no evidence that foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred, and we consider the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 via food and food packaging in Canada as low to remote. Adherence to safe food practices and cleaning procedures would in any case prevent a potential foodborne infection with SARS-CoV-2."
7436,Identification of the RNase-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for anchor primer-PCR detection of viral loading in 306 COVID-19 patients.,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) urgently calls for more sensitive molecular diagnosis to improve sensitivity of current viral nuclear acid detection. We have developed an anchor primer (AP)-based assay to improve viral RNA stability by bioinformatics identification of RNase-binding site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and implementing AP dually targeting the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNase 1, 3, 6. The arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) improvement of viral RNA integrity was supported by (a) the AP increased resistance of the targeted gene (N gene) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to RNase treatment; (b) the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by AP-PCR with lower cycle threshold values (-2.7 cycles) compared to two commercially available assays; (c) improvement of the viral RNA stability of the ORF gene upon targeting of the N gene and RNase. Furthermore, the improved sensitivity by AP-PCR was demonstrated by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 70-80% of sputum, nasal, pharyngeal swabs and feces and 36% (4/11) of urine of the confirmed cases (n = 252), 7% convalescent cases (n = 54) and none of 300 negative cases. Lastly, AP-PCR analysis of 306 confirmed and convalescent cases revealed prolonged presence of viral loading for >20 days after the first positive diagnosis. Thus, the AP dually targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNase improves molecular detection by preserving SARS-CoV-2 RNA integrity and reveals the prolonged viral loading associated with older age and male gender in COVID-19 patients."
7437,"Prevalence of COVID-19 in 10,000 samples from 7853 patients in Eastern Turkey by positive real-time PCR.","Aim: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, started in December 2019 and has spread across the world. Materials & methods: We analyzed real-time PCR results of 10,000 samples from 2 April to 30 May 2020 in three neighbor cities located in the East of Turkey. The final study population was 7853 cases, after excluding screening tests. Results: Real-time PCR was performed to detect the SARS-CoV-2-specific RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase gene fragment. The number of total positive samples out of 7853 were 487; however, the number of nonrepeating positive patient was 373 (4.8%). Cough and fever were the most common symptoms in positive cases. Conclusion: Epidemiologic studies should be performed about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection to better understand the effect of the virus across the world."

7439,"Impact of COVID-19 on the Gut: A Review of the Manifestations, Pathology, Management, and Challenges.","SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that can enter its hosts through the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is mainly expressed in cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophageal epithelium and enterocytes from the ileum-colon. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has varying clinical symptoms and presents differently in individuals, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to moderate clinical spectrum with mild pneumonia clinical features, and to a severe clinical presentation with dyspnea and hypoxia, leading to death due to respiratory or multi-organ failure. COVID-19 infection can also manifest themselves in the form of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. Severe complications of gastrointestinal COVID-19 infections include hemorrhage or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract and severe inflammation, which can adversely affect the intestinal immune system, and therefore the systemic immune system of the host. Furthermore, COVID-19 has also shown to affect microbiota homeostasis in the digestive tract. To date, no clear explanation is available regarding the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection, fecal RNA detection, and the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to discuss the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the digestive tract, microbiota, and lung, and the possibility of fecal-oral transmission in COVID-19."
