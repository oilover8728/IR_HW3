9740,SARS-CoV-2 and immune-microbiome interactions: Lessons from respiratory viral infections.,"By the beginning of 2020, infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had rapidly evolved into an emergent worldwide pandemic, an outbreak whose unprecedented consequences highlighted many existing flaws within public healthcare systems across the world. While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is bestowed with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, involving the vital organs, the respiratory system transpires as the main route of entry for SARS-CoV-2, with the lungs being its primary target. Of those infected, up to 20% require hospitalization on account of severity, while the majority of patients are either asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms. Exacerbation in the disease severity and complications of COVID-19 infection have been associated with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and chronic lung disease. Interestingly, a recent body of evidence indicated the pulmonary and gut microbiomes as potential modulators for altering the course of COVID-19, potentially via the microbiome-immune system axis. While the relative concordance between microbes and immunity has yet to be fully elucidated with regards to COVID-19, we present an overview of our current understanding of COVID-19-microbiome-immune cross talk and discuss the potential contributions of microbiome-related immunity to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and COVID-19 disease progression."

9742,SARS-CoV-2 Viability on 16 Common Indoor Surface Finish Materials.,"Aim: This study investigated the stability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on 16 common environmental surface materials. Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of severe coronavirus disease, a significant public health concern that quickly led to a pandemic. Contamination of environmental surface materials is of concern, with previous studies identifying long-term detection of infectious particles on surfaces. These contaminated surfaces create an increased risk for contact transmission. Methods: Surface materials were inoculated with 10,000 plaque forming units and samples were collected 4, 8, 12, 24, 30, 48, and 168 hours post infection (hpi). Viral titers were determined for each sample and time point using plaque assays. Nonparametric modeling utilized the Turnbull algorithm for interval-censored data. Maximum likelihood estimates for the survival curve were calculated. Parametric proportional hazards regression models for interval censored data were used to explore survival time across the surface materials. Results: There was a sharp decline in recoverable virus after 4 hpi for all tested surfaces. By 12 hpi, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was recoverable from only four surfaces; and by 30 hr, the virus was recoverable from only one surface. There were differences in survival curves based on the materials although some groups of materials are similar, both statistically and practically. Conclusions: While very low amounts of infectious SARS-CoV-2 are recoverable over time, there remains a risk of viral transmission by surface contamination in indoor environments. Individuals and institutions must follow appropriate procedures to decontaminate indoor environment and increase diligence for hand hygiene and personal protective equipment."

9744,The Correlation between Psychiatric Disorders and COVID-19: A Narrative Review.,"Since December 2019, the havoc caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has increased exponentially in a short period of time. As the COVID-19 pandemic is raging around the world, scientists are trying to reveal its mysteriousness. Although COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and fatigue, but extrapulmonary manifestations are increasingly recognized. Recent studies have shown that there is a strong genetic correlation between one or more psychiatric disorders and the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Historical epidemiological perspectives and recent neurobiological evidence link infection and psychosis. What is the relationship between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorders? In this article, we will review the correlation between COVID-19 and psychoses, the possible reasons, and the possible pathophysiological mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference for clinicians to make correct judgment and treatment when facing patients with COVID-19 and/or psychiatric disorders."
9745,Functional interrogation of a SARS-CoV-2 host protein interactome identifies unique and shared coronavirus host factors.,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has devastated the global economy and claimed more than 1.7 million lives, presenting an urgent global health crisis. To identify host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen SARS-CoV-2 at two physiologically relevant temperatures along with three related coronaviruses (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E], HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution than genome-scale studies. This approach yielded several insights, including potential virus-specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug development efforts aimed at intercepting and treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks."
9746,SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 Has about Twofold Replicative Advantage and Acquires Concerning Mutations.,"The novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC)-202012/01 (also known as B.1.1.7), first collected in United Kingdom on 20 September 2020, is a rapidly growing lineage that in January 2021 constituted 86% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in England. The VOC has been detected in 40 out of 46 countries that reported at least 50 genomes in January 2021. We have estimated that the replicative advantage of the VOC is in the range 1.83-2.18 [95% CI: 1.71-2.40] with respect to the 20A.EU1 variant that dominated in England in November 2020, and in range 1.65-1.72 [95% CI: 1.46-2.04] in Wales, Scotland, Denmark, and USA. As the VOC strain will likely spread globally towards fixation, it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. We have estimated growth rates of expanding mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that the L18F substitution in spike has initiated a fast growing VOC substrain. The L18F substitution is of significance because it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. Of concern are immune escape mutations acquired by the VOC: E484K, F490S, S494P (in the receptor binding motif of spike) and Q677H, Q675H (in the proximity of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary). These mutants may hinder efficiency of existing vaccines and expand in response to the increasing after-infection or vaccine-induced seroprevalence."
9747,A narrative review of COVID-19: magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate as a potential adjuvant treatment.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic affecting more than 200 countries with 87 million patients worldwide as of January 7, 2021. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates in a large amount and reaches high-titer levels in a short time after the infection. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 shows clinical symptoms mainly including fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. In more severe COVID-19 patients, viral pneumonia characterized by bilateral ground glass or patchy opacity, may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, multi-organ damage, and even death. Unfortunately, there is no effective therapy for COVID-19 until now. Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG), a magnesium salt of 18-Î± glycyrrhizic acid stereoisomer, belongs to the fourth generation of glycyrrhizic acid preparation. MgIG has various pharmacological activities including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-virus, and immunoregulation, showing the protection against the injury of the vital organs (such as kidney, heart, and lung). Clinically, MgIG injection is usually used as a hepatoprotective agent to treat liver diseases. This narrative review summarizes the research and application of MgIG, and provides the evidence supporting the recommended MgIG as supportive therapy in the ""Management Standard for Mild and Common Patients of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Second Edition)"", which is jointly issued by National Health Commission of People's Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine."
9748,Molecular Insights into Small-Molecule Drug Discovery for SARS-CoV-2.,"The mainstream approach to antiviral drugs against COVID-19 is to focus on key stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. The vast majority of candidates under investigation are repurposed from agents of other indications. Understanding protein-inhibitor interactions at the molecular scale will provide crucial insights for drug discovery to stop this pandemic. In this article, we summarize and analyze the most recent structural data on several viral targets in the presence of promising inhibitors for COVID-19 in the context of the perspective of modes of action (MOA) to unravel insightful mechanistic features with atomistic resolution. The targets include spike glycoprotein and various host proteases mediating the entry of the virus into the cells, viral chymotrypsin- and papain-like proteases, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The main purpose of this review is to present detailed MOA analysis to inspire fresh ideas for both de novo drug design and optimization of known scaffolds to combat COVID-19."
9749,Lithium as a candidate treatment for COVID-19: Promises and pitfalls.,"The pandemic of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-nCoV-2) is a global health crisis. Despite numerous preliminary results, there is as yet no treatment of proven efficacy for this condition. In this context, the pharmacological properties of lithium, better known as a treatment for mood disorders, merit closer examination. Lithium has shown in vitro efficacy at inhibiting the replication of coronaviruses responsible for gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in animals. It has immunomodulatory properties that may be of additional benefit in moderating the host inflammatory response to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, there is evidence that lithium may exert a protective action against upper respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses in patients taking it for other indications. These promising reports must be balanced against the narrow therapeutic index and high risk of toxicity associated with lithium therapy, its documented interactions with several commonly used drugs, and the absence of evidence of its efficacy against coronaviruses responsible for human disease. Nevertheless, naturalistic studies of the risk of COVID-19 in patients already receiving lithium could provide indirect evidence of its efficacy, and understanding the putative antiviral and immune-regulatory mechanisms of lithium in models of SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide leads for the development of safer and more effective treatments with a specific action against COVID-19."
