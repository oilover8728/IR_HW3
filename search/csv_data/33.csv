320,Different Strategies for the Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Variants in the Laboratory Practice.,"A considerable effort has been devoted in all countries to react to the COVID-19 pandemic by tracing infected individuals, containing the spread of the disease, identifying therapies, and producing and distributing vaccines. Currently, a significant concern is the appearance of variants of the virus that may frustrate these efforts by showing increased transmissibility, increased disease severity, reduced response to therapy or vaccines, and ability to escape diagnosis. All countries have therefore devoted a massive attempt to the identification and tracking of these variants, which requires a vast technological effort to sequence a large number of viral genomes. In this paper, we report our experience as one of the Italian laboratories involved in SARS-CoV-2 variant tracing. We summarize the different approaches used, and outline a potential model combining several techniques to increase tracing ability while at the same time minimizing costs."
321,Diagnostic accuracy of Panbio rapid antigen tests on oropharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 offer new opportunities for testing in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the reference sample type, but oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) may be a more acceptable sample type in some patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective study in a single screening center to assess the diagnostic performance of the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) on OPS compared with reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using NPS during the second pandemic wave in Switzerland. Results: 402 outpatients were enrolled in a COVID-19 screening center, of whom 168 (41.8%) had a positive RT-qPCR test. The oropharyngeal Ag-RDT clinical sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal RT-qPCR was 81% (95%CI: 74.2-86.6). Two false positives were noted out of the 234 RT-qPCR negative individuals, which resulted in a clinical specificity of 99.1% (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) for the Ag-RDT. For cycle threshold values ≤ 26.7 (≥ 1E6 SARS-CoV-2 genomes copies/mL, a presumed cut-off for infectious virus), 96.3% sensitivity (95%CI: 90.7-99.0%) was obtained with the Ag-RDT using OPS. Interpretation: Based on our findings, the diagnostic performance of the Panbio™ Covid-19 RDT with OPS samples, if taken by a trained person and high requirements regarding quality of the specimen, meet the criteria required by the WHO for Ag-RDTs (sensitivity ≥80% and specificity ≥97%) in a high incidence setting in symptomatic individuals."
322,Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Antibody Detection Results for SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Background: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of virus nucleic acid test (NAT) has become the standard method to diagnose severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, there are still many limitations, especially the problem of the high false negative rate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 NAT and evaluate the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody detection in novel coronavirus infection. Methods: A total of 10309 suspected or high-risk cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Hubei, China, were tested for virus NAT by RT-PCR. Among those cases, 762 COVID-19 patients and 143 patients with non-COVID-19 who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG during the NAT period were screened. The difference between the two test methods was analyzed using the chi-square test. Results: The positive rate of 10309 cases was about 36% (95% CI: 33.39%-39.67%). SARS-CoV-2 was present in various types of specimens, and alveolar lavage fluid had the highest positive rate [52.38% (95% CI: 31.02-73.74)]. The clinical sensitivity of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG was 77.17% (588/762) and 94.88% (723/762), respectively, and the clinical specificity was 93.71% (134/143) and 90.21% (129/143). The area under the curve (AUC) of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and combination of IgG with IgM were equally larger than IgM [0.973 (95% CI: 0.964-0.983) vs 0.930 (95% CI: 0.910-0.949)]. IgG antibody had the highest specificity [100.0% (95% CI: 100.00%-100.00%)] and sensitivity [94.0% (95% CI: 92.45%-95.55%)] when detected alone or in combination with IgM antibody. The total coincidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection and SARS-CoV-2 NAT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 92.04% (833/905). Among the 34 SARS-CoV-2 NAT-negative patients with clinical symptoms and CT imaging features, 29 (85.29%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and 31 (91.76%) were positive for IgG. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 NAT should be considered for many types of specimens, and the combined test of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG can make up for the problem of missed NAT in COVID-19 patients."
323,Pooling of samples to optimize SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-qPCR: comparative analysis of two protocols.,"This study has aimed to evaluate the use pool of samples as a strategy to optimize the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. A total of 220 naso/orofaryngeal swab samples were collected and tested using two different protocols of sample pooling. Results from protocol A were identical with the individual results. However, for results from protocol B, reduced agreement (91%) was observed in relation to individual testing. Inconsistencies observed were related to RT-qPCR results with higher cycle thresholds. These results suggest that pooling of samples before RNA extraction is preferable in terms of diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2."

325,The detection dogs test is more sensitive than real-time PCR in screening for SARS-CoV-2.,"In January 2020, the coronavirus disease was declared, by the World Health Organization as a global public health emergency. Recommendations from the WHO COVID Emergency Committee continue to support strengthening COVID surveillance systems, including timely access to effective diagnostics. Questions were raised about the validity of considering the RT-PCR as the gold standard in COVID-19 diagnosis. It has been suggested that a variety of methods should be used to evaluate advocated tests. Dogs had been successfully trained and employed to detect diseases in humans. Here we show that upon training explosives detection dogs on sniffing COVID-19 odor in patients' sweat, those dogs were able to successfully screen out 3249 individuals who tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2, from a cohort of 3290 individuals. Additionally, using Bayesian analysis, the sensitivity of the K9 test was found to be superior to the RT-PCR test performed on nasal swabs from a cohort of 3134 persons. Given its high sensitivity, short turn-around-time, low cost, less invasiveness, and ease of application, the detection dogs test lends itself as a better alternative to the RT-PCR in screening for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals."
326,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Oral Fluid Obtained Using a Rapid Collection Device.,Current commercially available methods for reliably detecting antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain expensive and inaccessible due to the need for whole-blood collection by highly trained phlebotomists using personal protective equipment (PPE). We have evaluated an antibody detection approach using the OraSure Technologies oral antibody collection device (OACD) and their proprietary SARS-CoV-2 total antibody detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the OraSure test for total antibody detection in oral fluid had comparable sensitivity and specificity to commercially available serum-based ELISAs for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection while allowing for a more accessible form of specimen collection with the potential for self-collection.
327,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies using High-Throughput Fluorescent Imaging of Pseudovirus Infection.,"As the COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve, it has become evident that the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the virus may provide protection against future infection. Thus, as the creation and translation of effective COVID-19 vaccines continues at an unprecedented speed, the development of fast and effective methods to measure neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will become increasingly important to determine long-term protection against infection for both previously infected and immunized individuals. This paper describes a high-throughput protocol using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to measure the presence of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent serum from patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19. The use of a replicating pseudotyped virus eliminates the necessity for a containment level 3 facility required for SARS-CoV-2 handling, making this protocol accessible to virtually any containment level 2 lab. The use of a 96-well format allows for many samples to be run at the same time with a short turnaround time of 24 h."
328,Correlation of SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies to an Automated Chemiluminescent Serological Immunoassay.,"Introduction: Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are capable of binding to a virus to render it incapable of infection. The ability of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests to detect NAbs has not been widely reported. We sought to correlate the antibodies detected by an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay with NAbs. Methods: Residual serum samples from 35 patients that had a positive antibody test using the LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay and 2 antibody-negative control sera were tested for NAbs using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Results: NAbs were detected in 66% (23/35) of the antibody-positive samples. The immunoassay signal value ranged from 21.7 to 131.3 AU/mL (median, 90.5) with significant correlation between it and the PRNT (r = 0.61, P = 0.002). In the samples without NAbs, the immunoassay signal ranged from 16.3 to 66.2 AU/mL (median, 27.2). An immunoassay signal cutoff of >41 AU/mL was 91% sensitive and 92% specific for the detection of NAbs. Discussion: It is important that correlates of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 be identified and NAbs are considered to be central indicators of such. PRNT is the gold-standard test for identifying NAbs but it cannot be used for large-scale testing of populations. It is necessary to establish relationships between it and widely used commercial serological assays for SARS-CoV-2."
329,Role of rapid antibody and ELISA tests in the evaluation of serological response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity.,"From 7 to 8 days after the onset of symptoms in COVID-19 infection, the sensitivity of serological tests was found to be higher than that of nucleic acid tests. The aims of this study were to investigate antibody levels in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to examine the relationship between antibody levels and virus load, and to evaluate the performance of 2 different commercial kits. A total of 103 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples taken from patients were investigated simultaneously with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs (Euroimmun) and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG/IgM (Deep Blue) kits. No positivity was detected with any of the test kits in 18 (17.4%) of the 103 samples. In symptomatic patients, 100% of IgM and IgA tests were found to be positive in the group sampled after 10 days, while 100% of IgG tests were found positive after 20 days. The sensitivity of the Deep Blue COVID-19 IgG antibody kit was calculated as 81.48% and the specificity was 97.96%. While there was no statistically significant difference between the PCR CT and ELISA OD values, a positive correlation was found between the ELISA OD values and the days since the date of symptom initiation. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antibody test used in this study were found to be quite high. In conditions where ELISA tests cannot be applied, it is thought that it can give an idea in terms of the presence of antibodies as a simple and fast test. Although ELISA tests are valuable in the diagnosis of COVID-19 during the acute period, they are tests that can be used safely in the diagnosis of previous infections and seroepidemiological studies."
