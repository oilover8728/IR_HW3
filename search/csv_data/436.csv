4350,"Neonatal Outcomes in Pregnant Women Infected with COVID-19 in Babol, North of Iran: A Retrospective Study with Short-Term Follow-Up.","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of pregnant women and neonates suffering from COVID-19 increased. However, there is a lack of evidence on clinical characteristics and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. We evaluated short-term outcomes (4 weeks postdischarge) and symptoms in neonates born to mothers infected with COVID-19. In this retrospective cohort study, we included all neonates born to pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to Ayatollah Rohani Hospital, Babol, Iran, from February 10 to May 20, 2020. Clinical features, treatments, and neonatal outcomes were measured. Eight neonates were included in the current study. The mean gestational age and birth weight of newborns were 37 ± 3.19 weeks (30₊6-40) and 3077.50 ± 697.64 gr (1720-3900), respectively. Apgar score of the first and fifth minutes in all neonates was ≥8 and ≥9 out of 10, respectively. The most clinical presentations in symptomatic neonates were respiratory distress, tachypnea, vomiting, and feeding intolerance. This manifestation and high levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in three infants are common in neonatal sepsis. The blood culture in all of them was negative. They have been successfully treated with our standard treatment. Our pregnant women showed a pattern of clinical characteristics and laboratory results similar to those described for nonpregnant COVID-19 infection. This study found no evidence of intrauterine or peripartum transmission of COVID-19 from mother to her child. Furthermore, the long-term outcomes of neonates need more study."

4352,"Expression, purification and immunological characterization of recombinant nucleocapsid protein fragment from SARS-CoV-2.","Serological testing is important method for diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Nucleocapsid (N) protein is the most abundant virus derived protein and strong immunogen. We aimed to find its efficient, low-cost production. SARS-CoV-2 recombinant fragment of nucleocapsid protein (rfNP; 58-419 aa) was expressed in E. coli in soluble form, purified and characterized biochemically and immunologically. Purified rfNP has secondary structure of full-length recombinant N protein, with high percentage of disordered structure (34.2%) and of β-sheet (40.7%). rfNP was tested in immunoblot using sera of COVID-19 convalescent patients. ELISA was optimized with sera of RT-PCR confirmed positive symptomatic patients and healthy individuals. IgG detection sensitivity was 96% (47/50) and specificity 97% (67/68), while IgM detection was slightly lower (94% and 96.5%, respectively). Cost-effective approach for soluble recombinant N protein fragment production was developed, with reliable IgG and IgM antibodies detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
4353,Analyzing disparities in COVID-19 testing trends according to risk for COVID-19 severity across New York City.,"Background: Given the interplay between race and comorbidities on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, it is vital that testing be performed in areas of greatest need, where more severe cases are expected. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate COVID-19 testing data in NYC relative to risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and demographic characteristics of NYC neighborhoods. Methods: COVID-19 testing and the racial/ethnic composition of NYC Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) were obtained from the NYC Coronavirus data repository and the American Community Survey, respectively. The prevalence of neighborhood-level risk factors for COVID-19 severity according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for risk of severe illness and complications from COVID-19 were used to create a ZCTA-level risk index. Poisson regressions were performed to study the ratio of total tests relative to the total ZCTA population and the proportion of positive tests relative to the total tests performed over time. Results: From March 2nd-April 6th, the total tests/population (%) was positively associated with the proportion of white residents (IRRadj: 1.0003, 95% CI: 1.0003-1.0004) and the COVID risk index (IRRadj: 1.038, 95% CI: 1.029-1.046). The risk index (IRRadj: 1.017, 95% CI: 0.939-1.101) was not associated with total tests performed from April 6th-May 12th, and inversely associated from May 12th-July 6th (IRRadj: 0.862, 95% CI: 0.814-0.913). From March 2nd-April 6th the COVID risk index was not statistically associated (IRRadj: 1.010, 95% CI: 0.987-1.034) with positive tests/total tests. From April 6th-May 12th, the COVID risk index was positively associated (IRRadj: 1.031, 95% CI: 1.002-1.060), while from May 12th-July 6th, the risk index was inversely associated (IRRadj: 1.135, 95% CI: 1.042-1.237) with positivity. Conclusions: Testing in NYC has suffered from the lack of availability in high-risk populations, and was initially limited as a diagnostic tool for those with severe symptoms, which were mostly concentrated in areas where vulnerable residents live. Subsequent time periods of testing were not targeted in areas according to COVID-19 disease risk, as these areas still experience more positive tests."
4354,Optimal planning of the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain.,"This work presents a novel framework to simultaneously address the optimal planning of COVID-19 vaccine supply chains and the optimal planning of daily vaccinations in the available vaccination centres. A new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to generate optimal decisions regarding the transferred quantities between locations, the inventory profiles of central hubs and vaccination centres and the daily vaccination plans in the vaccination centres of the supply chain network. Specific COVID-19 characteristics, such as special cold storage technologies, limited shelf-life of mRNA vaccines in refrigerated conditions and demanding vaccination targets under extreme time pressure, are aptly modelled. The goal of the model is the minimization of total costs, including storage and transportation costs, costs related to fleet and staff requirements, as well as, indirect costs imposed by wasted doses. A two-step decomposition strategy based on a divide-and-conquer and an aggregation approach is proposed for the solution of large-scale problems. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed optimization-based framework is illustrated on a study case that simulates the Greek nationwide vaccination program. Finally, a rolling horizon technique is employed to reactively deal with possible disturbances in the vaccination plans. The proposed mathematical framework facilitates the decision-making process in COVID-19 vaccine supply chains into minimizing the underlying costs and the number of doses lost. As a result, the efficiency of the distribution network is improved, thus assisting the mass vaccination campaigns against COVID-19."

To reduce the additional loss of millions of lives until natural immunity is reached, researchers have focused on the only known method to stop the COVID-19 pandemic: vaccines. The pandemic has propelled high-speed vaccine development, some based on novel technology previously not utilized in the vaccine field. The new technology opens new possibilities and comes with challenges because the long-term performance of the new platforms is unknown. Here we review the current leading vaccine candidates against COVID-19 and outline the advantages and disadvantages as well as the unknowns of each candidate."

4359,Navigating Kidney Transplantation in the Early Phase of Coronavirus Disease 2019: Screening Patients With Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and Low-Radiation-Dose Chest Computed Tomography.,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of 2020 changed organ transplantation. All elective cases at our institution were postponed for approximately 3 months. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services considers organ transplant surgery a Tier 3b case, along with other high acuity procedures, recommending no postponement. Our transplant program collaborated with our transplant infectious disease colleagues to create a protocol that would ensure both patient and staff safety during these unprecedented times. Methods: The living donor program was electively placed on hold until we had the proper protocols in place. Preoperative COVID-19 testing was required for all recipients and living donors. All patients underwent a rapid nasopharyngeal swab test. After testing negative by nasopharyngeal swab, recipients also underwent a low-radiation-dose computed tomography scan to rule out any radiographic changes suggestive of a COVID-19 infection. Results: We performed 8 living donor and 9 deceased donor kidney transplants. In comparison, we performed 10 living donor and 4 deceased donor transplants during the same time period in the previous year. Our testing protocol enabled efficient use of all suitable organs offered during the viral pandemic. No recipients or living donors tested positive or developed COVID-19. Conclusions: Creation of a viral testing protocol, developed in conjunction with our infectious disease team, permitted kidney transplantation to be performed safely, and the number of deceased donor transplants increased considerably without adversely affecting our outcomes."
