6350,Socio-Demographics Correlate of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy During the Second Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Web-Based Survey in Saudi Arabia.,"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is considered a major global public health threat affecting across the life course and socioeconomic aspects of life. Global acceptance to an effective vaccine is the most anticipated resolution. This study aims to evaluate intent to be vaccinated among public in Saudi Arabia during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based study was designed in Saudi Arabia. Study participants (N = 658) were recruited through snowball sampling. The SurveyMonkey platform was used to record the response. Cross-tabulation was performed by participants' intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 virus with sociodemographic characteristics and respondents' risk perception toward COVID-19, trust in the healthcare system, and their history of vaccine hesitancy behavior. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to compute the predictors of vaccination intention among the study participants. Results: Six hundred fifty-eight participants completed the survey (females = 47.4%). Of the 658 participants, 351 (53.3%) have shown intent to be vaccinated. Five hundred nineteen (78.8%) of the participants were reported to be at high risk of COVID-19, and 307 (46.6%) were reported to trust the healthcare system in the country. The multivariable analysis shows respondents with a high-risk perception (OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.49-3.48); higher trust in the healthcare system (OR: 3.24, 95% CI: 2.32-4.61) was found to be the significant factor affecting the decision in acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. Conclusion: Participants reported high knowledge toward COVID-19 virus, and vaccine developments. About half (46.6%) of the study participants reported refusal/hesitancy toward the vaccine during the second wave of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The study highlighted that higher risk perception and higher trust in the healthcare system were found to be the main reasons for participants' intentions behind the vaccination."
6351,Plant-based vaccines and antibodies to combat COVID-19: current status and prospects.,"Globally, researchers are undertaking significant efforts to design and develop effective vaccines, therapeutics, and antiviral drugs to curb the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Plants have been used for the production of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory proteins, drugs, and pharmaceuticals via molecular farming/transient expression system and are considered as bioreactors or factories for their bulk production. These biological products are stable, safe, effective, easily available, and affordable. Plant molecular farming could facilitate rapid production of biologics on an industrial scale, and has the potential to fulfill emergency demands, such as in the present situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article aims to describe the methodology and basics of plant biopharming, in addition to its prospective applications for developing effective vaccines and antibodies to counter COVID-19."
6352,[Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in paediatrics : what is the evidence to date?].,"Although SARS-CoV-2 infects individuals of all ages, children show less severe symptoms. Nevertheless, the very rare COVID-19 severe cases in paediatrics require our full attention. Much research has been conducted and is still ongoing on effective treatments. On the antiviral front, no molecule has been proven effective yet and the results of several studies on the benefit of monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma are pending. On the side of immunomodulators, the benefit of steroids has been demonstrated for patients severely ill. Other molecules are being investigated. However, all these studies focused on adults and paediatric data are warranted."
6353,Preclinical efficacy and safety analysis of gamma-irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.,"COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 created an unprecedented health crisis since there is no vaccine for this novel virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have become crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality. In this study, in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy analyzes of lyophilized vaccine candidates inactivated by gamma-irradiation were performed. The candidate vaccines in this study were OZG-3861 version 1 (V1), an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, and SK-01 version 1 (V1), a GM-CSF adjuvant added vaccine. The candidate vaccines were applied intradermally to BALB/c mice to assess toxicity and immunogenicity. Preliminary results in vaccinated mice are reported in this study. Especially, the vaccine models containing GM-CSF caused significant antibody production with neutralization capacity in absence of the antibody-dependent enhancement feature, when considered in terms of T and B cell responses. Another important finding was that the presence of adjuvant was more important in T cell in comparison with B cell response. Vaccinated mice showed T cell response upon restimulation with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or peptide pool. This study shows that the vaccines are effective and leads us to start the challenge test to investigate the gamma-irradiated inactivated vaccine candidates for infective SARS-CoV-2 virus in humanized ACE2 + mice."
6354,Coverage and Estimated Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among US Veterans.,"Importance: Effectiveness of mRNA vaccinations in a diverse older population with high comorbidity is unknown. Objectives: To describe the scope of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout among US veterans, and to estimate mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) as measured by rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, setting, and participants: This matched test-negative case-control study was conducted using SARS-CoV-2 test results at Veterans Health Administration sites from December 14, 2020, to March 14, 2021. Vaccine coverage was estimated for all veterans. VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and death were estimated using electronic health records from veterans who routinely sought care at a VHA facility and had a test result positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases) or negative for SARS-CoV-2 (controls). Cases and controls were matched on time of test and geographic region. Data were analyzed from May to July 2021. Exposures: Vaccination status, defined as unvaccinated, partially vaccinated (≥14 days after first dose until second dose), or fully vaccinated (≥14 days after second dose), at time of test. Main outcomes and measures: The main outcome of interest was a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on a polymerase chain reaction or antigen test. Secondary outcomes included COVID-19-related hospitalization and death, defined by discharge data and proximity of event to positive test result. VE was estimated from odds ratios for SARS-CoV-2 infection with 95% CIs. Results: Among 6 647 733 veterans included (3 350 373 veterans [50%] aged ≥65 years; 6 014 798 [90%] men and 632 935 [10%] women; 461 645 Hispanic veterans of any race [7%], 1 102 471 non-Hispanic Black veterans [17%], and 4 361 621 non-Hispanic White veterans [66%]), 1 363 180 (21%) received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccination by March 7, 2021. In this period, during which the share of SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Epsilon, and Iota had started to increase in the US, estimates of COVID-19 VE against infection, regardless of symptoms, was 95% (95% CI, 93%-96%) for full vaccination and 64% (95% CI, 59%-68%) for partial vaccination. Estimated VE against COVID-19-related hospitalization for full vaccination was 91% (95% CI 83%-95%); there were no deaths among veterans who were fully vaccinated. VE against infection was similar across subpopulations (non-Hispanic Black, 94% [95% CI, 88%-97%]; Hispanic [any race], 83% [95% CI, 45%-95%]; non-Hispanic White, 92% [95% CI 88%-94%]; rural, 94% [95% CI, 89%-96%]; urban, 93% 95% CI, 89%-95%]). Conclusions and relevance: For veterans of all racial and ethnic subgroups living in urban or rural areas, mRNA vaccination was associated with substantially decreased risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization, with no deaths among fully vaccinated veterans."
6355,Optimal strategies for social distancing and testing to control COVID-19.,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected more than 79 million individuals, with 1.7 million deaths worldwide. Several countries have implemented social distancing and testing policies with contact tracing as a measure to flatten the curve of the ongoing pandemic. Optimizing these control measures is urgent given the substantial societal and economic impacts associated with infection and interventions. To determine the optimal social distancing and testing strategies, we developed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and applied optimal control theory, identifying the best approach to reduce the epidemiological burden of COVID-19 at a minimal cost. The results demonstrate that testing as a standalone optimal strategy does not have a significant effect on the final size of an epidemic, but it would delay the peak of the pandemic. If social distancing is the sole control strategy, it would be optimal to gradually increase the level of social distancing as the incidence curve of COVID-19 grows, and relax the measures after the curve has reached its peak. Compared with a single strategy, combined social distancing and testing strategies are demonstrated to be more efficient at reducing the disease burden, and they can delay the peak of the disease. To optimize these strategies, testing should be maintained at a maximum level in the early phases and after the peak of the epidemic, whereas social distancing should be intensified when the prevalence of the disease is greater than 15%. Accordingly, public health agencies should implement early testing and switch to social distancing when the incidence level begins to increase. After the peak of the pandemic, it would be optimal to gradually relax social distancing and switch back to testing."
6356,Emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Netherlands.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged in December 2019 when the first case was reported in Wuhan, China and turned into a pandemic with 27 million (September 9th) cases. Currently, there are over 95,000 complete genome sequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, in public databases, accompanying a growing number of studies. Nevertheless, there is still much to learn about the viral population variation when the virus is evolving as it continues to spread. We have analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify the most variant sites, as well as the stable, conserved ones in samples collected in the Netherlands until June 2020. We identified the most frequent mutations in different geographies. We also performed a phylogenetic study focused on the Netherlands to detect novel variants emerging in the late stages of the pandemic and forming local clusters. We investigated the S and N proteins on SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Netherlands and found the most variant and stable sites to guide development of diagnostics assays and vaccines. We observed that while the SARS-CoV-2 genome has accumulated mutations, diverging from reference sequence, the variation landscape is dominated by four mutations globally, suggesting the current reference does not represent the virus samples circulating currently. In addition, we detected novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 almost unique to the Netherlands that form localized clusters and region-specific sub-populations indicating community spread. We explored SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Netherlands until June 2020 within a global context; our results provide insight into the viral population diversity for localized efforts in tracking the transmission of COVID-19, as well as sequenced-based approaches in diagnostics and therapeutics. We emphasize that little diversity is observed globally in recent samples despite the increased number of mutations relative to the established reference sequence. We suggest sequence-based analyses should opt for a consensus representation to adequately cover the genomic variation observed to speed up diagnostics and vaccine design."
6357,Calling for an exponential escalation scheme in vaccine development for COVID-19.,"Purpose: COVID-19 as a pandemic calls for rapid development of vaccines. Methods: Here a proposal of a seamless, adaptive, phase 1-3 trial for accelerated vaccine development is described. Results: Starting at 10, the number of vaccinated volunteers would exponentially increase by tenfold at an interval of 2 weeks; close surveillance of antibody responses, safety and efficacy is necessary. After only 16 weeks, general vaccination would be feasible if supply meets the demand. Conclusion: A COVID-19 vaccine would be rapidly available at a slightly increased risk for undetected late side effects or insufficient efficacy if compared with standard vaccine development schemes."
6358,"Assessment of Potential Risk Factors for 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Infection among Health Care Workers in a Tertiary Care Hospital, North India.","Introduction: Health care workers (HCWs) are at the forefront to fight against COVID-19 pandemic. They are at more risk of contracting the infection. This study was planned to assess potential risk factors of 2019-novel coronavirus infection among HCWs working in a health facility and to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures among them. Methods: A study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital among HCWs who were directly or indirectly involved in the management of a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. The socio-demographic characteristics, history of exposure, IPC measures followed and clinical symptoms were compared between health care workers in COVID and non-COVID areas. Results: Majority (45%) of HCWs were nurses, followed by hospital/sanitary/technical attendants (30%) and doctors (24%). Out of a total of 256 HCWs, 2% tested positive. Around 80% of HCWs had ever attended any IPC training. A statistically significant association was found between posting area of HCWs and their exposure to COVID patients (duration of exposure, PPE has worn by HCWs, direct contact of HCWs with the patient's material) and COVID positivity (P value <.001). Conclusion: If health care workers were trained and take adequate precautions then the risk of getting an infection is minimized."
6359,A Family Cluster of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Infection with Different Clinical Manifestations.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had been declared as a global pandemic by WHO. During the pandemic, a suspicion of COVID-19 infection could be found on patients presented with clinical symptoms of COVID-19. However, several new clinical symptoms of COVID-19 had also been reported recently. This caused difficulties to identify COVID-19 based on the clinical symptoms only. Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was absolutely needed to determine the correct diagnosis. We report a family cluster of COVID-19 with different clinical manifestations to show a potential COVID-19 transmission in person who has no symptoms initially but may develop symptoms later as the incubation period varies from 5-14 days. This asymptomatic person remains potential to transmit the virus. This report describes the epidemiological, clinical, radiological, laboratory findings, and different clinical manifestation of a family cluster of COVID-19 case in Indonesia. COVID-19 was transmitted from asymptomatic person in the incubation period."
