7510,Clinical application of Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.,"Background: The unsatisfactory accuracy and capacity of real time RT-PCR depends on several unavoidable reasons, which cannot meet the demands for COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: 206 serum samples were collected from patients who were treated in the General Hospital of the Central Theater Command of the PLA between January 18 and April 4, 2020. 270 serum samples from healthy blood donors were used as control. IgM and total antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). Results: Among the 206 patients, the positive rate of IgM and Ab were 149/206 (72.3 %) and 187/206 (90.8 %), respectively. And the specificity of IgM and Ab detection were 99.3 % and 98.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of CMIA for Ab detection was significantly higher than that of IgM. An increase of the positive rate and S/CO value for detecting IgM and Ab accompanied with the increasing of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) were observed. The positive rate of Ab detected by CMIA increased rapidly after 7 d.p.o., while that of IgM was obviously increased after 14 d.p.o.. In addition, the age and gender of these patients did not affect the seroconversion and titer of antibodies during the whole course. The disease-severity of patients had no effect on the seroconversion of antibodies. However, the critical patients possessed a much higher antibody titers than the no-critical cases after 14 d.p.o.. Conclusions: The CMIA can provide important complementation to nucleic acid assay and help to enhance the accuracy and capacity of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
7511,"Factors associated with hospitalization, invasive mechanical ventilation treatment and death among all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Norway: Prospective cohort study.","Aims: For everyone with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway, we studied whether age, sex, comorbidity, continent of birth and nursing home residency were risk factors for hospitalization, invasive mechanical ventilation treatment and death. Methods: Data for everyone who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway by end of June 2020 (N = 8569) were linked at the individual level to hospitalization, receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation treatment and death measured to end of July 2020. Underlying comorbidity was proxied by hospital-based in- or outpatient treatment during the two months before the SARS-CoV-2 test. Multivariable generalized linear models were used to assess risk ratios (RRs). Results: Risk of hospitalization was particularly high for elderly (for those aged 90 and above: RR 9.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.1-12.7; comparison group aged below 50), Norwegian residents born in Asia, Africa or Latin-America (RR 2.1; 95% CI 1.9-2.4; comparison group born in Norway), patients with underlying comorbidity (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4-1.8) and men (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.2-1.5). Men and residents born in Africa, Asia and Latin-America were also at higher risk of receiving ventilation treatment and dying, but the mortality risk was especially high for the elderly (for those aged 90 and above: RR 607.9; 95% CI 145.5-2540.1; comparison group aged below 50) and residents in nursing homes (RR 4.2; 95% CI 3.1-5.7). Conclusions: High age was the most important predictor of severe disease and death if infected with SARS-CoV-2, and nursing home residents were at particularly high risk of death."
7512,"D936Y and Other Mutations in the Fusion Core of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Heptad Repeat 1: Frequency, Geographical Distribution, and Structural Effect.","The crown of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is constituted by its spike (S) glycoprotein. S protein mediates the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. The ""fusion core"" of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) on S plays a crucial role in the virus infectivity, as it is part of a key membrane fusion architecture. While SARS-CoV-2 was becoming a global threat, scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at an impressive pace, both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional structures. On 15 February 2021, from the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in the GISAID resource, we collected 415,673 complete S protein sequences and identified all the mutations occurring in the HR1 fusion core. This is a 21-residue segment, which, in the post-fusion conformation of the protein, gives many strong interactions with the heptad repeat 2, bringing viral and cellular membranes in proximity for fusion. We investigated the frequency and structural effect of novel mutations accumulated over time in such a crucial region for the virus infectivity. Three mutations were quite frequent, occurring in over 0.1% of the total sequences. These were S929T, D936Y, and S949F, all in the N-terminal half of the HR1 fusion core segment and particularly spread in Europe and USA. The most frequent of them, D936Y, was present in 17% of sequences from Finland and 12% of sequences from Sweden. In the post-fusion conformation of the unmutated S protein, D936 is involved in an inter-monomer salt bridge with R1185. We investigated the effect of the D936Y mutation on the pre-fusion and post-fusion state of the protein by using molecular dynamics, showing how it especially affects the latter one."
7513,Rapid and low-cost sampling for detection of airborne SARS-CoV-2 in dehumidifier condensate.,"Airborne spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by infectious aerosol is all but certain. However, easily implemented approaches to assess the actual environmental threat are currently unavailable. We present a simple approach with the potential to rapidly provide information about the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the atmosphere at any location. We used a portable dehumidifier as a readily available and affordable tool to collect airborne virus in the condensate. The dehumidifiers were deployed in selected locations of a hospital ward with patients reporting flu-like symptoms which could possibly be due to COVID-19 over three separate periods of one week. Samples were analyzed frequently for both virus envelope protein and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In several samples across separate deployments, condensate from dehumidifiers tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens as confirmed using two independent assays. RNA was detected, but not attributable to SARS-CoV-2. We verified the ability of the dehumidifier to rapidly collect aerosolized sodium chloride. Our results point to a facile pool testing method to sample air in any location in the world and assess the presence and concentration of an infectious agent to obtain quantitative risk assessment of exposure, designate zones as ""hot spots"" and minimize the need for individual testing which may often be time consuming, expensive, and laborious."
7514,Cross-reactive Antibody Response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Infections.,"The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV but also has implications for immunogen design and vaccine development."

7516,Molecular diversity of coronavirus host cell entry receptors.,"Coronaviruses are a group of viruses causing disease in a wide range of animals, and humans. Since 2002, the successive emergence of bat-borne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 has reinforced efforts in uncovering the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms governing coronavirus cell tropism and interspecies transmission. Decades of studies have led to the discovery of a broad set of carbohydrate and protein receptors for many animal and human coronaviruses. As the main determinant of coronavirus entry, the spike protein binds to these receptors and mediates membrane fusion. Prone to mutations and recombination, spike evolution has been studied extensively. The interactions between spike proteins and their receptors are often complex and despite many advances in the field, there remains many unresolved questions concerning coronavirus tropism modification and cross-species transmission, potentially leading to delays in outbreak responses. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the need to address these outstanding issues in order to better anticipate new outbreaks. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in the field of coronavirus receptors emphasizing on the molecular and evolutionary processes that underlie coronavirus receptor usage and host range expansion."
7517,Artificial Intelligence and Medical Internet of Things Framework for Diagnosis of Coronavirus Suspected Cases.,"The world has been facing the COVID-19 pandemic since December 2019. Timely and efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected patients plays a significant role in medical treatment. The deep transfer learning-based automated COVID-19 diagnosis on chest X-ray is required to counter the COVID-19 outbreak. This work proposes a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) framework for early diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients by using ensemble deep transfer learning. The proposed framework offers real-time communication and diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases. The proposed IoT framework ensembles four deep learning models such as InceptionResNetV2, ResNet152V2, VGG16, and DenseNet201. The medical sensors are utilized to obtain the chest X-ray modalities and diagnose the infection by using the deep ensemble model stored on the cloud server. The proposed deep ensemble model is compared with six well-known transfer learning models over the chest X-ray dataset. Comparative analysis revealed that the proposed model can help radiologists to efficiently and timely diagnose the COVID-19 suspected patients."
7518,The Impact of Post-COVID-19 Syndrome on Self-Reported Physical Activity.,"Background: A subgroup of patients recovering from COVID-19 experience persistent symptoms, decreased quality of life, increased dependency on others for personal care and impaired performance of activities of daily living. However, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on physical activity (PA) in this subgroup of patients with persistent symptoms remain unclear. Methods: Demographics, self-reported average time spent walking per week, as well as participation in activities pre-COVID-19 and after three and six months of follow-up were assessed in members of online long-COVID-19 peer support groups. Results: Two hundred thirty-nine patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were included (83% women, median (IQR) age: 50 (39-56) years). Patients reported a significantly decreased weekly walking time after three months of follow-up (three months: 60 (15-120) min. vs. pre-COVID-19: 120 (60-240) min./week; p < 0.05). Six months after the onset of symptoms walking time was still significantly lower compared to pre-COVID-19 but significantly increased compared to three months of follow-up (three months: 60 (15-120) min. vs. six months: 90 (30-150) min.; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Patients who experience persistent symptoms after COVID-19 may still demonstrate a significantly decreased walking time six months after the onset of symptoms. More research is needed to investigate long-term consequences and possible treatment options to guide patients during the recovery fromCOVID-19."
7519,Analytical performance evaluation of five RT-PCR kits for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.,"Background: We aimed to evaluate the analytical performance of five commercial RT-PCR kits (Genekey, Daan, BioGerm, Liferiver, and Yaneng) commonly used in China, since such comparison data are lacking. Methods: A total of 20 COVID-19 confirmed patients and 30 negative nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed by five kits. The detection ability of five RT-PCR kits was evaluated with 5 concentration gradients diluted by a single positive sample. The limit of detection was evaluated by N gene fragment solid standard. Two positive clinical specimens were used to evaluate the repeatability and imprecision. Finally, we used six human coronaviruses plasmid and four respiratory pathogens plasmid to check for cross-reactivity. Results: The positive detection rate was 100% for Genekey, Daan, and BioGerm,and 90% for Liferiver and Yaneng in 20 clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection. The coincidence rate of five kits in 10 negative samples was 100%. The detection rate of target genes for Daan, BioGerm, Liferiver, and Yaneng was 100% from Level 1 to Level 3. In Level 4, only Daan detection rate was 100%. In Level 5, five kits presented poor positive rate. The limit of detection declared by each manufacturer was verified. The repeatability for target genes was less than 5% and so did the total imprecision. There is no cross-reactivity of five kits with six human coronaviruses and four respiratory pathogens for ORF1ab and N gene. Conclusions: Five RT-PCR kits assessed in this study showed acceptable analytical performance characteristics and are useful tools for the routine diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2."
