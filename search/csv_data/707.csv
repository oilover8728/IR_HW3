7061,Impact of Corticosteroids in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outcomes: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Background: Since its appearance in late 2019, infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have created unprecedented challenges for health systems worldwide. Multiple therapeutic options have been explored, including corticosteroids. Preliminary results of corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are encouraging; however, the role of corticosteroids remains controversial. Research question: What is the impact of corticosteroids in mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and viral shedding in COVID-19 patients? Study design and methods: We conducted a systematic review of literature on corticosteroids and COVID-19 in major databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) of published literature through July 22, 2020, that report outcomes of interest in COVID-19 patients receiving corticosteroids with a comparative group. Results: A total of 73 studies with 21,350 COVID-19 patients were identified. Corticosteroid use was reported widely in mechanically ventilated patients (35.3%), ICU patients (51.3%), and severe COVID-19 patients (40%). Corticosteroids showed mortality benefit in severelly ill COVID-19 patients (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.83; P = .0006); however, no beneficial or harmful effects were noted among high-dose or low-dose corticosteroid regimens. Emerging evidence shows that low-dose corticosteroids do not have a significant impact in the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding. The analysis was limited by highly heterogeneous literature for high-dose and low-dose corticosteroids regimens. Interpretation: Our results showed evidence of mortality benefit in severely ill COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are used widely in COVID-19 patients worldwide, and a rapidly developing global pandemic warrants further high-quality clinical trials to define the most beneficial timing and dosing for corticosteroids."
7062,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura and acute liver injury after COVID-19 vaccine.,"A 26-year-old woman was sent to the emergency room by her primary care physician for a new petechial rash and thrombocytopenia 2 weeks after receiving the Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Her hospital course was complicated by transaminitis. Her platelet count improved to normal on hospital day 5 after receiving intravenous steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin to treat her suspected diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Extensive workup for her thrombocytopenia and transaminitis was unremarkable including ruling out infectious, autoimmune and toxic causes. A liver biopsy was unrevealing and her transaminitis was improved on discharge. Although not proven, the temporal relationship of her vaccination with thrombocytopenia and abnormal liver enzymes points towards the Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as the most likely inciting factor."

The implication of vaccines as a trigger for the de novo onset of AD in children or as a cause of exacerbation in individuals with a history of AD has long been debated. We present a brief review of the literature on AD and traditional vaccinations, proposing in addition the main recommendations for the management of patients with AD undergoing the vaccine against the SARS-COV-2 virus. Live attenuated vaccines seem to be associated with a relapse of AD and/or complications, such as eczema vaccinatum. For non-live vaccines, no adverse events are noted in atopic subjects. Since the Covid-19 vaccine is mRNA or viral vectored vaccine and there are no other currently used vaccines of this type, the same recommendations are applied as for all other non-live vaccines."
7065,Review of the Chest CT Differential Diagnosis of Ground-Glass Opacities in the COVID Era.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a recently emerged lower respiratory tract illness, has quickly become a pandemic. The purpose of this review is to discuss and differentiate typical imaging findings of COVID-19 from those of other diseases, which can appear similar in the first instance. The typical CT findings of COVID-19 are bilateral and peripheral predominant ground-glass opacities. As per the Fleischner Society consensus statement, CT is appropriate in certain scenarios, including for patients who are at risk for and/or develop clinical worsening. The probability that CT findings represent COVID-19, however, depends largely on the pretest probability of infection, which is in turn defined by community prevalence of infection. When the community prevalence of COVID-19 is low, a large gap exists between positive predictive values of chest CT versus those of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. This implies that with use of chest CT there are a large number of false-positive results. Imaging differentiation is important for management and isolation purposes and for appropriate disposition of patients with false-positive CT findings. Herein the authors discuss differential pathology with close imaging resemblance to typical CT imaging features of COVID-19 and highlight CT features that may help differentiate COVID-19 from other conditions."

7067,"Of Viruses, Vaccines, and Variability: Qualitative Meaning Matters.","Deaths from COVID-19 depend on millions of people understanding risk and translating this understanding into risk-reduction behaviors. Although numerical information about risk is helpful, numbers are surprisingly ambiguous, and there are predictable mismatches in risk perception between laypeople and experts. Hence, risk communication should convey the qualitative, contextualized meaning of risk."
7068,HLA Does Not Impact on Short-Medium-Term Antibody Response to Preventive Anti-SARS-Cov-2 Vaccine.,"The response to anti-SARS-Cov-2 preventive vaccine shows high interpersonal variability at short and medium term. One of the explanations might be the individual HLA allelic variants. Indeed, B cell response is stimulated and sustained by CD4+ T helper cells activated by antigens presented by HLA-class II alleles on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The impact of the number of antigens binding to HLA class-II alleles on the antibody response to the COVID vaccine has been assessed in a cohort of 56 healthcare workers who received the full schedule of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. Such vaccine is based on the entire spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2. Ab titers have been evaluated 2 weeks after the first dose as well as 2 weeks and 4 months after the boosting dose. HLA-DRB1 and DBQ1 for each of the vaccinees have been assessed, and strong binders have been predicted. The analysis showed no significant correlation between the short-medium-term Ab titers and the number of strong binders (SB) for each individual. These results indicate that levels of Ab response to the spike glycoprotein is not dependent on HLA class II allele, suggesting an equivalent efficacy at global level of the currently used vaccines. Furthermore, the pattern of persistence in Ab titer does not correlate with specific alleles or with the number of SBs."
