7370,Introduction on Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic: The Global Challenge.,"By driving the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), coronaviruses have become a significant change in twenty-first-century medicine, healthcare systems, education, and the global economy. This chapter rapidly reviews the origin, immunopathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and potential therapeutics of COVID-19. It would also explore the effects of the introduction of a single virus, the so-called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on the public health preparedness planning."
7371,Antiviral Activity of the Propylamylatin(TM) Formula against the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro Using Direct Injection and Gas Assays in Virus Suspensions.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a severe threat to global public health. There are currently no antiviral therapies approved for the treatment or prevention of mild to moderate COVID-19 as remdesivir is only approved for severe COVID-19 cases. Here, we evaluated the antiviral potential of a Propylamylatin formula, which is a mixture of propionic acid and isoamyl hexanoates. The Propylamylatin formula was investigated in gaseous and liquid phases against 1 mL viral suspensions containing 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. Viral suspensions were sampled at various times post-exposure and infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Propylamylatin formula vapors were effective at inactivating infectious SARS-CoV-2 to undetectable levels at room temperature and body temperature, but the decline in virus was substantially faster at the higher temperature (15 min versus 24 h). The direct injection of liquid Propylamylatin formula into viral suspensions also completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and the rapidity of inactivation occurred in an exposure dependent manner. The overall volume that resulted in 90% viral inactivation over the course of the direct injection experiment (EC90) was 4.28 µls. Further investigation revealed that the majority of the antiviral effect was attributed to the propionic acid which yielded an overall EC90 value of 11.50 µls whereas the isoamyl hexanoates provided at most a 10-fold reduction in infectious virus. The combination of propionic acid and isoamyl hexanoates was much more potent than the individual components alone, suggesting synergy between these components. These findings illustrate the therapeutic promise of the Propylamylatin formula as a potential treatment strategy for COVID-19 and future studies are warranted."
7372,SARS-CoV-2 Human Challenge Studies - Establishing the Model during an Evolving Pandemic.,
7373,High-Resolution Imaging of Human Viruses in Liquid Droplets.,"Liquid-phase electron microscopy (LP-EM) is an exciting new area in the materials imaging field, providing unprecedented views of molecular processes. Time-resolved insights from LP-EM studies are a strong complement to the remarkable results achievable with other high-resolution techniques. Here, the opportunities to expand LP-EM technology beyond 2D temporal assessments and into the 3D regime are described. The results show new structures and dynamic insights of human viruses contained in minute volumes of liquid while acquired in a rapid timeframe. To develop this strategy, adeno-associated virus (AAV) is used as a model system. AAV is a well-known gene therapy vehicle with current applications involving drug delivery and vaccine development for COVID-19. Improving the understanding of the physical properties of biological entities in a liquid state, as maintained in the human body, has broad societal implications for human health and disease."
7374,Surface interactions and viability of coronaviruses.,"The recently emerged coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has become a worldwide threat affecting millions of people, causing respiratory system related problems that can end up with extremely serious consequences. As the infection rate rises significantly and this is followed by a dramatic increase in mortality, the whole world is struggling to accommodate change and is trying to adapt to new conditions. While a significant amount of effort is focused on developing a vaccine in order to make a game-changing anti-COVID-19 breakthrough, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is also developing mutations rapidly as it transmits just like any other virus and there is always a substantial chance of the invented antibodies becoming ineffective as a function of time, thus failing to inhibit virus-to-cell binding efficiency as the spiked protein keeps evolving. Hence, controlling the transmission of the virus is crucial. Therefore, this review summarizes the viability of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces under different conditions while addressing the current state of known chemical disinfectants for deactivation of the coronaviruses. The review attempts to bring together a wide spectrum of surface-virus-cleaning agent interactions to help identify material selection for inanimate surfaces that have frequent human contact and cleaning procedures for effective prevention of COVID-19 transmission."
7375,Diagnostic accuracy of the FebriDx host response point-of-care test in patients hospitalised with suspected COVID-19.,"Introduction: Management of the COVID-19 pandemic is hampered by long delays associated with centralised laboratory PCR testing. In hospitals this leads to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission and so rapid, accurate diagnostic tests are urgently required. The FebriDx is a point-of-care test that detects an antiviral host response protein in finger prick blood within 10 min, but its accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 is unknown. Methods: We performed a real-world diagnostic accuracy study of FebriDx in hospitalised patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated based on FebriDx results compared to the reference standard of SARS-CoV-2 PCR on combined nose and throat swabs. A multivariable predictive model including FebriDx, age, sex, and clinical characteristics was developed and underwent internal validation. Results: FebriDx was performed on 251 patients and gave a valid result in 248. 118 of 248 (48%) were PCR positive for COVID-19. FebriDx results were available after 10 min compared with 1.7 (1.6 to 2.1) hours with point-of-care PCR testing and 23.4 (17.2 to 31.1) hours with laboratory PCR testing. Sensitivity of FebriDx for the identification of COVID-19 was 93% (110/118; 95% CI 87 to 97%) and specificity was 86% (112/130; 95%CI 79 to 92%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.73 (95%CI 4.37 to 10.37) and 0.08 (95%CI 0.04 to 0.15) respectively. In the multivariate model age, sex and other clinical features did not contribute significantly to the effect of the FebriDx result in distinguishing patients with and without COVID-19. Conclusions: During the first wave of the pandemic, FebriDx had high accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults and could be deployed as a front door triage tool. Trial registration: ISRCTN14966673."
7376,A role for CT in COVID-19? What data really tell us so far.,
7377,Trajectory of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Over Time and Association of Initial Vaccine Hesitancy With Subsequent Vaccination.,This cohort study assesses the association between baseline vaccine hesitancy and vaccine receipt at study follow-up and explores the validity of vaccine self-report.
7378,Warp-Speed Covid-19 Vaccine Development: Beneficiaries of Maturation in Biopharmaceutical Technologies and Public-Private Partnerships.,"It is anticipated that effective vaccines will enable the resumption of social and economic normalcy. Current calls for masking, social distancing and other restrictive measures for the public-good are difficult to enforce and are unstainable. As ~2-4% of the 50 million SARS-CoV2-infected have succumbed to Covid-19, the US department of Health and Human Services has organized a public-private partnership called Operation Warp Speed (OWS) to develop, produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with a January 2021 target. While a majority of the 300+ Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in various stages of preclinical and early-stage clinical testing, 6 clinical candidates are supported with over 10 billion USD plus integrated resources under the OWS agenda. This unprecedented approach is investing in the manufacture of product candidates ahead of product approval. It is enabled by new gene and recombinant pharmaceutical platform technologies that are accelerating the clinical study timeline from ~10 to less than 1 year. It is anticipated that one or more of the 6 candidates under the OWS initiative will be safe, effective and provide a sustained immune response to prevent infection and disease progression. This way, social and economic activities could return to normalcy."
7379,"COVID-19: All Facts, No Myth.","On December 31, 2019, the China Health Authority alerted WHO about 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City. It was subsequently named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease has now become pandemic. Current review was done to summarize information on COVID-19 published in various scientific works. Electronic databases containing medical articles viz., MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar etc were searched using the Medical Subject Headings 'COVID-19', '2019- nCoV', 'coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2' during antecedent one year. All study designs were incorporated to harvest clinical, laboratory, imaging, and hospital course data. The intermediate host of the virus is still unknown. Respiratory droplets produced by the patient is main source of transmission. SARS-CoV-2 invades the airway epithelium by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor with Coronavirus spike (S) protein. Most common symptoms are fever (98%), dry cough (77%), and dyspnea (63.5%). Later, complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock etc may occur. Advanced age and co-morbidities like Diabetes have higher mortality otherwise Case Fatality Rate is 2-3%. RTPCR is the diagnosis of choice. Since no universally accepted registered drug or FDA approved vaccine has come by now, prevention is the key. Hands should be regularly cleaned with soap or alcohol based sanitizer and in public, Nose and Mouth should be covered with face-mask and social distance of one meter should be maintained. While Vaccines are expected by early 2021, we should not forget to take comprehensive measures to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic origin."
