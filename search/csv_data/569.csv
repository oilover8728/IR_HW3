5681,French organization for the pharmacovigilance of COVID-19 vaccines: A major challenge.,"In this special issue, we present the main highlights of the first weeks of pharmacovigilance monitoring of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in this unprecedented situation in France: the deployment of a vaccination during an epidemic period with the aim of vaccinating the entire population and the intense pharmacovigilance and surveillance of these vaccines still under conditional marketing authorizations. In this unprecedented situation, the cross approach and interaction between the French pharmacovigilance network and French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) has been optimized to provide a real-time safety related to COVID-19 vaccines. Every week, pair of regional pharmacovigilance centers gathered safety data from the French pharmacovigilance network, to acutely expertise all the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported with each COVID-19 vaccine within a direct circuit with ANSM. Results of this expertise are presented and discussed with ANSM in order to raise safety signals and take appropriate measures if necessary. These reports are then published online. At the 25th of March 2021, more than 9 815 000 doses were injected and 20,265 ADRs were reported, mostly non-serious (76%). Several potential or confirmed signals were raised at the european level for those vaccines and others ADRs are under special attentions. This underlines the adaptiveness of the French pharmacovigilance system to both the identification of new patient profiles experiencing ADRs and the evolution of the vaccine strategy. Such an efficiency is necessary to manage a careful and acute surveillance of these new COVID-19 vaccines for and to face the pandemic at the same time."
5682,Clinical Evaluation of the Rapid STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test for the Screening of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.,"Standard tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detect the presence of viral RNA using real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR. Recently, convenient, rapid, and relatively inexpensive SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) detection methods have been developed. The STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test (SD Biosensor, Inc., Suwon, Korea) is a rapid immunochromatography test that qualitatively detects the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 using gold conjugated antibodies. We evaluated its performance in comparison with that of Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) in a retrospective case-control study using residual samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test were 89.2% (58/65) and 96.0% (96/100), respectively. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for the three target SARS-CoV-2 genes (envelope, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and nucleocapsid genes) included in Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay were significantly lower in Ag test-positive patients than in Ag test-negative patients (P<0.001). The Ag test sensitivity was higher in samples with Ct≤30 and those collected one to five days post symptom onset. In conclusion, the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test can serve as an alternative in high-prevalence settings, when the low sensitivity is compensated or when rRT-PCR tests are limited."
5683,Nasopharyngeal swab collection in the suspicion of Covid-19.,"RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA on nasopharyngeal swab is the standard for diagnosing active Covid-19 disease in asymptomatic subjects and in symptomatic patients without the typical radiological findings. Nasopharyngeal swabbing appears a trivial procedure, still an inappropriate nasopharyngeal sampling, performed by untrained operators, can be a relevant cause of false negative findings with a clear negative impact on the effort to control the epidemic and, when PPE is not properly used, this can expose healthcare workers and patients to risks of contagion."
5684,Online study of health professionals about their vaccination attitudes and behavior in the COVID-19 era: addressing participation bias.,"Online surveys of health professionals have become increasingly popular during the COVID-19 crisis because of their ease, speed of implementation, and low cost. This article leverages an online survey of general practitioners' (GPs') attitudes toward the soon-to-be-available COVID-19 vaccines, implemented in October-November 2020 (before the COVID-19 vaccines were authorized in France), to study the evolution of the distribution of their demographic and professional characteristics and opinions about these vaccines, as the survey fieldwork progressed, as reminders were sent out to encourage them to participate. Focusing on the analysis of the potential determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, we also tested if factors related to survey participation biased the association estimates. Our results show that online surveys of health professionals may be subject to significant selection bias that can have a significant impact on estimates of the prevalence of some of these professionals' behavioral, opinion, or attitude variables. Our results also highlight the effectiveness of reminder strategies in reaching hard-to-reach professionals and reducing these biases. Finally, they indicate that weighting for nonparticipation remains indispensable and that methods exist for testing (and correcting) selection biases."
5685,Foundation and Clinical Evaluation of a New Method for Detecting SARS-CoV-2 Antigen by Fluorescent Microsphere Immunochromatography.,"Purpose: To develop a rapid detection reagent for SARS-CoV-2 antigen for the auxiliary diagnosis of new coronary pneumonia (COVID-19), and perform the methodological evaluation and clinical evaluation of the reagent. Method: SARS-CoV-2 N-protein test strip was created by combining fluorescent microsphere labeling technology and immunochromatographic technology, based on the principle of double antibody sandwich. Then we evaluated the analytical capability and clinical application of the strips. Result: The limit of detection of the strips for recombinant N protein was 100 ng/ml and for activated SARS -CoV-2 virus was 1 × 103 TCID50/ml. The strips also have high analytical specificity and anti-interference capability. According to the predetermined cut-off value, the specificity of the test strip in healthy controls and patients with other respiratory disease was 100.00 and 97.29%, the sensitivity in COVID-19 cases at progress stage and cured stage was 67.15 and 7.02%. The positive percentage agreement and negative percentage agreement of antigen strip to RNA test were 83.16 and 94.45%. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 fluorescence immunochromatographic test strip can achieve fast, sensitive and accurate detection, which can meet the clinical requirements for rapid detection of viruses on the spot."

5689,The effect of spike mutations on SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.,"Multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines show protective efficacy, which is most likely mediated by neutralizing antibodies recognizing the viral entry protein, spike. Because new SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging rapidly, as exemplified by the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages, it is critical to understand whether antibody responses induced by infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus or current vaccines remain effective. In this study, we evaluate neutralization of a series of mutated spike pseudotypes based on divergence from SARS-CoV and then compare neutralization of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotype and individual mutations. Spike-specific monoclonal antibody neutralization is reduced dramatically; in contrast, polyclonal antibodies from individuals infected in early 2020 remain active against most mutated spike pseudotypes, but potency is reduced in a minority of samples. This work highlights that changes in SARS-CoV-2 spike can alter neutralization sensitivity and underlines the need for effective real-time monitoring of emerging mutations and their effect on vaccine efficacy."
