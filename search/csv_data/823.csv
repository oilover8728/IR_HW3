8221,Insights into the biased activity of dextromethorphan and haloperidol towards SARS-CoV-2 NSP6: in silico binding mechanistic analysis.,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus continually led to infect a large population worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its NSP6 and Orf9c proteins to interact with sigma receptors that are implicated in lipid remodeling and ER stress response, to infect cells. The drugs targeting the sigma receptors, sigma-1 and sigma-2, have emerged as effective candidates to reduce viral infectivity, and some of them are in clinical trials against COVID-19. The antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, exerts remarkable antiviral activity, but, at the same time, the sigma-1 benzomorphan agonist, dextromethorphan, showed pro-viral activity. To explore the potential mechanisms of biased binding and activity of the two drugs, haloperidol and dextromethorphan towards NSP6, we herein utilized molecular docking-based molecular dynamics simulation studies. Our extensive analysis of the protein-drug interactions, structural and conformational dynamics, residual frustrations, and molecular switches of NSP6-drug complexes indicates that dextromethorphan binding leads to structural destabilization and increase in conformational dynamics and energetic frustrations. On the other hand, the strong binding of haloperidol leads to minimal structural and dynamical perturbations to NSP6. Thus, the structural insights of stronger binding affinity and favorable molecular interactions of haloperidol towards viral NSP6 suggests that haloperidol can be potentially explored as a candidate drug against COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: •Inhibitors of sigma receptors are considered as potent drugs against COVID-19. •Antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, binds strongly to NSP6 and induces the minimal changes in structure and dynamics of NSP6. •Dextromethorphan, agonist of sigma receptors, binding leads to overall destabilization of NSP6. •These two drugs bind with NSP6 differently and also induce differences in the structural and conformational changes that explain their different mechanisms of action. •Haloperidol can be explored as a candidate drug against COVID-19."

8223,Haemophilus influenzae and SARS-CoV-2: Is there a role for investigation?,"During the current pandemic of COVID-19, the authors observed that during screening test for SARS-CoV-2 targeting the E-gene by qRT-PCR, few nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples showed amplification signals at late cycle threshold (CT-value) > 35 despite being negative for other confirmatory target genes. Thirty such samples (taken as cases) showing detectable CT of > 35 cycle in E-gene which were negative for other target genes of SARS-CoV-2 and 30 samples with undetectable fluorescence in E-gene were taken as controls for investigation. An in-vitro diagnostic approved commercial qRT-PCR multiplex kit detecting 33 respiratory pathogens which can also detect Haemophilus influenzae was used for screening the samples. It was observed that out of the 30 samples showing detectable CT> 35 in E-gene, 11 samples were positive for Haemophilus influenzae whereas in the controls only three samples were positive for H. influenzae (p-value: 0.03) which was statistically significant. Further, the probes and primers were screened against H. influenzae for matches in the genome. It was observed that all primers and probes for the E-gene of SARS-CoV-2 had over 13 bp long sequences matching 100% with multiple sites across the H. influenzae genome. This qRT-PCR primer & probes are being used extensively across India, and laboratories using them should be aware of the cross-reactivity of primers & probes with the H. influenzae genome. Further, the authors observed that 95.9% (5415/5642) of COVID-19 positive cases detected in their laboratory were asymptomatic at the time of collection of samples. This warrants further investigations."
8224,"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a report from a sub-Saharan African country, Senegal.","Introduction: To investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy in Senegal. Methods: This was a cross-sectional and descriptive study of all cases of COVID-19 including nine pregnant women who were admitted in COVID-19 treatment centers in Senegal from March 2 to May 15, 2020. SARS-COV-2 infection was confirmed by PCR. Patients' characteristics, clinical features, treatment and outcome were obtained with a customized data collection form. Results: The frequency of the association COVID-19 and pregnancy was 0.5%. The age range of the patients was 18-42 years with an average 28 years, and the range of gestational weeks at admission was 7 weeks to 32 weeks. None of the patients had underlying diseases. All the patients presented with a headache and only four of them had fever. Other symptoms were also observed: two patients had a cough, two had rhinorrhea, and two patients reported poor appetite. The median time to recovery was 13.6 days, corresponding to the number of days in hospital. None of the nine pregnant women developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. Conclusion: Pregnant women appear to have the same contamination predispositions and clinical features of SARS-COV-2 infection as the general population. This study shows no evidence that pregnant women are more susceptible to infection with coronavirus."
8225,Imaging and clinical features of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also called 2019-nCoV) recently break out in Wuhan, China, and was named as COVID-19. With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. Methods: All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). This analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18-86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics, pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In addition, after 1-6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were evaluated to assess radiological evolution. Findings: The majority of infected patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%), adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55 (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3-4 days. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia."
8226,Novel insights into the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection: An overview of current clinical trials.,"The emergence of the global pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has motivated scientists to find a definitive treatment or a vaccine against it in the shortest possible time. Current efforts towards this goal remain fruitless without a full understanding of the behavior of the virus and its adaptor proteins. This review provides an overview of the biological properties, functional mechanisms, and molecular components of SARS-CoV-2, along with investigational therapeutic and preventive approaches for this virus. Since the proteolytic cleavage of the S protein is critical for virus penetration into cells, a set of drugs, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, camostat mesylate have been tested in clinical trials to suppress this event. In addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the role of CD147 in the viral entrance has also been proposed. Mepolizumab has shown to be effective in blocking the virus's cellular entrance. Antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, darunavir, lopinavir, zanamivir, peramivir, and oseltamivir, have also been tested as treatments for COVID-19. Regarding preventive vaccines, the whole virus, vectors, nucleic acids, and structural subunits have been suggested for vaccine development. Mesenchymal stem cells and natural killer cells could also be used against SARS-CoV-2. All the above-mentioned strategies, as well as the role of nanomedicine for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, have been discussed in this review."

8228,Infection Mechanism of SARS-COV-2 and Its Implication on the Nervous System.,"In late December 2019, multiple atypical pneumonia cases resulted in severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a pathogen identified as a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The most common coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms are pneumonia, fever, dry cough, and fatigue. However, some neurological complications following SARS-CoV-2 infection include confusion, cerebrovascular diseases, ataxia, hypogeusia, hyposmia, neuralgia, and seizures. Indeed, a growing literature demonstrates that neurotropism is a common feature of coronaviruses; therefore, the infection mechanisms already described in other coronaviruses may also be applicable for SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms in the nervous system infection and the neurological involvement is essential to assess possible long-term neurological alteration of COVID-19. Here, we provide an overview of associated literature regarding possible routes of COVID-19 neuroinvasion, such as the trans-synapse-connected route in the olfactory pathway and peripheral nerve terminals and its neurological implications in the central nervous system."
8229,Genetic Variation and Evolution of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of coronavirus causing a pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-2). Coronaviruses are very diverting genetically and mutate so often periodically. The natural selection of viral mutations may cause host infection selectivity and infectivity. Methods: This study was aimed to indicate the diversity between human and animal coronaviruses through finding the rate of mutation in each of the spike, nucleocapsid, envelope, and membrane proteins. Results: The mutation rate is abundant in all 4 structural proteins. The most number of statistically significant amino acid mutations were found in spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) which may be because it is responsible for a corresponding receptor binding in a broad range of hosts and host selectivity to infect. Among 17 previously known amino acids which are important for binding of spike to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, all of them are conservative among human coronaviruses, but only 3 of them significantly are mutated in animal coronaviruses. A single amino acid aspartate-454, that causes dissociation of the RBD of the spike and ACE2, and F486 which gives the strength of binding with ACE2 remain intact in all coronaviruses. Discussion/conclusion: Observations of this study provided evidence of the genetic diversity and rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other human and animal coronaviruses."
