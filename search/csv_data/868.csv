8670,[Thoughts and suggestions on analysis of death cases report during COVID-19 epidemic].,"It is an essential task to discuss the death cases for clinicians. During the emergent public events, the report and analysis of death cases is of far-reaching significance. The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has brought huge losses to China, and the medical system has been sustaining tremendous pressure. The best weapon to defeat the epidemic is medical data and related scientific research, of which the systematic analysis and efficient use of death cases is a key step. Based on the incomplete record of death case report, the lack of humanistic perspective and patient report, every department and institution is facing great challenge in terms of data management. Given that the relevant systems need to be improved, and that the integration of standardized reports and clinical research is not mature,as well as other problems, we put forward several methodological suggestions: ① Establish national medical and health data center and improve relevant laws and regulations. ② Increase investment in medical data management and start data collection and analysis as early as possible during the epidemic. ③ Refine the content of death case report and promote the standardization of report. ④ Pay close attention to the report of death cases, review, summary and analysis. More importantly, we should continue to build and improve platforms and programs related to disease control, carry out epidemic-associated scientific research, enhance the managing efficiency of public health data, elevate the anti-risk capability of our medical system, and promote the steady progress of the health China strategy."
8671,[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery and organ transplantation].,"Background and objective: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic extensive reorganization and limitation of resources within the healthcare system became inevitable. This review highlights the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fields of hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgery and organ transplantation incorporating the current literature and expert opinions published by national and international societies. Trends in surgical numbers were analyzed via the Eurotransplant Statistics Report Library and an in-center evaluation of HPB surgical procedures. Results: For the fields of HPB surgery and organ transplantation a drastic decrease of procedures performed during the first wave of the pandemic was broadly reported. Interestingly, a compensatory increase of procedures was mostly not observed during the following months resulting in a slight overall decrease for 2020 compared to 2019. Whether this trend was due to increased mortality because of postponed surgeries and altered treatment regimens cannot be ruled out at this time. A severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is definitely associated with a complicated course, especially in the perioperative course and after transplantation. Discussion: Due to the increased risk profile of the named patient groups, there is an increased risk for a severe COVID-19 course. This must be considered when weighing up the treatment alternatives, protection recommendations and prioritization for vaccinations."
8672,Heparin: A simplistic repurposing to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in light of its in-vitro nanomolar efficacy.,"The world is currently facing a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The greatest threat that is disrupting the normal functioning of society is the exceptionally high species independent transmission. Drug repurposing is understood to be the best strategy to immediately deploy well-characterized agents against new pathogens. Several repurposable drugs are already in evaluation for determining suitability to treat COVID-19. One such promising compound includes heparin, which is widely used in reducing thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 induced pathology. As part of identifying target-specific antiviral compounds among FDA and world-approved libraries using high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), we previously evaluated top hits for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Here, we report results of highly efficacious viral entry blocking properties of heparin (IC50 = 12.3 nM) in the complete virus assay, and further, propose ways to use it as a potential transmission blocker. Exploring further, our in-silico analysis indicated that the heparin interacts with post-translational glycoconjugates present on spike proteins. The patterns of accessible spike-glycoconjugates in open and closed states are completely contrasted by one another. Heparin-binding to the open conformation of spike structurally supports the state and may aid ACE2 binding as reported with cell surface-bound heparan sulfate. We also studied spike protein mutant variants' heparin interactions for possible resistance. Based on available data and optimal absorption properties by the skin, heparin could potentially be used to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Studies should be designed to exploit its nanomolar antiviral activity to formulate heparin as topical or inhalation-based formulations, particularly on exposed areas and sites of primary viremia e.g. ACE2 rich epithelia of the eye (conjunctiva/lids), nasal cavity, and mouth."
8673,Liver-spleen axis dysfunction in COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly through the respiratory route. Besides interstitial pneumonia, a number of other clinical manifestations were noticed in COVID-19 patients. In particular, liver and spleen dysfunctions have been described both as complications of COVID-19 and as potential predisposing factors for severe COVID-19. Liver damage is rather common in COVID-19 patients, and it is most likely multifactorial, caused by the direct insult of SARS-CoV-2 to the liver by the cytokine storm triggered by the virus, by the use of hepatotoxic drugs, and as a consequence of hypoxia. Although generally mild, liver impairment has been found to be associated with a higher rate of intensive care unit admission. A higher mortality rate was reported among chronic liver disease patients. Instead, spleen impairment in patients with COVID-19 has been poorly described. The main anatomical changes are the architectural derangement of the B cell compartment, white pulp atrophy, and reduction or absence of lymphoid follicles, while, from a functional point of view, the IgM memory B cell pool is markedly depleted. The outcome of COVID-19 in asplenic or hyposplenic patients is yet to be defined. In this review, we will summarise the current knowledge regarding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver and spleen function, as well as the outcome of patients with a pre-existent liver disease or defective spleen function."

8675,Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the serum prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with biologic drugs.,"Background: Patients receiving biologic therapies are at risk for viral infections. This study investigated the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the serum prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with biologic drugs. Methods: Information on demography, co-morbidities, clinical data regarding IBD, symptoms suggestive of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, close contacts with SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, hospitalization, and therapies administered for COVID-19 was collected for all patients who were being treated with biologic drugs. All patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Results: Two hundred and fifty-nine patients (27 children) with a mean age of 42.2 ± 16.7 years (range 9 - 88) and a mean duration of disease of 13.4 ± 10 years (range 0.2 - 49) were enrolled. One hundred four patients (40.2%) had ulcerative colitis, and 155 (59.8%) had Crohn's disease. About the therapy: 62 patients were receiving infliximab, 89 adalimumab, 20 golimumab, 57 vedolizumab, 27 ustekinumab, 1 thalidomide, and 3 an experimental compound. The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2. Thirty-two patients (12.3%) reported respiratory symptoms, and 2 of them were hospitalized (0.77%). Two patients resulted positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (0.77%). Conclusions: In patients with IBD, treatment with biologic drug does not represent a risk factor for the SARS-CoV-2 infection."
8676,Serial co-expression analysis of host factors from SARS-CoV viruses highly converges with former high-throughput screenings and proposes key regulators.,"The current genomics era is bringing an unprecedented growth in the amount of gene expression data, only comparable to the exponential growth of sequences in databases during the last decades. This data allow the design of secondary analyses that take advantage of this information to create new knowledge. One of these feasible analyses is the evaluation of the expression level for a gene through a series of different conditions or cell types. Based on this idea, we have developed Automatic and Serial Analysis of CO-expression, which performs expression profiles for a given gene along hundreds of heterogeneous and normalized transcriptomics experiments and discover other genes that show either a similar or an inverse behavior. It might help to discover co-regulated genes, and common transcriptional regulators in any biological model. The present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is an opportunity to test this novel approach due to the wealth of data that are being generated, which could be used for validating results. Thus, we have identified 35 host factors in the literature putatively involved in the infectious cycle of SARS-CoV viruses and searched for genes tightly co-expressed with them. We have found 1899 co-expressed genes whose assigned functions are strongly related to viral cycles. Moreover, this set of genes heavily overlaps with those identified by former laboratory high-throughput screenings (with P-value near 0). Our results reveal a series of common regulators, involved in immune and inflammatory responses that might be key virus targets to induce the coordinated expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors."
8677,A combined oropharyngeal/nares swab is a suitable alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"Given the global shortage of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs typically used for respiratory virus detection, alternative collection methods were evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study showed that a combined oropharyngeal/nares swab is a suitable alternative to NP swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, with sensitivities of 91.7% and 94.4%, respectively."
8678,Persistence and baseline determinants of seropositivity and reinfection rates in health care workers up to 12.5 months after COVID-19.,"We assessed the duration and baseline determinants of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens and the occurrence of reinfections in a prospective cohort of 173 Spanish primary health care worker patients followed initially for 9 months and subsequently up to 12.5 months after COVID-19 symptoms onset. Seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor-binding domain antigens up to 149-270 days was 92.49% (90.17% IgG, 76.3% IgA, 60.69% IgM). In a subset of 64 health care workers who had not yet been vaccinated by April 2021, seropositivity was 96.88% (95.31% IgG, 82.81% IgA) up to 322-379 days post symptoms onset. Four suspected reinfections were detected by passive case detection, two among seronegative individuals (5 and 7 months after the first episode), and one low antibody responder. Antibody levels significantly correlated with fever, hospitalization, anosmia/hypogeusia, allergies, smoking, and occupation. Stable sustainment of IgG responses raises hope for long-lasting COVID-19 vaccine immunity."
8679,(18)F-FDG PET/CT findings of COVID-19: a series of four highly suspected cases.,"Purpose: The aim of this case series is to illustrate the 18F-FDG PET/CT findings of patients with acute respiratory disease caused by COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. Methods: We describe the 18F-FDG PET/CT results from four patients who were admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever between January 13 and January 20, 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was still unrecognized and the virus infectivity was unknown. A retrospective review of the patients' medical history, clinical and laboratory data, as well as imaging findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of COVID-19. Results: All patients had peripheral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in more than two pulmonary lobes. Lung lesions were characterized by a high 18F-FDG uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Conversely, disseminated disease was absent, a finding suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism. Conclusions: Although 18F-FDG PET/CT cannot be routinely used in an emergency setting and is generally not recommended for infectious diseases, our pilot data shed light on the potential clinical utility of this imaging technique in the differential diagnosis of complex cases."
