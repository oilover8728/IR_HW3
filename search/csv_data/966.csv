9650,The Proportion of SARS-CoV-2 Infections That Are Asymptomatic : A Systematic Review.,"Background: Asymptomatic infection seems to be a notable feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the prevalence is uncertain. Purpose: To estimate the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who never develop symptoms. Data sources: Searches of Google News, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and PubMed using the keywords antibodies, asymptomatic, coronavirus, COVID-19, PCR, seroprevalence, and SARS-CoV-2. Study selection: Observational, descriptive studies and reports of mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 that were either cross-sectional or longitudinal in design; were published through 17 November 2020; and involved SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antibody testing of a target population, regardless of current symptomatic status, over a defined period. Data extraction: The authors collaboratively extracted data on the study design, type of testing performed, number of participants, criteria for determining symptomatic status, testing results, and setting. Data synthesis: Sixty-one eligible studies and reports were identified, of which 43 used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs to detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18 used antibody testing to detect current or prior infection. In the 14 studies with longitudinal data that reported information on the evolution of symptomatic status, nearly three quarters of persons who tested positive but had no symptoms at the time of testing remained asymptomatic. The highest-quality evidence comes from nationwide, representative serosurveys of England (n = 365 104) and Spain (n = 61 075), which suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. Limitation: For PCR-based studies, data are limited to distinguish presymptomatic from asymptomatic infection. Heterogeneity precluded formal quantitative syntheses. Conclusion: Available data suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. Longitudinal studies suggest that nearly three quarters of persons who receive a positive PCR test result but have no symptoms at the time of testing will remain asymptomatic. Control strategies for COVID-19 should be altered, taking into account the prevalence and transmission risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary funding source: National Institutes of Health."
9651,[COVID-19 with respect to occupational healthcare and public health services].,"Background: Healthcare personnel (HCP) have an occupation-related risk of an infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can transmit COVID-19 to patients. The related occupational disease is the BK 3101. Objective: The frequency of suspected claims of occupation-related SARS-CoV‑2 infections and confirmed claims of COVID-19 occupational diseases, reporting obligations under the German Infection Protection Act (IfSG) and mandatory notification requirements of physicians. Material and methods: Selective literature search with special respect to data of accident insurance institutions regarding occupation-related SARS-CoV‑2 infections among HCP. Results: The SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic also represents a challenge for occupational healthcare and the public health service. In recent months an increased number of suspected cases of an occupational disease (BK 3101) associated with COVID-19 were registered at the accident insurance institutions as well as notifications of accidents at work. The public health service handles registrations under the IfSG and coordinates the tracking of contact persons. Conclusion: Occupation-related SARS-CoV‑2 infections are a real reason for concern. The registration data of the accident insurance institutions confirm high case numbers. Preventive measures, such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 vaccinations significantly reduce the risk of infection among HCP as well as the risk of nosocomial transmission to patients."
9652,"Stenoparib, an Inhibitor of Cellular Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase, Blocks Replication of the SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 Human Coronaviruses In Vitro.","By late 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had caused tens of millions of infections and over 1 million deaths worldwide. A protective vaccine and more effective therapeutics are urgently needed. We evaluated a new poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, stenoparib, that recently advanced to phase II clinical trials for treatment of ovarian cancer, for activity against human respiratory coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in vitro Stenoparib exhibits dose-dependent suppression of SARS-CoV-2 multiplication and spread in Vero E6 monkey kidney and Calu-3 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Stenoparib was also strongly inhibitory to the human seasonal respiratory coronavirus HCoV-NL63. Compared to remdesivir, which inhibits viral replication downstream of cell entry, stenoparib impedes entry and postentry processes, as determined by time-of-addition (TOA) experiments. Moreover, a 10 μM dosage of stenoparib-below the approximated 25.5 μM half-maximally effective concentration (EC50)-combined with 0.5 μM remdesivir suppressed coronavirus growth by more than 90%, indicating a potentially synergistic effect for this drug combination. Stenoparib as a stand-alone or as part of combinatorial therapy with remdesivir should be a valuable addition to the arsenal against COVID-19.IMPORTANCE New therapeutics are urgently needed in the fight against COVID-19. Repurposing drugs that are either already approved for human use or are in advanced stages of the approval process can facilitate more rapid advances toward this goal. The PARP inhibitor stenoparib may be such a drug, as it is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer and its safety and dosage in humans have already been established. Our results indicate that stenoparib possesses strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in vitro. This activity appears to be based on multiple modes of action, where both pre-entry and postentry viral replication processes are impeded. This may provide a therapeutic advantage over many current options that have a narrower target range. Moreover, our results suggest that stenoparib and remdesivir in combination may be especially potent against coronavirus infection."
9653,Moroccan Medicinal plants as inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease: Computational investigations.,"The new Corona-virus, recently called the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) appears for the first time in China and more precisely in Wuhan (December 2019). This disease can be fatal. Seniors, and people with other medical conditions (diabetes, heart disease…), may be more vulnerable and become seriously ill. This is why research into drugs to treat this infection remains essential in several research laboratories. Natural herbal remedies have long been the main, if not the only, remedy in the oral tradition for treating illnesses. Modern medicine has known its success thanks to traditional medicine, the effectiveness of which derives from medicinal plants. The objective of this study is to determine if the components of natural origin have an anti-viral effect and which can prevent humans from infection by this coronavirus using the most reliable method is molecular docking, which used to find the interaction between studied molecules and the protein, in our case we based on the inhibitor of Coronavirus (nCoV-2019) main protease. The results of molecular docking showed that among 67 molecules of natural origin, three molecules (Crocin, Digitoxigenin, and β-Eudesmol) are proposed as inhibitors against the coronavirus based on the energy types of interaction between these molecules and studied protein. [Formula: see text] Communicated by Ramaswamy H. SarmaHighlightsDetermine natural compounds that can have an anti-viral effect and which can prevent humans from infection by this coronavirus;Molecular docking to find interaction between the molecules studied and the receptor of COVID-19;The synthesis of these molecules and the evaluation of their in vitro activity against SARS-Cov-2 could be interesting."
9654,Application of Viral Vectors for Vaccine Development with a Special Emphasis on COVID-19.,"Viral vectors can generate high levels of recombinant protein expression providing the basis for modern vaccine development. A large number of different viral vector expression systems have been utilized for targeting viral surface proteins and tumor-associated antigens. Immunization studies in preclinical animal models have evaluated the elicited humoral and cellular responses and the possible protection against challenges with lethal doses of infectious pathogens or tumor cells. Several vaccine candidates for both infectious diseases and various cancers have been subjected to a number of clinical trials. Human immunization trials have confirmed safe application of viral vectors, generation of neutralizing antibodies and protection against challenges with lethal doses. A special emphasis is placed on COVID-19 vaccines based on viral vectors. Likewise, the flexibility and advantages of applying viral particles, RNA replicons and DNA replicon vectors of self-replicating RNA viruses for vaccine development are presented."
9655,COVID-19 - Important considerations for developing and using a vaccine.,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 after emerging in China has caused a global pandemic that is risking the lives of millions. COVID-19 has spread across the world at a very rapid rate raising concerns of capacity limitations and lack of unified responses at the global level, particularly from the world's most developed countries. The spread of further infection has been curtailed by lockdown and mass social distancing that has been enforced in most parts of the world. There are no clinical data yet suggesting that any available candidate vaccine will be effective for COVID-19 which will be a critical need for eventually preventing this disease. Extensive research is underway with some success in identification of monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 recovered patients, which may inform on vaccine development. The clinical evaluations of COVID-19 vaccines need to follow standardized protocols that are essential for safeguarding humans. In absence of a vaccine or a widely available effective therapy, quarantine and other preventive measures are essential in curtailing the risk of pandemic spread."
9656,Can We Test Our Way Out of the COVID-19 Pandemic?,"Frequent, low-cost, universal testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with quarantine of those with a positive result has been suggested as a strategy to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. Specifically, home or community use of tests that use paper strip detection devices, which may have reduced sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2, has been advocated. There are several potential challenges or problems with this strategy, including the limited availability of such tests, consequences of incorrect test results, difficulties with adherence to testing, and the questionable accuracy of such tests for detection of infectious people. Because of these, we think it is premature to strongly advocate for such a testing strategy, as the adverse consequences may outweigh any benefits. High-quality outcome data demonstrating the efficacy of this testing strategy are needed before widespread implementation."
9657,Extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 detection by rapid RT-qPCR universal for all primary respiratory materials.,"Background: Fast and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for efficient control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing there is a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction reagents. Therefore, extraction-free RT-qPCR protocols are urgently needed. Objectives: To establish a rapid RT-qPCR protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need of RNA extraction suitable for all respiratory materials. Material and methods: Different SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory materials from our routine laboratory were used as crude material after heat inactivation in direct RT-qPCR with the PrimeDirect™ Probe RT-qPCR Mix (TaKaRa). SARS-CoV-2 was detected using novel primers targeted to the E-gene. Results: The protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in crude material used a prepared frozen-PCR mix with optimized primers and 5 μl of fresh, undiluted and pre-analytically heat inactivated respiratory material. For validation, 91 respiratory samples were analyzed in direct comparison to classical RNA-based RT-qPCR. Overall 81.3 % of the samples were detected in both assays with a strong correlation between both Ct values (r = 0.8492, p < 0.0001). The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate by direct RT-qPCR was 95.8 % for Ct values <35. All negative samples were characterized by low viral loads (Ct >35) and/or long storage times before sample processing. Conclusion: Direct RT-qPCR is a suitable alternative to classical RNA RT-qPCR, provided that only fresh samples (storage <1 week) are used. RNA extraction should be considered if samples have longer storage times or if PCR inhibition is observed. In summary, this protocol is fast, inexpensive and suitable for all respiratory materials."

9659,In Silico Screening of Natural Products Isolated from Mexican Herbal Medicines against COVID-19.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken the lives of more than 2 million people worldwide, causing several political and socio-economic disturbances in our daily life. At the time of publication, there are non-effective pharmacological treatments, and vaccine distribution represents an important challenge for all countries. In this sense, research for novel molecules becomes essential to develop treatments against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this context, Mexican natural products have proven to be quite useful for drug development; therefore, in the present study, we perform an in silico screening of 100 compounds isolated from the most commonly used Mexican plants, against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As results, we identify ten compounds that meet leadlikeness criteria (emodin anthrone, kaempferol, quercetin, aesculin, cichoriin, luteolin, matricin, riolozatrione, monocaffeoyl tartaric acid, aucubin). According to the docking analysis, only three compounds target the key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (quercetin, riolozatrione and cichoriin), but only one appears to be safe (cichoriin). ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) properties and the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model show that cichoriin reaches higher lung levels (100 mg/Kg, IV); therefore, it may be considered in developing therapeutic tools."
