9930,What's Old is New! Similarities Between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV.,
9931,The Emergence of Human Pathogenic Coronaviruses: Lectins as Antivirals for SARS-CoV-2.,"Background: Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are common viruses and known to be associated with respiratory diseases, including pneumonia. Currently, seven human coronaviruses have been identified and known to cause upper and lower respiratory infections as well as nosocomial viral infections in humans. The bats, palm civets, and camels are identified as the reservoir of human coronaviruses. In 2002-2003, the emergence of SARS-CoV resulted in an outbreak and led towards the more awareness and importance of scientific research and medical urgency. Methods: The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 was identified from the seafood market of the city Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and caused a global pandemic. This virus has now spread to more than 213 countries. This is the third highly pathogenic human coronavirus after SARS and MERS-CoV. The coronaviruses have RNA as genetic material and are known to have frequent recombination and mutations in their genome, which lead to the emergence and re-emergence of new virus strains and isolates with novel properties and extended hosts. The genetic mutations and suitable environmental conditions result in the emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic coronaviruses and cause a serious issue to human health and the economy globally. Lectins are the ubiquitous group of proteins that bind to glycosylated molecules. Conclusion: The plant lectins are known to have significant antiviral activities against coronaviruses. Additionally, the plant lectins can be used as potential therapeutics against bacteria, fungus, yeast, and protozoa. In this review, we have discussed the current status of human pathogenic coronavirus emergence and the use of plant lectins as antivirals against SARS-CoV-2."
9932,Population-based seroprevalence surveys of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody: An up-to-date review.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a global pandemic. However, the majority of currently available data are restricted to laboratory-confirmed cases for symptomatic patients, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection can manifest as an asymptomatic or mild disease. Therefore, the true extent of the burden of COVID-19 may be underestimated. Improved serological detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could help estimate the true numbers of infections. This article comprehensively reviews the associated literature and provides updated information regarding the seroprevalence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The seroprevalence can vary across different sites and the seroprevalence can increase with time during longitudinal follow-up. Although healthcare workers (HCWs), especially those caring for COVID-19 patients, are considered as a high-risk group, the seroprevalence in HCWs wearing adequate personal protective equipment is thought to be no higher than that in other groups. With regard to sex, no statistically significant difference has been found between male and female subjects. Some, but not all, studies have shown that children have a lower risk than other age groups. Finally, seroprevalence can vary according to different populations, such as pregnant women and hemodialysis patients; however, limited studies have examined these associations. Furthermore, the continued surveillance of seroprevalence is warranted to estimate and monitor the growing burden of COVID-19."
9933,Post-COVID-19 Syndrome and the Potential Benefits of Exercise.,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is leading to unknown and unusual health conditions that are challenging to manage. Post-COVID-19 syndrome is one of those challenges, having become increasingly common as the pandemic evolves. The latest estimates suggest that 10 to 20% of the SARS-CoV-2 patients who undergo an acute symptomatic phase are experiencing effects of the disease beyond 12 weeks after diagnosis. Although research is beginning to examine this new condition, there are still serious concerns about the diagnostic identification, which limits the best therapeutic approach. Exercise programs and physical activity levels are well-known modulators of the clinical manifestations and prognosis in many chronic diseases. This narrative review summarizes the up-to-date evidence on post-COVID-19 syndrome to contribute to a better knowledge of the disease and explains how regular exercise may improve many of these symptoms and could reduce the long-term effects of COVID-19."
9934,[Ophthalmological care of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in intensive care units].,"Early ophthalmological care of patients in intensive care with SARS-CoV‑2 (Severe-Acute-Respiratory-Syndrom-Corona-Virus-2) infections is very time-consuming; however, this approach might prevent other ophthalmological diseases, such as lagophthalmos. There is no difference in ophthalmological treatment between SARS-CoV‑2 positive and other intensive care patients. Due to the small number of cases in our observational study, a specific ophthalmological clinical pattern related to SARS-CoV‑2 infections cannot currently be identified; however, the increased occurrence of subconjunctival hemorrhage in intensive care SARS-CoV‑2 patients is remarkable. It remains unclear how ocular symptoms in SARS-CoV‑2 infections are related or how they occur in different stages of the disease. Therefore, further studies are necessary for representative statements."
9935,A straightforward molecular strategy to retrospectively investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 VOC202012/01 B.1.1.7 variant.,"The spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants represents a serious threat worldwide, thus rapid and cost-effective methods are required for their identification. Since November 2020, the TaqPath COVID-19 assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) has been used to identify viral strains of the new lineage B.1.1.7, since it fails to detect the S-gene with the ∆69/70 deletion. Here, we proposed S-gene mutations screening with the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 assay (Seegene), another widely used RT-PCR test that targets Sarbecovirus E, SARS-CoV-2 N, and RdRp/S genes. Accordingly, we evaluated the S gene amplification curve pattern compared to those of the other genes. Exploiting an Allplex assay-generated dataset, we screened 663 RT-PCR digital records, including all SARS-CoV-2 respiratory samples tested in our laboratory with the Allplex assay between January 1st and February 25th, 2021. This approach enabled us to detect 64 samples with peculiar non-sigmoidal amplification curves. Sequencing a selected group of 4 RNA viral genomes demonstrated that those curves were associated with B.1.1.7 variant strains. Our results strongly suggest that B.1.1.7 variant spread has begun in this area at least since January and imply the potential of these analytical methods to track and characterize the spread of B.1.1.7 strains in those areas where Allplex SARS-CoV-2 datasets have been previously recorded."
9936,Identifying and repurposing antiviral drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with in silico and in vitro approaches.,"Coronavirus infectious diseases 2019 (COVID-19), a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a serious public health threat worldwide. So far, there are no drugs and vaccines whose efficacy has been well-proven. After the outbreak, there has been a massive search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 medications, focusing on approved drugs because repurposing approved drugs will take less time to reach clinical usage than new drugs. This article summarizes the studies using in silico and in vitro approaches to identify therapeutic candidates among approved drugs that target the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle."
9937,Short-term inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by hydrogen peroxide in persistent nasopharyngeal carriers.,"Asymptomatic and convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) subjects may carry severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for months in their upper respiratory ways. Desiring to permanently clean the mucosal surfaces, we investigated the chemical agents that fit to rapidly degrade the virus. Among these, hydrogen peroxide, initially tested by two of us for tolerability, showed both good performance and acceptable side effects (burning sensation for 15-20 s). We contacted circles of family physicians and the ATS Milano (Territorial Assistance and Prevention Service), and we tested this procedure on eight persistent carriers of SARS-CoV-2, performing swabs before the procedure and after it until the reappearance of the virus or until 14 days (the incubation period), keeping the surfaces clean with a hypertonic solution. Our patients had a median time from exposure or symptom onset of 111 days, and three had relapsed after being declared ""cured"" (two consecutive negative swabs after quarantine). One patient had a baseline negative swab and was excluded, and two successfully ended the 14 days' course, four suppressed viral elimination for 72 h, and one for 48 h, all rebounding to weak positive (cycle thresholds above 24). Although temporarily effective, such measures may have some place in the control of viral shedding to protect the most fragile subjects."
9938,Outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States.,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, a global pandemic. In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in [Formula: see text] provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56 ± 0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47 ± 0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82 ± 2.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific, whereas the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in [Formula: see text] states, we adopted the disease-specific values from China and found a contact period of 3.38 ± 0.69 days. Our network model predicts that-without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today-the United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 ± 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lockdown, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole."
9939,Estimating COVID-19 prevalence and infection control practices among US dentists.,"Background: Understanding the risks associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission during oral health care delivery and assessing mitigation strategies for dental offices are critical to improving patient safety and access to oral health care. Methods: The authors invited licensed US dentists practicing primarily in private practice or public health to participate in a web-based survey in June 2020. Dentists from every US state (n = 2,195) answered questions about COVID-19-associated symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection, mental and physical health conditions, and infection control procedures used in their primary dental practices. Results: Most of the dentists (82.2%) were asymptomatic for 1 month before administration of the survey; 16.6% reported being tested for SARS-CoV-2; and 3.7%, 2.7%, and 0% tested positive via respiratory, blood, and salivary samples, respectively. Among those not tested, 0.3% received a probable COVID-19 diagnosis from a physician. In all, 20 of the 2,195 respondents had been infected with SARS-CoV-2; weighted according to age and location to approximate all US dentists, 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.5) had confirmed or probable COVID-19. Dentists reported symptoms of depression (8.6%) and anxiety (19.5%). Enhanced infection control procedures were implemented in 99.7% of dentists' primary practices, most commonly disinfection, COVID-19 screening, social distancing, and wearing face masks. Most practicing dentists (72.8%) used personal protective equipment according to interim guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Conclusions: COVID-19 prevalence and testing positivity rates were low among practicing US dentists. This indicates that the current infection control recommendations may be sufficient to prevent infection in dental settings. Practical implications: Dentists have enhanced their infection control practices in response to COVID-19 and may benefit from greater availability of personal protective equipment.
