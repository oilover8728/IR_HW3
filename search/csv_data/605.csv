6040,The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is vulnerable to moderate electric fields.,"Most of the ongoing projects aimed at the development of specific therapies and vaccines against COVID-19 use the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein as the main target. The binding of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor (ACE2) of the host cell constitutes the first and key step for virus entry. During this process, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein plays an essential role, since it contains the receptor binding motif (RBM), responsible for the docking to the receptor. So far, mostly biochemical methods are being tested in order to prevent binding of the virus to ACE2. Here we show, with the help of atomistic simulations, that external electric fields of easily achievable and moderate strengths can dramatically destabilise the S protein, inducing long-lasting structural damage. One striking field-induced conformational change occurs at the level of the recognition loop L3 of the RBD where two parallel beta sheets, believed to be responsible for a high affinity to ACE2, undergo a change into an unstructured coil, which exhibits almost no binding possibilities to the ACE2 receptor. We also show that these severe structural changes upon electric-field application also occur in the mutant RBDs corresponding to the variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil). Remarkably, while the structural flexibility of S allows the virus to improve its probability of entering the cell, it is also the origin of the surprising vulnerability of S upon application of electric fields of strengths at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those required for damaging most proteins. Our findings suggest the existence of a clean physical method to weaken the SARS-CoV-2 virus without further biochemical processing. Moreover, the effect could be used for infection prevention purposes and also to develop technologies for in-vitro structural manipulation of S. Since the method is largely unspecific, it can be suitable for application to other mutations in S, to other proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and in general to membrane proteins of other virus types."
6041,Comparison of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG immuno-assays in RT-PCR negative patients with suspect CT findings.,"A subset of patients with Covid-19 presents with negative RT-PCR screening but suspect CT findings. Using four commercially available anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immuno-assays, we found this subset constituted 9.2% of all consecutively admitted outpatients with Covid-19 in our hospital. Clinical specificity for Covid-19 of some N protein-based immuno-assays was suboptimal, as positive results were observed in control patients with recent common human coronavirus, influenza B and adenovirus infections."
6042,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 in a Proficiency Testing Program.,"Objectives: At the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the United States, testing was limited to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-developed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The urgent and massive demand for testing prompted swift development of assays to detect SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of these newly developed tests. Methods: The American Proficiency Institute sent 2 test samples to 346 clinical laboratories in order to assess the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 assays. The positive sample, containing 5,175 viral copies/mL, was fully extractable with SARS-CoV-2 viral capsid protein and RNA. The negative sample, with 3,951 viral copies/mL, contained recombinant virus particles with sequences for targeting human RNAase P gene sequences. Results: Of the laboratories submitting results, 97.4% (302/310) correctly detected the virus when present and 98.3% (296/301) correctly indicated when the virus was not present. Among incorrect results reported in this proficiency challenge, 76.9% (10/13) were likely related to clerical error. This accounts for 1.6% (10/611) of all reported results. Conclusions: Overall performance in this SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection challenge was excellent, providing confidence in the results of these new molecular tests and assurance for the clinical and public health decisions based on these test results."
6043,"SARS-CoV-2 Exposure in Escaped Mink, Utah, USA.","In August 2020, outbreaks of coronavirus disease were confirmed on mink farms in Utah, USA. We surveyed mammals captured on and around farms for evidence of infection or exposure. Free-ranging mink, presumed domestic escapees, exhibited high antibody titers, suggesting a potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission pathway to native wildlife."
6044,A neonatal cluster of novel coronavirus disease 2019: clinical management and considerations.,"Background: Lately, one of the major clinical and public health issues has been represented by Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy and the risk of transmission of the infection from mother to child. Debate on perinatal management and postnatal care is still ongoing, principally questioning the option of the joint management of mother and child after birth and the safety of breastfeeding. According to the available reports, neonatal COVID-19 appears to have a horizontal transmission and seems to be paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic, compared to older age groups. The aim of this work is to describe a cluster of neonatal COVID-19 and discuss our experience, with reference to current evidence on postnatal care and perinatal management. Methods: This is a retrospective observational case series of five mother-child dyads, who attended the Labor and Delivery Unit of a first-level hospital in Italy, in March 2020. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables consisted of number of observations, mean and the range of the minimum and maximum values. Results: Five women and four neonates tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In one case, the mother-child dyad was separated and the neonate remained negative on two consecutive tests. Two positive neonates developed symptoms, with a predominant involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. Blood tests were unremarkable, except for a single patient who developed mild neutropenia. No complications occurred. Conclusions: We agree that the decision on whether or not to separate a positive/suspected mother from her child should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the parent's will, clinical condition, hospital logistics and the local epidemiological situation. In conformity with literature, in our study, affected neonates were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic. Despite these reassuring findings, a few cases of severe presentation in the neonatal population have been reported. Therefore, we agree on encouraging clinicians to monitor the neonates with a suspected or confirmed infection."
6045,Ocular Surface and Conjunctival Cytology Findings in Patients With Confirmed COVID-19.,"Purpose: To assess the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection on the conjunctiva and tear film. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 31 healthy controls were included in this prospective and observational study. Individuals with COVID-19 formed the patient group, and healthy individuals formed the control group. Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC), TBUT, Schirmer II test, and ocular surface disease index were evaluated in all participants. Results: No significant difference was observed regarding the mean age and gender between the groups (P=0.786 and P=0.122, respectively). The mean TBUT and Schirmer II test results did not differ between the two groups (P=0.496 and P=0.447, respectively). The CIC results revealed decreased density and cell size of goblet cells and moderate to high enlargement, squamous changes, and increased nucleocytoplasmic ratio in nongoblet epithelial cells in the COVID-19 group compared with the control group. Based on the Nelson classification in CIC samples, 60.6% of the COVID-19 group and 19.4% of the control group had changes consistent with grade 2 or above. The presence of neutrophils in CIC was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (P<0.001), whereas the presence of lymphocyte was similar between the two groups (P=0.247). Conclusion: This study revealed the pathological conjunctival alterations in patients with COVID-19 and demonstrated that pathological ocular surface alterations may present even at the beginning of COVID-19 without clinically significant ocular manifestation."
6046,The first report on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine refusal by patients with solid cancer in Italy: Early data from a single-institute survey.,"Introduction: Patients with cancer have an increased risk of complications from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, including death, and thus, they were considered as high-priority subjects for COVID-19 vaccination. We report on the compliance with the COVID-19 vaccine of patients affected by solid tumours. Materials and methods: Patients with cancer afferent to Medical Oncology 1 Unit of Regina Elena National Cancer Institute in Rome were considered eligible for vaccination if they were receiving systemic immunosuppressive antitumor treatment or received it in the last 6 months or having an uncontrolled advanced disease. The Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine was proposed to all candidates via phone or during a scheduled visit. The reasons for refusal were collected by administrating a 6-item multiple-choice questionnaire. Results: From 1st March to 20th March 2021, of 914 eligible patients, 102 refused vaccination (11.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.1-13.2). The most frequent (>10%) reasons reported were concerns about vaccine-related adverse events (48.1%), negative interaction with concomitant antitumor therapy (26.7%), and the fear of allergic reaction (10.7%). The refusal rate (RR) after 15th March (date of AstraZeneca-AZD1222 suspension) was more than doubled compared with the RR observed before (19.7% versus 8.6%, odds ratio [OR] 2.60, 95% CI 1.69-3.99; P < 0.0001). ECOG-PS 2 was associated with higher RR compared with ECOG-PS 0-1 (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.04-8.34; P = 0.04). No statistically significant differences in RR according to other clinical characteristics were found. Conclusions: Our experience represents the first worldwide report on the adherence of patients with cancer to COVID-19 vaccination and underlines how regulatory decisions and media news spreading could influence the success of the campaign."
6047,"Low Prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Among Pregnant and Postpartum Patients With Universal Screening in Seattle, Washington.","We found low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (2.7% [5/188]) among pregnant and postpartum patients with universal testing. Prevalence among symptomatic patients was similar under initial targeted screening (22.2% [4/18]) and universal approaches (19.1% [8/42]). Among 170 asymptomatic patients, 2 were positive or inconclusive, respectively; repeat testing at 24 hours was negative."
