8150,Understanding Antibody Testing for COVID-19.,"The orthopedic community has seen the COVID-19 pandemic decimate elective surgical volumes in most geographies. Patients and essential workers, such as health care providers, remain rightfully concerned about how to appropriately begin to return to work and community activity in a safe and responsible manner. Many believe that testing for the presence of antibodies on a widespread scale could help drive evidence-based decision-making, both on an individual and societal scale. Much information, and an equal amount of misinformation, has been produced on antibody testing. Education about the role and science of such testing is critically important for programs to be effectively understood and managed."
8151,Acceptance and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines: A cross-sectional study from Jordan.,"Vaccines are effective interventions that can reduce the high burden of diseases globally. However, public vaccine hesitancy is a pressing problem for public health authorities. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, little information is available on the public acceptability and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines in Jordan. This study aimed to investigate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and its predictors in addition to the attitudes towards these vaccines among public in Jordan. An online, cross-sectional, and self-administered questionnaire was instrumentalized to survey adult participants from Jordan on the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of COVID-19 vaccines' acceptability. A total of 3,100 participants completed the survey. The public acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines was fairly low (37.4%) in Jordan. Males (OR = 2.488, 95CI% = 1.834-3.375, p < .001) and those who took the seasonal influenza vaccine (OR = 2.036, 95CI% = 1.306-3.174, p = .002) were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, participants who believed that vaccines are generally safe (OR = 9.258, 95CI% = 6.020-14.237, p < .001) and those who were willing to pay for vaccines (OR = 19.223, 95CI% = 13.665-27.042, p < .001), once available, were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. However, those above 35 years old (OR = 0.376, 95CI% = 0.233-0.607, p < .001) and employed participants (OR = 0.542, 95CI% = 0.405-0.725, p < .001) were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, participants who believed that there was a conspiracy behind COVID-19 (OR = 0.502, 95CI% = 0.356-0.709, p < .001) and those who do not trust any source of information on COVID-19 vaccines (OR = 0.271, 95CI% = 0.183-0.400, p < .001), were less likely to have acceptance towards them. The most trusted sources of information on COVID-19 vaccines were healthcare providers. Systematic interventions are required by public health authorities to reduce the levels of vaccines' hesitancy and improve their acceptance. We believe these results and specifically the low rate of acceptability is alarming to Jordanian health authorities and should stir further studies on the root causes and the need of awareness campaigns. These interventions should take the form of reviving the trust in national health authorities and structured awareness campaigns that offer transparent information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and the technology that was utilized in their production."
8152,Detection of low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs using three commercial molecular assays.,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, commercial molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 testing have been rapidly developed and broadly deployed in laboratories worldwide. Although these assays have been reported to correlate well, we sought to compare the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 to the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 or the Lightmix® Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene assay for nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs with low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Thirty-seven NP swabs were studied, including 10 samples with a moderate cycle threshold (Ct) between 30-33.9, and 22 with Ct≥34, and 5 negative for SARS-CoV-2. Overall concordance on initial comparison was 86.5 % (32/37), which was 100 % concordance for samples with Ct values ranging between 30-33.9. Discordance amongst samples showing a Ct ≥34 was 22.7 % (5/22). Endpoint value analysis on the Xpress SARS-CoV-2 within the discordant samples noted two with an endpoint value >5, which were detected by the cobas® or Lightmix®. Testing of SARS-CoV-2 on the three commercial assays was comparable for NP swabs with moderate Ct values, while high Ct values were less concordant. Importantly, analysis of Xpert® endpoint values improved interpretation of discrepant results."

8154,Susceptibility of Well-Differentiated Airway Epithelial Cell Cultures from Domestic and Wild Animals to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, and the number of worldwide cases continues to rise. The zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 and its intermediate and potential spillback host reservoirs, besides humans, remain largely unknown. Because of ethical and experimental constraints and more important, to reduce and refine animal experimentation, we used our repository of well-differentiated airway epithelial cell (AEC) cultures from various domesticated and wildlife animal species to assess their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 replicated efficiently only in monkey and cat AEC culture models. Whole-genome sequencing of progeny viruses revealed no obvious signs of nucleotide transitions required for SARS-CoV-2 to productively infect monkey and cat AEC cultures. Our findings, together with previous reports of human-to-animal spillover events, warrant close surveillance to determine the potential role of cats, monkeys, and closely related species as spillback reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2."
8155,Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease and mortality. The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL. We evaluated humoral immune responses to the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL and compared responses with those obtained in age-matched healthy control subjects. Patients received 2 vaccine doses, 21 days apart, and antibody titers were measured by using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay after administration of the second dose. In a total of 167 patients with CLL, the antibody response rate was 39.5%. A comparison between 52 patients with CLL and 52 sex- and aged-matched healthy control subjects revealed a significantly reduced response rate among patients (52% vs 100%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.010; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.162; P < .001). The response rate was highest in patients who obtained clinical remission after treatment (79.2%), followed by 55.2% in treatment-naive patients and 16.0% in patients under treatment at the time of vaccination. In patients treated with either Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors or venetoclax ± anti-CD20 antibody, response rates were considerably low (16.0% and 13.6%). None of the patients exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies <12 months before vaccination responded. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of response were younger age, female sex, lack of currently active treatment, immunoglobulin G levels ≥550 mg/dL, and immunoglobulin M levels ≥40 mg/dL. In conclusion, antibody-mediated response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL is markedly impaired and affected by disease activity and treatment. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT04746092."

8157,Development strategies of conducting polymer-based electrochemical biosensors for virus biomarkers: Potential for rapid COVID-19 detection.,"Rapid, accurate, portable, and large-scale diagnostic technologies for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are crucial for controlling the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The current standard technologies, i.e., reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, serological assays, and computed tomography (CT) exhibit practical limitations and challenges in case of massive and rapid testing. Biosensors, particularly electrochemical conducting polymer (CP)-based biosensors, are considered as potential alternatives owing to their large advantages such as high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid detection, low cost, simplicity, flexibility, long self-life, and ease of use. Therefore, CP-based biosensors can serve as multisensors, mobile biosensors, and wearable biosensors, facilitating the development of point-of-care (POC) systems and home-use biosensors for COVID-19 detection. However, the application of these biosensors for COVID-19 entails several challenges related to their degradation, low crystallinity, charge transport properties, and weak interaction with biomarkers. To overcome these problems, this study provides scientific evidence for the potential applications of CP-based electrochemical biosensors in COVID-19 detection based on their applications for the detection of various biomarkers such as DNA/RNA, proteins, whole viruses, and antigens. We then propose promising strategies for the development of CP-based electrochemical biosensors for COVID-19 detection."

8159,Advancement in biosensors for inflammatory biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 during 2019-2020.,"COVID-19 pandemic has affected everyone throughout the world and has resulted in the loss of lives of many souls. Due to the restless efforts of the researchers working hard day and night, some success has been gained for the detection of virus. As on date, the traditional polymerized chain reactions (PCR), lateral flow devices (LFID) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are being adapted for the detection of this deadly virus. However, a more exciting avenue is the detection of certain biomarkers associated with this viral infection which can be done by simply re-purposing our existing infrastructure. SARS-CoV-2 viral infection triggers various inflammatory, biochemical and hematological biomarkers. Because of the infection route that the virus follows, it causes significant inflammatory response. As a result, various inflammatory markers have been reported to be closely associated with this infection such as C-reactive proteins, interleukin-6, procalcitonin and ferritin. Sensing of these biomarkers can simultaneously help in understanding the illness level of the affected patient. Also, by monitoring these biomarkers, we can predict the viral infections in those patients who have low SARS-CoV-2 RNA and hence are missed by traditional tests. This can give more targets to the researchers and scientists, working in the area of drug development and provide better prognosis. In this review, we propose to highlight the conventional as well as the non-conventional methods for the detection of these inflammatory biomarkers which can act as a single platform of knowledge for the researchers and scientists working for the treatment of COVID-19."
