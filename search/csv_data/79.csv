780,"Comparative performance of SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR diagnostic assays on samples from Lagos, Nigeria.","A key element in containing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is quality diagnostics which is affected by several factors. We now report the comparative performance of five real-time diagnostic assays. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from persons seeking a diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Lagos, Nigeria. The comparison was performed on the same negative, low, and high-positive sample set, with viral RNA extracted using the Qiagen Viral RNA Kit. All five assays are one-step reverse transcriptase real-time PCR assays. Testing was done according to each assay's manufacturer instructions for use using real-time PCR platforms. 63 samples were tested using the five qPCR assays, comprising of 15 negative samples, 15 positive samples (Ct = 16-30; one Ct = 35), and 33 samples with Tib MolBiol E-gene Ct value ranging from 36-41. All assays detected all high positive samples correctly. Three assays correctly identified all negative samples while two assays each failed to correctly identify one different negative sample. The consistent detection of positive samples at different Ct/Cq values gives an indication of when to repeat testing and/or establish more stringent in-house cut-off value. The varied performance of different diagnostic assays, mostly with emergency use approvals, for a novel virus is expected. Comparative assays' performance reported may guide laboratories to determine both their repeat testing Ct/Cq range and/or cut-off value."
781,[SARS-CoV-2 Detection in cerebrospinal fluid in a pediatric patient. Case report].,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is an emerging infectious agent. The knowledge of both its infectivity mechanisms and the possible complications and specific treatments is the subject of constant research. To understand the involvement of the central nervous system in children, the behavior of this germ is studied based on the neuroinvasive properties of certain respiratory viruses, the neurological damage caused by other coronaviruses, and the clinical manifestations in adults with COVID-19. We describe the clinical case of a 2-month-old patient who consulted for fever without a focus with detection of SARSCoV- 2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal secretions and cerebrospinal fluid. The infant presented good evolution, with resolution of the fever and without compromise or neurological manifestations."
782,Efficient SARS-CoV-2 detection in unextracted oro-nasopharyngeal specimens by rRT-PCR with the Seegene Allplex 2019-nCoV assay.,"Background: The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need to rapidly detect infected people. The challenge for clinical laboratories has been finding a high throughput, cost-efficient, and accurate testing method in the context of extraction reagents shortage on a global scale. To answer this need, we studied SARS-CoV-2 detection in oro-nasopharyngeal (ONP) swabs stored in Universal Transport Media (UTM) or in RNase-free water by rRT-PCR with Seegene Allplex™ 2019-nCoV assay without RNA extraction. Results: Optimal results were obtained when swabs stored in UTM were diluted 1/5 and 1/2 in RNase-free water. Thermal lysis before rRT-PCR testing slightly improved detection rate. In addition, proteinase K (PK) treatment allowed for a significant reduction of invalid results and increased sensitivity for detection of low viral load specimens. In a panel of positive samples with all 3 viral genes amplified and N gene Cycle threshold values (Ct values) from 15 to 40, our detection rate was 98.9% with PK and 94.4% without. In a challenging panel of low positive samples with only the N gene being detectable at Ct values > 30, detection rate was increased from 53.3 to 76.7% with the addition of PK, and invalid rate fell off from 18.3 to 0%. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our method reliably detects specimens with Ct values up to 35, whereas false negative samples become frequent above this range. Finally, we show that swabs should be stored at - 70 °C rather than 4 °C when testing cannot be performed within 72 h of collection. Conclusion: We successfully optimized the unextracted rRT-PCR process using the Seegene Allplex™ 2019-nCoV assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in nasopharyngeal swabs. This improved method offers cost savings and turnaround time advantages compared to automated extraction, with high efficiency of detection that could play an important role in the surveillance of Covid-19."
783,Head-to-head evaluation on diagnostic accuracies of six SARS-CoV-2 serological assays.,"In this study, we evaluated and compared six SARS-CoV-2 serology kits including the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, Beckman Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, OCD Vitros OCD Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total antibody assay, Roche Elecsys Anti SARS-CoV-2 assay, Siemens SARS-CoV-2 Total assay, and cPass surrogate viral neutralising antibody assay. A total of 336 non-duplicated residual serum samples that were obtained from COVID-19 confirmed patients (n=173) on PCR and negative controls (n=163) obtained pre-December 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic were used for the study. These were concurrently analysed on the different immunoassay platforms and correlated with clinical characteristics. Our results showed all assays had specificity ranging from 99.3% to 100.0%. Overall sensitivity across all days of symptoms, in descending order were OCD (49.1%, 95% CI 41.8-56.5%), cPass (44.8%, 95% CI 37.5-52.3%), Roche (41.6%, 95% CI 34.5-49.0%), Siemens (39.9%, 95% CI 32.9-47.3%), Abbott (39.8%, 95% CI 32.9-47.3%) and Beckman (39.6%, 95% CI 32.5-47.3%). Testing after at least 14 days from symptom onset is required to achieve AUCs greater than 0.80. OCD and cPass performed the best in terms of sensitivity for >21 days symptoms with 93.3% (95% CI, 73.5-99.2%) and 96.7% (95% CI, 82.8-99.9%), respectively. Both also shared the greatest concordance, kappa 0.963 (95% CI 0.885-1.0), p<0.001, and had the lowest false negative rates. Serology results should be interpreted with caution in certain cases. False negatives were observed in a small number of individuals with COVID-19 on immunosuppressive therapy, pauci-symptomatic or who received antiretroviral therapy. In conclusion, all assays exhibited excellent specificity and total antibody assays with spike protein configurations generally outperformed nucleocapsid configurations and IgG assays in terms of diagnostic sensitivity."
784,"Prevalence and Time Trend of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Puducherry, India, August-October 2020.","We conducted 3 population-based cross-sectional surveys, at 1-month intervals, to estimate the prevalence and time-trend of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Puducherry, India. Seropositivity rate increased from 4.9% to 34.5% over 2 months and was 20-fold higher than the number of diagnosed cases of infection."
785,"SARS-CoV-2 in saliva, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens.","Introduction: The reference test to evaluate patients with suspected respiratory virus infection is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). However, other specimen collection methods such as an oropharyngeal swab (OPS) or saliva specimen are also used for SARS-CoV-2 testing during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, it remains unclear if rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection differ between sampling methods. This study will compare the rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection by saliva, OPS, and NPS sampling in a public setting. Methods: Individuals referred for outpatient SARS-CoV-2 testing will be invited to participate in a prospective clinical study. They will have saliva, OPS and NPS specimens collected that will be analysed separately for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva, OPS and NPS will be compared using a logistic regression mixed-effect model analysis. A sample of 19,110 participants is required at an expected 1.5% test-positive rate in order to detect a 25.6% difference. The total sample size will be adjusted as the test-positive rate changes. Conclusions: This study will provide evidence for the optimal site of specimen collection to detect SARS-CoV-2. The results may help guide the health authorities. Funding: This is an investigator-initiated trial based on an unrestricted grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Aage og Johanne Louis-Hansens Fond. The foundations have had no say in the decisions on study design or reporting. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT04715607)."

787,Severe acute respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2: Can it be detected in the retina?,"Background/objectives: The systemic organ involvement of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be thoroughly investigated including the possibility of an ocular reservoir in humans. To examine retinal tissues and vitreous for histopathology and SARS-CoV-2 presence with regard to possible effects on the human retina and/ or vitreous. We performed histopathological analyses and quantitative (q)RT-PCR-testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on retinal tissues and vitreous of COVID-19 postmortem donors. Subjects/methods: Included in this study were 10 eyes of 5 deceased COVID-19 patients. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via pharyngeal swabs and broncho-alveolar fluids. The highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) and measures was employed during fluid-tissue procurement and preparation. Histopathological examinations and qRT-PCR-testing were carried out for all retinal tissues and vitreous fluids. Results: The histopathological examinations revealed no signs of morphologically identifiable retinal inflammation or vessel occlusions based on hematoxylin and eosin stains. By qRT-PCRs, we detected no significant level of viral RNA in human retina and vitreous. Conclusions: In this study, no significant level of SARS-CoV-2-RNA was detected in the human retinal and vitreous fluid samples of deceased COVID-19 patients. Histopathological examinations confirmed no morphological sign of damage to retinal vasculature or tissues. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute the results."
788,The First Quarter of SARS-CoV-2 Testing: the University of Washington Medicine Experience.,"In early March 2020, the University of Washington Medical Center clinical virology laboratory became one of the first clinical laboratories to offer testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). When we first began test development in mid-January, neither of us believed there would be more than 2 million confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections nationwide or that we would have performed more than 150,000 real-time PCR (RT-PCR) tests, with many more to come. This article will be a chronological summary of how we rapidly validated tests for SARS-CoV-2, increased our testing capacity, and addressed the many problems that came up along the way."
789,Covid-19 deaths in Africa: prospective systematic postmortem surveillance study.,"Objective: To directly measure the fatal impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in an urban African population. Design: Prospective systematic postmortem surveillance study. Setting: Zambia's largest tertiary care referral hospital. Participants: Deceased people of all ages at the University Teaching Hospital morgue in Lusaka, Zambia, enrolled within 48 hours of death. Main outcome measure: Postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs were tested via reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Deaths were stratified by covis-19 status, location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors. Results: 372 participants were enrolled between June and September 2020; PCR results were available for 364 (97.8%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 58/364 (15.9%) according to the recommended cycle threshold value of <40 and in 70/364 (19.2%) when expanded to any level of PCR detection. The median age at death among people with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was 48 (interquartile range 36-72) years, and 69% (n=48) were male. Most deaths in people with covid-19 (51/70; 73%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 before death. Among the 19/70 people who died in hospital, six were tested before death. Among the 52/70 people with data on symptoms, 44/52 had typical symptoms of covid-19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only five were tested before death. Covid-19 was identified in seven children, only one of whom had been tested before death. The proportion of deaths with covid-19 increased with age, but 76% (n=53) of people who died were aged under 60 years. The five most common comorbidities among people who died with covid-19 were tuberculosis (22; 31%), hypertension (19; 27%), HIV/AIDS (16; 23%), alcohol misuse (12; 17%), and diabetes (9; 13%). Conclusions: Contrary to expectations, deaths with covid-19 were common in Lusaka. Most occurred in the community, where testing capacity is lacking. However, few people who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of covid-19. Therefore, cases of covid-19 were under-reported because testing was rarely done not because covid-19 was rare. If these data are generalizable, the impact of covid-19 in Africa has been vastly underestimated."
