342,Botulinum toxin as an ultrasensitive reporter for bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid diagnostics.,"The rapid identification of pathogenic microorganisms plays a crucial role in the timely diagnosis and treatment strategies during a global pandemic, especially in resource-limited area. Herein, we present a sensitive biosensor strategy depended on botulinum neurotoxin type A light chain (BoNT/A LC) activated complex assay (BACA). BoNT/A LC, the surrogate of BoNT/A which embodying the most potent biological poisons, could serve as an ultrasensitive signal reporter with high signal-to-noise ratio to avoid common strong background response, poor stability and low intensity of current biosensor methods. A nanoparticle hybridization system, involving specific binding probes that recognize pathogenic 16S rRNAs or SARS-CoV-2 gene site, was developed to measure double-stranded biotinylated target DNA containing a single-stranded overhang using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based assay and colorimetric method. The method is validated widely by six different bacteria strains and severe acute respiratory related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid, demonstrating a single cell or 1 aM nucleic acid detecting sensitivity. This detection strategy offers a solution for general applications and has a great prospect to be a simple instrument-free colorimetric tool, especially when facing public health emergency."
343,Saliva is Comparable to Nasopharyngeal Swabs for Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"The continued need for molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the potential for self-collected saliva as an alternative to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for sample acquisition led us to compare saliva to NP swabs in an outpatient setting without restrictions to avoid food, drink, smoking, or tooth-brushing. A total of 385 pairs of NP and saliva specimens were obtained, the majority from individuals presenting for initial evaluation, and were tested on two high-sensitivity reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) platforms, the Abbott m2000 and Abbott Alinity m (both with limits of detection [LoD] of 100 copies of viral RNA/ml). Concordance between saliva and NP swabs was excellent overall (Cohen's κ = 0.93) for both initial and follow-up testing, for both platforms, and for specimens treated with guanidinium transport medium as preservative as well as for untreated saliva (κ = 0.88 to 0.95). Viral loads were on average 16× higher in NP specimens than saliva specimens, suggesting that only the relatively small fraction of outpatients (∼8% in this study) who present with very low viral loads (<1,600 copies/ml from NP swabs) would be missed by testing saliva instead of NP swabs when using sensitive testing platforms. Special attention was necessary to ensure leak-resistant specimen collection and transport. The advantages of self-collection of saliva, without behavioral restrictions, will likely outweigh a minor potential decrease in clinical sensitivity in individuals less likely to pose an infectious risk to others for many real-world scenarios, especially for initial testing. IMPORTANCE In general, the most accurate COVID-19 testing is hands-on and uncomfortable, requiring trained staff and a ""brain-tickling"" nasopharyngeal swab. Saliva would be much easier on both fronts, since patients could collect it themselves, and it is after all just spit. However, despite much interest, it remains unclear how well saliva performs in real-world settings when just using it in place of an NP swab without elaborate or cumbersome restrictions about not eating/drinking before testing, etc. Also, almost all studies of COVID-19 testing, whether of NP swabs, saliva, or otherwise, have been restricted to reporting results in the abstruse units of ""CT values,"" which only mean something in the context of a specific assay and testing platform. Here, we compared saliva versus NP swabs in a real-world setting without restriction and report all results in natural units-the amount of virus being shed-showing that saliva is essentially just as good as NP swabs."
344,Entropy-driven amplified electrochemiluminescence biosensor for RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2 detection with self-assembled DNA tetrahedron scaffolds.,"Dependable, specific and rapid diagnostic methods for severe acute respiratory syndrome β-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) detection are needed to promote public health interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, we have established an entropy-driven amplified electrochemiluminescence (ECL) strategy to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2 known as RdRp-COVID which as the target for SARS-CoV-2 plays an essential role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. For the construction of the sensors, DNA tetrahedron (DT) is modified on the surface of the electrode to furnish robust and programmable scaffolds materials, upon which target DNA-participated entropy-driven amplified reaction is efficiently conducted to link the Ru (bpy)32+ modified S3 to the linear ssDNA at the vertex of the tetrahedron and eventually present an ""ECL on"" state. The rigid tetrahedral structure of the DT probe enhances the ECL intensity and avoids the cross-reactivity between single-stranded DNA, thus increasing the sensitivity of the assays. The enzyme-free entropy-driven reaction prevents the use of expensive enzyme reagents and facilitates the realization of large-scale screening of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Our DT-based ECL sensor has demonstrated significant specificity and high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 2.67 fM. Additionally, our operational method has achieved the detection of RdRp-COVID in human serum samples, which supplies a reliable and feasible sensing platform for the clinical bioanalysis."
345,Discordant SARS-CoV-2 Detection in the Nasopharynx Versus Trachea for Patients With Tracheostomies.,"Objectives/hypothesis: Patients with tracheostomies have an anatomically altered connection between their upper and lower airways that could impact SARS-CoV-2 testing. Our goal was to evaluate for discordance in SARS-CoV-2 detection in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies based on the site analyzed. Study design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: This single-institution study evaluated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who had tracheostomies placed during their treatment. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results after tracheostomy. All included patients had nasopharyngeal (NP) and tracheal (TR) samples taken within a 48-hour period, allowing us to characterize rate of test concordance. Results: Forty-five patients met our inclusion criteria. Thirty-two (71.1%) patients had entirely concordant results after tracheostomy. However, 13 (28.9%) patients had at least one set of discordant results, the majority of which were NP negative and TR positive. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic or clinical variables, including time to tracheostomy and time to testing, among patients with concordant versus discordant SARS-CoV-2 results. Conclusion: This represents the first study to examine SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAAT concordance between NP and TR sites in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies. One-third of patients demonstrated discordant testing when NP and TR specimens were collected within a 48-hour time period. Thus, patients with tracheostomies may have a higher false-negative rate if only one site is assessed for SARS-CoV-2. We recommend analyzing samples from both the nasopharynx and trachea for these patients until more prospective data exist. Level of evidence: 4 Laryngoscope, 131:E2634-E2638, 2021."
346,Catalytic amplification by transition-state molecular switches for direct and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"Despite the importance of nucleic acid testing in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, current detection approaches remain limited due to their high complexity and extensive processing. Here, we describe a molecular nanotechnology that enables direct and sensitive detection of viral RNA targets in native clinical samples. The technology, termed catalytic amplification by transition-state molecular switch (CATCH), leverages DNA-enzyme hybrid complexes to form a molecular switch. By ratiometric tuning of its constituents, the multicomponent molecular switch is prepared in a hyperresponsive state-the transition state-that can be readily activated upon the binding of sparse RNA targets to turn on substantial enzymatic activity. CATCH thus achieves superior performance (~8 RNA copies/μl), direct fluorescence detection that bypasses all steps of PCR (<1 hour at room temperature), and versatile implementation (high-throughput 96-well format and portable microfluidic assay). When applied for clinical COVID-19 diagnostics, CATCH demonstrated direct and accurate detection in minimally processed patient swab samples."
347,Comparison of nine different commercially available molecular assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.,"To face the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for fast and reliable diagnostic assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is immense. We describe our laboratory experiences evaluating nine commercially available real-time RT-PCR assays. We found that assays differed considerably in performance and validation before routine use is mandatory."
348,Description of a late miscarriage case at 16 Weeks of Gestation associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Background: Data about obstetric complications of maternal infection by SARS-CoV-2 remain sparse. Case: A 40-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 3 para 1 with no previous obstetric complications, presented a late miscarriage at 16 weeks of gestation on day 9 of COVID-19 disease. The results of her nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, tested the same day, were negative, but the placenta was infected by SARS-CoV-2 and serology was positive 11 days later. No other obstetric or infectious cause was found to explain this outcome. Conclusion: This case strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may lead to a late miscarriage."
349,Analysis of sputum/tracheal aspirate and nasopharyngeal samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection by laboratory-developed test and Panther Fusion system.,"In this study, 127 sputum/tracheal aspirate specimens were evaluated by a laboratory-developed real-time RT-PCR method and Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay. These specimens were collected from the patients who have nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples being used for SARS-CoV-2 detection previously or simultaneously. The overall agreement was 96% between the lower respiratory tract (LRT) and NPS samples, suggesting that LRT specimens could be an option for patients who develop a productive cough or those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation."
