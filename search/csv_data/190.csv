1890,"COVID-19: Structural Considerations for Virus Pathogenesis, Therapeutic Strategies and Vaccine Design in the Novel SARS-CoV-2 Variants Era.","COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 globally impacted the humanity causing tragic outcomes; costing millions of lives, destroying economies and demolishing public health infrastructures. The emergence of vaccines using various ingenious approaches in less than a year was deemed the light at the end of the tunnel. However, recent emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 in several parts of the world revealed that another hurdle is ahead in the fight against COVID-19. This review will highlight how SARS-CoV-2 mutations, creating different virus variants could potentially impact virus pathogenesis as well as different therapy approaches and vaccine design."

With an increased amount of vaccine research, nanotechnology has found its way into vaccine technology. Researchers have explored the use of various nanostructures for delivering the vaccines for enhanced efficacy. Apart from acting as delivery platforms, multiple studies have shown the application of inorganic nanoparticles in suppressing the growth as well as transmission of the virus. The present review gives a detailed description of various inorganic nanomaterials which are being explored for combating SARS-CoV-2 along with their role in suppressing the transmission of the virus either through air or by contact with inanimate surfaces. The review further discusses the use of nanoparticles for development of an antiviral coating that may decrease adhesion of SARS-CoV-2. A separate section has been included describing the role of nanostructures in biosensing and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The role of nanotechnology in providing an alternative therapeutic platform along with the role of radionuclides in SARS-CoV-2 has been described briefly. Based on ongoing research and commercialization of this nanoplatform for a viral disease, the nanomaterials show the potential in therapy, biosensing, and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2."

1896,Setting minimum clinical performance specifications for tests based on disease prevalence and minimum acceptable positive and negative predictive values: Practical considerations applied to COVID-19 testing.,"Objectives: Several guidelines for the evaluation of laboratory tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have recommended establishing an a priori definition of minimum clinical performance specifications before test selection and method evaluation. Methods: Using positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), we constructed a spreadsheet tool for determining the minimum clinical specificity (conditional on NPV or PPV, sensitivity and prevalence) and minimum clinical sensitivity (conditional on NPV or PPV, specificity and prevalence) of tests. Results: At a prevalence of 1%, there are no minimum sensitivity requirements to achieve a desired NPV of 60%-95% for a given clinical specificity above 20%. It is not possible to achieve 60-95% PPV even with 100% clinical sensitivity, except when the clinical specificity is near 100%. The opposite trend is seen in high prevalence settings (60%), where a relatively low minimum clinical sensitivity is required to achieve a desired PPV for a given clinical specificity, and a higher minimum clinical specificity is required to achieve a desired NPV for a given clinical sensitivity. Discussion: The selection of laboratory tests and the testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 involves delicate trade-offs between NPV and PPV based on prevalence and clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity. Practitioners and health authorities should carefully consider the clinical scenarios under which the test result will be used and select the most appropriate testing strategy that fulfils the a priori defined clinical performance specification."

Methods: In this study, we describe 3 deeply immunocompromised patients, each with different clinical evolutions. We observed (1) the patients' epidemiological, clinical, and serological data, (2) infectiousness using viral culture, and (3) viral mutations accumulated over time. Results: Asymptomatic carriage, symptom resolution, or superinfection with a second severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strain were observed, all leading to prolonged infectious viral shedding for several months. Conclusions: Understanding underlying mechanisms and frequency of prolonged infectiousness is crucial to adapt current guidelines and strengthen the use of systematic polymerase chain reaction testing before stopping isolation in immunocompromised populations."
